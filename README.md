# collecting-data-final-assignment

For this assignment, we looked at how different sources talk about climate change. We scraped data from National Geographic, CNN and Fox News. With this data we used Python to analyze the data 
and analyze how they look at climate change. 

The goal of this project is to analyze how media outlets such as CNN, Fox News, and National Geographic cover the topic of climate change. 
Media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, especially on critical issues like climate change. 
By analyzing the language used in news articles published by these outlets, we can gain insight into their areas of focus and priorities when reporting on climate change and climate change-related issues.

By using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we aim to:

- Identify the most frequently discussed topics and themes.
- Extract and compare key entities (e.g., organizations, people, events).
- Evaluate sentiment trends across different news outlets.

This project uses the following Python-based tools:

spaCy: For Named Entity Recognition (NER) and text preprocessing.
TextBlob: For sentiment analysis.
Collections: For word frequency analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
Wordcloud: For creating visualizations.

Part one consists of collecing the data, loading it, and preprocessing the text. The second part looks at the Named Entity Recognition to analyze the key entities and how they possibly differ
through outlets. The third part consits of doing a sentiment analysis on the three different sources to analyze how their sentiment around climate change differs between them. The last part consits
of active learning exercises.
