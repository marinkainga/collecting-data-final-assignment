Follow the storm tracker for the path and forecasts of the latest storm. The 2022 Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30. The areas covered include the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. The National Weather Service defines a hurricane as a “tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher.” Hurricanes are rated according to intensity of sustained winds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The 1-5 scale estimates potential property damage. A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane. The National Hurricane Center advises preparedness. National Hurricane Preparedness Week is May 1-7, 2022. A hurricane watch indicates the possibility that a region could experience hurricane conditions within 48 hours. A hurricane warning indicates that sustained winds of at least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours. April 7, 2022 - The Colorado State University Tropical Meteorology Project team predicts an “above-normal” Atlantic hurricane season. The team forecasts 19 named storms, including nine hurricanes, four of which will be major hurricanes. On June 2, CSU researchers increase their forecast, calling for a “well above-average” 2022 season. The team now predicts 20 named storms, including 10 named storms, of which five are forecast to be major. May 24, 2022 - The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts a 65% chance for an above-normal season, predicting that there is a 70% chance of having 14 to 21 named storms, of which six to 10 could develop into hurricanes, including three to six major hurricanes (Categories 3-5).

https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/us/plastic-recycling-climate-impact-lbg/index.html,Single-use plastic is wreaking havoc on the planet. Here’s what you can do to minimize your impact,04-22-2023,                                                 Plastic isn’t just a pollution problem. It’s a climate problem. Here’s how you can do your part to reduce its impact.                                             ,"Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our seven-part guide helps you minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety. The life cycle of plastic begins underground, where oil and gas are extracted from deep below the surface of the planet. These fossil fuels are then refined in facilities, using extreme temperatures and significant amount of water and energy, where they are transformed into pellets that are eventually melted and molded into things like water bottles, packaging, garbage bags and clothes. And the widespread use of single-use plastic — the stuff we use once and then throw away — is only made worse by its disposal. Plastics do not break down once they’re thrown into nature. And, alarmingly, only around 9% plastic in the United States is actually recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency — even the stuff you specifically threw into the recycle bin. What you might not realize is this isn’t just a pollution problem. It’s a climate problem. And by the time we start talking about recycling, the damage is already done. The process of making plastic is so energy intensive that if the plastics industry were a country, it would be the fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, according to a 2021 report from Beyond Plastics. Plastics are the “new coal,” said Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator and now president of Beyond Plastics.  Generating energy from coal — the most polluting fossil fuel — is already being phased out. But Enck said it’s likely that plastics may be sticking for a while longer, unless consumers significant cut their plastic use. “It’s a climate killer,” Enck told CNN. “We’re finally seeing an increase in renewable energy and energy efficiency. And the fossil fuel industry knew that they were losing market share on transportation and electricity generation, so plastic production is the plan B for the fossil fuel industry.” From its production to its end-of-life, plastic belches greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its life cycle. Here’s why experts say the convenience of plastic comes at a terrible cost for the climate, and what you can do to help reduce its impact. The plastic industry is responsible for at least 232 million tons of planet-warming emissions each year, according to the Beyond Plastics report. That’s the same amount as the average emissions released by 116 coal-fired power plants in 2020, according to the report’s authors. It’s also the same annual emissions as around 50 million cars, according to the EPA. And more plastic-making facilities continue to come online. “Remember that when you’re making plastic, there’s the greenhouse gas emissions, but these facilities also emit massive amounts of air toxins and particulates,” Enck added. “It’s really a health threat.” Refineries and production facilities also tend to set up shop in marginalized communities of color, Enck said. “If you look at where more than 90% of the climate pollution is released by the plastic industry, it’s in 18 communities in the whole country, and they’re all low-income communities and the residents are more likely to be people of color,” Enck said, outlining other findings in the report. “Plastic production is an environmental justice issue.” And plastic recycling doesn’t work, Enck said, because most of what we think we’re recycling just ends up in the landfill. It also doesn’t address the planet-warming emissions that comes from making it in the first place. Jacqueline Savitz, chief policy officer for Oceana in North America, said people should think of the plastic crisis as an overflowing bathtub. “When the bathtub is overflowing, you don’t want to just run for the mop; first, you want to turn off the faucet,” Savitz said. “Recycling is the mop. You’re not going to get very far, if the faucet is still on. So what we have to do is reduce the amount of plastics that we’re producing at the source, and that’s turning off the faucet.” Recycling alone will not solve this massive problem, Enck said, but we should still do it — bearing in mind what can and cannot be recycled. The number system on the bottom of plastic items are not a guarantee they will be recycled. Only things marked 1 and 2 — and on rare occasion, 5 — are sure bets, depending on what your municipality can handle. This is why it’s so important to focus on reducing plastic use in the first place, Enck said, and our individual changes can add up. “It’s just not going to solve the problem unless we change the law,” Enck said. “But with individual actions, what I urge people to do is look at their own home or their worksite — what is your heaviest use of plastic?” You won’t know what you can change until you take stock. Make note of all of the plastics in your home. Most of the single-use stuff you’ll find around the kitchen and the bathroom. Then, armed with a list of where you use single-use plastic the most, you can start to make replacements. Here are some examples: Say no to bottled water — Get a couple of canteens and cut a major source of plastic out of your life. Reusable grocery bags — You can easily go a step further by not using the plastic produce bags the store provides for your apples and broccoli. If you’re uncomfortable putting produce directly in the cart, have a special bag to carry it in until you get to the checkout. There’s no rule that says you have to wrap your fruits and veggies at the store. Choose paper (or no) packaging over plastic — If you’re looking at two versions of the same product and one is packaged in paper or cardboard and the other is in plastic, then the choice is obvious. And look for plastic-free options like bar shampoo. Buy in bulk to reduce plastic waste — Nuts, rice and beans are all things that come in plastic bags, but they don’t need to. Bring your own reusable containers to fill with your favorite bulk foods. (Just make sure to zero-out the scale before you start filling them, so you don’t pay for the weight of your container.) Refuse plastic cutlery — Take your own utensils to restaurants that typically provide plastics. Or, if you’re ordering takeout, tell the restaurant they don’t need to add it to your bag. And Enck’s group has more suggestions for how to cut your personal plastic use. Ultimately, the world needs large-scale change to address the climate impact of the fossil fuel and plastics industries, Savitz said. Oceana, for example, is working with local volunteers from cities and counties around the country to help pass new laws to reduce single-use plastics, in hopes of sparking change at the national level. “We think that if we could start to reduce single-use plastics at the local level with local ordinances, that can start to become more of the norm,” she said. “Then we can start taking it to higher levels of government, even getting to the point of getting national policies that will drive reductions in plastic use.” Ultimately, Savitz said consumers need to continue urging major corporations to provide plastic-free solutions and help support refill and reuse programs to encourage society to shy away from plastic use and stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis. “Our country is burning and flooding and hurricanes are coming earlier and earlier,” she told CNN. “I really think it’s shocking that one of the things that’s really leading to that is plastics, and it’s hurting us in other ways, too. So if we could find a way to reduce our production of plastics as a country and as a global society, we’d be taking a bite out of climate change.”"

Here’s how to save water at home in your kitchen, bathroom, laundry room and more.                                             ","Kristen Rogers, CNN","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety. The reliability of our faucets providing water every time we turn them on can make water seem like a magical, never-ending resource. But abusing the availability of this finite resource can contribute to water scarcity and harm our capacity to deal with the impact of the climate crisis. “Four billion people today already live in places that are affected by water scarcity at least part of the year,” said Rick Hogeboom, executive director of the Water Footprint Network, an international knowledge center based in the Netherlands. “Climate change will have a worsening influence on the demand-supply balance,” he said. “If all people were to conserve water in some way, that would help ease some of the immediate impacts seen from the climate crisis,” said Shanika Whitehurst, associate director of sustainability for Consumer Reports’ research and testing. Consumer Reports is a nonprofit that helps consumers evaluate goods and services. “Unfortunately, there has been a great toll taken on our surface and groundwater sources, so conservation efforts would more than likely have to be employed long term for there to be a more substantial effect.” Yes, businesses and governments should play a part in water conservation by, respectively, producing goods “water efficiently” and allocating water in a sustainable, equitable way, Hogeboom said. But “addressing the multifaceted water crises is a shared responsibility. No one actor can solve it, nor is there a silver bullet,” he added. “We need all actors to play their part.” Contrary to what you might think, the water used directly in and around the home makes up a minor portion of the total water footprint of a consumer, Hogeboom said. “The bulk — typically at least 95% — is indirect water use, water use that is hidden in the products we buy, the clothes we wear and the food we eat,” Hogeboom said. “Cotton, for instance, is a very thirsty crop.” Of the 300-plus gallons of water the average American family uses every day at home, however, roughly 70% of this use occurs indoors, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency — making the home another important place to start cutting your use. Here are some ways to reduce your water footprint as you move from room to room and outdoors. Since the kitchen involves dishwashing, cooking and one of the biggest water guzzlers — your diet — it’s a good place to start. An old kitchen faucet can release 1 to 3 gallons of water per minute when running at full blast, according to Consumer Reports. Instead of rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, scrape food into your trash or compost bin. Make sure your dishwasher is fully loaded so you only do as many wash cycles as necessary and make the most use of the water. With some activities you can save water by not only using less but also upgrading the appliances that deliver the water. Dishwashers certified by Energy Star, the government-backed symbol for energy efficiency, are about 15% more water-efficient than standard models, according to Consumer Reports. If you do wash dishes by hand, plug up the sink or use a wash basin so you can use a limited amount of water instead of letting the tap run. If you plan on eating frozen foods, thaw them in the fridge overnight instead of running water over them. For drinking, keep a pitcher of water in the fridge instead of running the faucet until the water’s cool — and if you need to do that to get hot water, collect the cold water and use it to water plants. Cook foods in as little water as possible, which can also retain flavor, according to the University of Toronto Scarborough’s department of physical and environmental sciences. When it comes to saving water via what you eat, generally animal products are more water-intensive than plant-based alternatives, Hogeboom said. “Go vegetarian or even better vegan,” he added. “If you insist on meat, replace red meat by pig or chicken, which has a lower water footprint than beef.” It takes more than 1,800 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of beef, Consumer Reports’ Whitehurst said. The bathroom is the largest consumer of indoor water, as the toilet alone can use 27% of household water, according to the EPA. You can cut use here by following this adage: “If it’s yellow, let it mellow. If it’s brown, flush it down.” “Limiting the amount of toilet flushes — as long as it is urine — is not problematic for hygiene,” Whitehurst said. “However, you do have to watch the amount of toilet paper to avoid clogging your pipes. If there is solid waste or feces, then flush the toilet immediately to avoid unsanitary conditions.” Older toilets use between 3.5 and 7 gallons of water per flush, but WaterSense-labeled toilets use up to 60% less. WaterSense is a partnership program sponsored by the EPA. “There’s probably more to gain by having dual flush systems so you don’t waste gallons for small flushes,” Hogeboom said. By turning off the sink tap when you brush your teeth, shave or wash your face, you can save more than 200 gallons of water monthly, according to the EPA. Cut water use further by limiting showers to five minutes and eliminating baths. Shower with your partner when you can. Save even more water by turning it off when you’re shampooing, shaving or lathering up, Consumer Reports suggests. Replacing old sink faucets or showerheads with WaterSense models can save hundreds of gallons of water per year. Laundry rooms account for nearly a fourth of household water use, according to the EPA. Traditional washing machines can use 50 gallons of water or more per load, but newer energy- and water-conserving machines use less than 27 gallons per load. You can also cut back by doing full loads (but not overstuffing) and choosing the appropriate water level and soil settings. Doing the latter two can help high-efficiency machines use only the water that’s needed. If you have a high-efficiency machine, use HE detergent or measure out regular detergent, which is more sudsy and, if too much is used, can cause the machine to use more water, according to Consumer Reports. Nationally, outdoor water use accounts for 30% of household use, according to the EPA. This percentage can be much higher in drier parts of the country and in more water-intensive landscapes, particularly in the West. If you prefer to have a landscape, reduce your outdoor use by planting only plants appropriate for your climate or ones that are low-water and drought-resistant. “If maintained properly, climate-appropriate landscaping can use less than one-half the water of a traditional landscape,” the EPA says. The biggest water consumers outside are automatic irrigation systems, according to the EPA. To use only what’s necessary, adjust irrigation controllers at least once per month to account for weather changes. WaterSense irrigation controllers monitor weather and landscape conditions to water plants only when needed."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/03/europe/europe-heat-records-climate-intl/index.html,‘Uncharted territory’: January heat records smashed across Europe,01/03/2023,                                                 The year has only just started but already Europe has broken an alarming number of weather records as extreme heat spread across the continent.                                             ,"Christian Edwards, CNN","The year has only just started but already Europe has broken an alarming number of weather records as extreme heat spread across the continent. On New Year’s Day, at least eight European countries recorded their warmest January day ever: Liechtenstein, the Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands, Belarus, Lithuania, Denmark and Latvia, according to the climatologist Maximiliano Herrera, who tracks extreme temperatures across the globe. It’s “the most extreme heat wave in European history,” Herrera told CNN, based on how far above normal temperatures rose. Cities that would often be covered in snow instead saw temperatures spike to levels usually seen in summer. “The real ‘monster’ part of this warm spell was December 31 to January 1,” Herrera told CNN. On January 1, Vaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein, recorded a peak of 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit), the Czech town of Javornik reached 19.6 degrees Celsius (67.3 Fahrenheit), and Jodłownik, a village in Poland, recorded a peak of 19 degrees Celsius (66.2 Fahrenheit). Ukraine also recorded its highest temperature in January outside of Crimea. When you consider how far above normal temperatures climbed, the current weather event is even more extreme than the heat waves that scorched much of Europe last summer, said Herrera. And not only is the heat unusually intense, it also spans a large area, from Europe’s borders with Asia to northern Spain. “For the first time, a heat wave in Europe can rival the most intense ever recorded in North America,” said Herrera. The driving force behind the exceptional heat was a warm air mass from the west coast of Africa, which moved across Europe, bringing unseasonably warm conditions, according to the UK Met Office. While meteorologists say it’s too early to confidently attribute this extreme heat to climate change, scientists have warned that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more intense. “The increases in average global temperatures caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels make it more likely that temperature records will be broken,” said Rebecca Oakes, a climate scientist at the Met Office. The record-breaking temperatures have alarmed meteorologists, but they have also had the effect of helping to ease the energy crisis that has gripped the continent. Natural gas prices in Europe soared since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as President Vladimir Putin restricted supply to the continent, and many countries reduced their imports from Russia. But this unprecedented wave of warm weather has meant a lower demand for gas, contributing to natural gas prices slumping to their lowest level since Russia launched its invasion in February last year, according to data from Refinitiv. In Ukraine, the unseasonably warm weather has also helped. “Due to warm weather, [energy] consumption in Ukraine is reduced,” the country’s state-owned electricity operator Ukrenergo announced Tuesday. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Ukrainian government, tweeted on New Year’s Day: “Putin wanted to freeze Ukrainian allies and defeat Ukraine. Instead, even the weather is on our side.” But while the warm weather may provide some relief, meteorologists warn this spell offers a glimpse of a concerning future. Europe has entered “uncharted territory,” said Herrera. “It is one thing to beat even a century old record by few decimals, it is another one to shatter about 5,000 records in two days, in some cases with margin of more than 5 degrees Celsius.”"

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Parts of drought-plagued California are facing an onslaught of powerful storms to start the new year, bringing flooding rainfall and even mud and debris flows to the state. The latest in the series of storms are expected to reach the coast Wednesday morning, and while the entire state will see impacts by the end of Thursday, Northern California and the Bay Area are likely to see the worst of the weather. A so-called “bomb cyclone” over the Pacific Ocean – named because of how rapidly it intensifies over a short period of time – will sling a series of fronts at the West Coast. These fronts are being super-fueled with tropical moisture from a potent atmospheric river that stretches west to Hawaii. While the prolonged wet conditions will provide some relief to the drought conditions, the rain has proved too much too fast. According to the National Weather Service, the storm could trigger more widespread flooding, roads washing out, hillside collapsing, fallen trees, major power outages, “immediate disruption to commerce, and the worst of all, likely loss of human life.” “This is truly a brutal system that we are looking at and needs to be taken seriously,” the NWS Bay Area office added. The storms are called “atmospheric rivers” because they are essentially a conveyor belt of concentrated moisture in the atmosphere emerging from the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean. A similar storm unleashed rains, deadly floods, debris flows and hurricane-force winds, particularly in Northern California including the Bay Area, over the weekend. It’s all happening against the backdrop of a yearslong, climate change-fueled megadrought that has drained the state’s reservoirs and triggered water shortages. These storms usher in much-needed rainfall and snow to the state. But Daniel Swain, climate scientist at the University of California in Los Angeles, said it is not enough to erase the decadeslong deficit that the unrelenting drought has built up. “This is really going to help a lot with the short-term drought in Northern California, perhaps even erase short-term drought conditions, but it’s going to take a lot more to completely obviate the longer term, multi-year drought impacts,” Swain said, emphasizing that Wednesday’s atmospheric event will be a “high-impact storm.” This dramatic swing in periods of drought and high precipitation, or weather whiplash, can occur more often and become more intense under a rapidly warming climate. And scientists say the chances of these sudden transitions happening in California will become much higher, if humans continue to pump out planet-warming gases. Climate researchers have said it’s a lack of precipitation, higher temperatures, and an increase in evaporative demand – also known as the “thirst of the atmosphere” – that has pushed the West’s drought into historic territory. As wells run dry and reservoirs drain, Julie Kalansky, a climate scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, said these storms are desperately needed more than ever to alleviate the drought, despite the hazards they bring in some areas. “They’re two sides of the same coin: they can be extremely beneficial because they bring so much of California’s water supply to the state or they can also be drought busters,” Kalansky told CNN. “But when the duration becomes too long, they become too strong, they come back-to-back, and the landscape doesn’t get an opportunity to absorb all the rain, it can lead to this flooding.” This winter is already showing some signs of respite for a state that’s still almost entirely in drought conditions. Large reservoirs in Northern California including lakes Shasta and Oroville, are slowly being replenished. Meanwhile, smaller reservoirs like Folsom Dam saw an increase of roughly 40 feet of water in three days. Swain said the storms will have largely improved dry conditions in Northern California in the short term. But in the long term, he said climate change has already made its mark and that it would take a lot more than one exceptionally wet year – it will take consecutive wet years and cooler conditions to bust this drought. “In a warming climate, the severity of droughts in places like the Southwest and California are being driven by increasing evaporative demand,” he said. “Essentially, the atmosphere is requiring more water as temperatures rise, so you’d actually need more precipitation than you used to have to balance that out — and we’re not necessarily seeing more precipitation than we used to.” An average atmospheric river carries more than 20 times the water the Mississippi River does, but as vapor. California is prone to floods from these storms as they come ripping off the Pacific Ocean, and major floods from them have happened before — but climate change is raising the stakes with millions of people likely to be impacted. Rainfall in parts of California exceeded 8 inches over the weekend as the last storm moved across the state. Oakland saw its wettest day on record on December 31 when 4.75 inches of rain fell, and San Francisco marked its second-wettest day with 5.46 inches – nearly half of its typical December rain. A 2022 study authored by Swain found that climate change has already doubled the chances of a disastrous megaflood happening in California in the next four decades – a storm unlike anything anyone alive today has ever experienced. And while the recent series of storms isn’t the “big one” yet, the study paints a picture of what the state could face as the planet warms. “We haven’t seen the mega floods, but we have definitely seen hints of increasingly extreme precipitation even in the middle of what has otherwise been a period characterized by a pretty severe and persistent drought,” Swain said. Yet despite this wet start to the year, it’s worth noting that last year was relatively much wetter around this time — and the state was still mired in drought for the remainder of 2022. “The face of droughts is changing,” Swain said. “It’s easier and easier to get into a drought  – even following a really wet winter – because we just have that growing evaporative demand and hotter summers.” “Multi-year droughts are going to look different than they used to,” he said. CNN’s Brandon Miller contributed to this report."

They provide fresh water for nearly 2 billion people and are a key contributor to sea level rise, a threat to the billions of people living along the world’s coastlines. While it has long been known that these giant ice “rivers,” some of which are hundreds of thousands of years old, are hugely vulnerable to the climate crisis, understanding how glaciers will react to different climate scenarios has been a challenge. Data are often regional or otherwise limited in scope, said David Rounce, a glaciologist at Carnegie Mellon University and lead author of the report, which was published on Thursday in the journal Science. The past few years, however, have seen “a revolution in using satellite images to monitor glacier changes,” Rounce said, allowing scientists to come up with estimations for each individual glacier. “That’s really a huge advance compared to previous studies,” he said. Using these new data sets, the researchers made predictions for the fate by the end of the century of the world’s more than 215,000-plus mountain glaciers (excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets) under a range of temperature increases: 1.5 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius. Their modeling projects that glaciers will lose 41% of their mass by the end of the century, compared to 2015, if temperature rises hit 4 degrees Celsius. Even if temperature rises are kept within 1.5 degrees Celsius – a target the world is not currently on track to meet – glaciers are still projected to lose 26% of their mass by the end of the century. Under a best case climate scenario, up to half the world’s glaciers could disappear by 2100, according to the report. Current climate pledges are projected to result in global temperature rise between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2100, according to the United Nations. If that happens, glaciers could almost completely disappear in several regions including central Europe, western Canada and United States, and New Zealand, the report says. “The loss of these glaciers, especially over time horizons that are within our lifetime or our children’s lifetime, is really disturbing,” Rounce said. Shrinking glaciers will also have a clear impact on sea level rise. The researchers project that a 1.5-degree Celsius increase in warming would see 90 millimeters (3.5 inches) of sea level rise, compared to 154 millimeters (6 inches) under a 4-degree Celsius rise. But while significant glacier loss is locked in, every effort to tackle climate change will help reduce further losses, Rounce said. “Even a small reduction in temperature change can have a really big impact.”"

From AI to green energy, here’s what they said.                                             ","Mark Tutton, CNN","The late management guru Peter Drucker once said that “Trying to predict the future is like trying to drive down a country road at night with no lights, while looking out the back window.” When it comes to anticipating new trends in technology, change is happening so fast that the back window may as well be fogged up. 2022 saw NFTs go from flavor of the month to yesterday’s leftovers; cryptocurrency experience a long cold winter; and nuclear fusion take its first steps from the realms of science fiction towards becoming science fact. But for those who follow the latest developments in innovation, it is possible to see patterns in where societies are heading, and forecast which technologies will take them there. As we begin 2023, CNN asked four experts to predict which technologies will shape our lives this year – here’s what they said. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become part of our daily lives, found in everything from e-commerce to social media algorithms. Ayesha Khanna, co-founder and CEO of Addo, an AI and data solutions firm, predicts an explosion of AI-generated images and music in 2023. She adds that while it will not replace humans, “AI will become the new team member for humans in many jobs, contributing ideas and drafts.” Bernard Marr, a futurist and author of books including “Future Skills” and “Business Trends in Practice,” also anticipates that this year, “a focus of AI will be the augmentation of workers, as new tools become available to enable workforces to fully leverage AI.” But Khanna warns that more work will be needed to ensure that generative AI co-pilots – such as GitHub’s Copilot, a tool designed to help developers code – are accurate and unbiased, especially in industries like healthcare, where there could be serious consequences to an AI assistant recommending the wrong treatment to a doctor. Despite Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, losing billions of dollars on its metaverse efforts, the idea of spending time in virtual online worlds is increasingly becoming part of the public consciousness, and the buzz is set to grow in 2023, according to Khanna. “Retail and entertainment companies will launch increasing pilots on how to build customer engagement and loyalty in the various metaverses, especially game platforms like Roblox,” she says. “Metaverse natives who have grown up gaming and socializing in alternate digital realities will drive companies to host concerts, fashion weeks, customer journeys and edutainment activities in 2023.” Marr adds that more small companies will join the bigger organizations that have already established “outposts” on metaverse platforms. “The metaverse will also become more mobile and accessible through devices such as headsets and smart glasses, and businesses will need to consider how they can leverage these opportunities to create immersive and efficient experiences,” he says. “The entire field of sustainability, underpinned by technologies, will play a monumental role in 2023,” says Abishur Prakash, co-founder and geopolitical futurist at the Center for Innovating the Future (CIF), in Toronto, and author of “The World is Vertical: How Technology is Remaking Globalization.” “Clean energy projects, like those taking electricity generated by solar power from Africa to Europe, will advance in 2023, adding a new dimension to the global energy war.” Cynthia Selin, an associate professor at the School for the Future of Innovation in Society and the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University, believes that in 2023, as we continue to build more capacity for renewables, short-term and long-term energy storage such as batteries and hydrogen will be key. “Continued investment and favorable policy conditions … mean that clean hydrogen (including hydrogen made using renewable energy) could see sustained growth, the development of necessary infrastructure, and better cost competitiveness,” she says. “In terms of consumer-facing developments in relation to hydrogen, in ’23 the most likely area of attention will be in long-haul trucking.” Selin believes carbon capture and storage – removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it – will grow in importance. “Direct air capture may continue to gain attention alongside natural removal mechanisms like reforestation,” she says. “New demonstration projects are sprouting up worldwide in tandem with supportive policies, building our capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” Prakash predicts the war in Ukraine will usher in a new era of geopolitics and globalization. “The pursuit of self-reliance, a catalyst of vertical globalization, will accelerate in 2023, affecting every aspect of technology,” he says. “Automakers in China are buying their own ships to export their cars to the world,” he adds, and points to Apple’s plans to move production outside China. Another trend to watch will be the fight over the semiconductors that power our smartphones, computers, automobiles and home appliances. Prakash says semiconductors are set to upend world affairs in 2023, and become an area of competition between the US and China. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of connected sensors and infrastructure that can collect data on everything from household heating to traffic jams on city streets. Selin believes the IoT will continue to transform the energy sector in 2023. “Smart thermostats to track energy consumption and regulate temperatures help in reducing energy consumption and costs. More and more devices are coming to market that use smart sensors and data-driven intelligence to inform energy choices and drive energy efficiency.” Marr predicts 2023 will see a rise in IoT products and services related to health and well-being, “with devices such as smartwatches offering sophisticated sensors for monitoring various health indicators.” He adds that there will also be a focus on “enabling more complex machine-to-machine interactions by developing global standards and protocols that devices can use to communicate with each other, as well as improving IoT security to prevent attacks.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/06/health/epa-air-pollution-standards-climate/index.html,EPA proposes new rule to crack down on deadly air pollution,01/06/2023,"                                                 For the first time since 2012, the US Environmental Protection Agency is proposing an update to the federal air quality standard for fine soot – a long-awaited step to reduce deadly air pollution.                                             ","Ella Nilsen and Angela Fritz, CNN","For the first time since 2012, the US Environmental Protection Agency is proposing an update to the federal air quality standard for fine soot – a long-awaited step to reduce deadly air pollution. The current standard, which has been in place for more than a decade, limits the average annual amount of fine particle pollution to 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air. The EPA is proposing reducing that limit to 9 to 10 micrograms, though it will be taking public comment on a range as low as 8 and as high as 11 migrograms per cubic meter. The final standard will be a single digit somewhere in that range. Fine particulate matter – called PM2.5 – pollutes outdoor air by the burning of fossil fuels like gasoline, diesel and oil, as well as wood. It is the tiniest pollutant yet among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue, where it can enter the bloodstream and can contribute to cardiovascular disease, asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Exposure to this pollution has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer in people who have never smoked. Scientists recently found a possible mechanism for that increased risk – some air pollution particles may promote mutations in cells in the airways. Given the significant health risk, the World Health Organization in 2021 recommended that environmental agencies cut the allowable limit to 5 micrograms per cubic meter of air. Doing so, the organization said, could reduce deaths associated with fine particle pollution by as much as 80%, though there is no amount of air pollution that is completely safe. Though it’s stronger than previous standards, the EPA proposal falls short of the WHO recommendation. Harold Wimmer, the president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said the proposal “misses the mark and is inadequate to protect public health.” “Particle pollution kills,” Wimmer said in a statement. He said the EPA should follow the guidance of medical experts and implement a limit of 8 micrograms per cubic meter. He also noted that a stronger rule is needed for the average daily limit – from the current 35 micrograms per cubic meter to 25. The EPA said it is taking public comment that potential change. Wimmer said health organizations are “united” on this ask. EPA Administrator Michael Regan defended the proposed rule, and said was crafted after “a lot of time looking at all of the new science” and after consultation with the experts within EPA “as well as our stakeholders.” “We arrived to this space based on sound science and rigorous evaluation of the data that we have at hand,” Regan told reporters. The administrator further emphasized the new standard would help advance the agency’s environmental justice goals. Black and brown communities are disproportionately exposed to particulate matter coming from industrial facilities and highways. Dr. Doris Browne, an oncologist and the president of the National Medical Association, said the EPA’s proposal “will have a lasting impact,” especially on communities of color. “I’ve spent my career advocating for health equity and environmental justice, because no one should be sickened by the environment in which they live,” Browne told reporters. “Harmful carbon pollution and smog have a lasting and devastating impact on public health, and strengthening air quality standards means healthier, more sustainable communities.” The EPA is required by law to update the standards for fine particulate pollution every five years and according to the latest available science. The last time they were updated under the Obama administration in 2012, they were lowered from 15 to 12 micrograms per cubic meter. The standards were not tightened during the Trump administration. The Trump administration decision prompted an outcry among environmental and public health groups. Then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the US had already “made incredible strides in reducing particulate matter concentrations” and did not need to further increase the standard. But Wheeler’s comments directly contradicted the recommendation of the EPA’s own scientists, which found that further tightening soot regulations could save thousands of lives. Even with the proposed update, the Biden administration is running behind schedule. When Regan initially announced the EPA would consider stricter limits on soot, the agency’s timeline was proposing a draft rule by summer 2022, finalizing the rule in spring of this year. Friday’s proposed rule will undergo a public comment period and is expected to be finalized later this year."

Activists have blocked roads and bridges, glued themselves to trains, smashed bank windows and sprayed fake blood over buildings.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","Climate activist group Extinction Rebellion is best known for its attention-grabbing tactics. Activists have blocked roads and bridges, glued themselves to trains, smashed bank windows and sprayed fake blood over buildings. But in two words headlining a New Year’s Eve statement, the group signaled a radical change. “We Quit,” it announced. Extinction Rebellion – widely known as XR – said it had made the “controversial resolution” to temporarily abandon tactics of mass public disruption, just as other climate groups plan to scale them up. Instead, the group said it will focus on trying to build its numbers and become a more inclusive organization, including trying to attract people who may have felt alienated by its previous tactics. Founded in 2018, XR has changed the face of climate protest. Its aim was to draw attention to bleak climate predictions by showing just how far activists were willing to go to demand change, including arrests and jail time. And the strategy worked, to an extent. XR, which now has hundreds of affiliates across the world, became a household name. But its blunt tactics came at a cost: unpopularity. The group has also found itself operating in a trickier landscape. Tighter anti-protest laws in the UK have sought to criminalize many of the tactics favored by climate organizations, upping the stakes for activists. The decision to move away from disruptive protest is a big shift and “wasn’t taken lightly,” said XR spokesperson Marijn van de Geer. “But we feel there’s now this space where we can try something different and perhaps be a place especially for people from backgrounds where arrest is something extremely frightening.” As the impacts of climate change intensify – marked particularly in Europe by last summer’s blistering heatwaves – the group believe people will be more open to its message. Conditions for change “have never never been more favourable,” XR said. But as XR pulls back, some of the environmental groups that have sprung up in its wake are ramping up mass disruptive protests. The UK group Just Stop Oil have glued themselves to roads, ziplocked their necks to goal posts, blockaded oil facilities and targeted iconic artwork. In October, in one of their most high-profile protests, they flung tomato soup over Vincent van Gogh’s famous “Sunflowers” at a London Gallery. Members of the German group Letzte Generation (Last Generation) have glued themselves to roads and thrown mashed potato over a Monet painting, while their Italian counterparts, Ultima Generazione, threw pea soup over another Vincent van Gogh. As 2023 begins, many of these groups have pledged to go further. Letzte Generation said it will double down on protests and is prepared for more arrests and jail time – seven of its members spent Christmas and New Year behind bars. Spokesperson Carla Rochel told CNN: “We will continue to block motorways in the new year; we will stand in the governmental district and directly confront those responsible; we will go to concert halls, football stadiums, museums, political party headquarters and all areas of society.” Just Stop Oil is also planning to ramp up disruption. “We are barreling down the highway to the loss of ordered civil society, as extreme weather impacts tens of millions,” Indigo Rumblelow, a spokesperson for Just Stop Oil, told CNN in a statement, adding, “it is time to escalate, from disobedience into civil resistance.” Disruptive protests have succeeded in gaining attention but they have also attracted waves of criticism for disrupting daily life, delaying emergency services and damaging cultural heritage. Herein lies the “activists’ dilemma,” said Robb Willer, director of the Polarization and Social Change Lab at Stanford University. Activists want to reach the public through the mass media but the best ways of achieving this are often unpopular. Feyzi Ismail, a lecturer in global policy and activism at Goldsmiths, University of London, said that while shocking, creative tactics are needed, “preventing ordinary people from getting to work or hospital doesn’t advance our cause.” Willer’s research has found that disruptive protest tactics tend to reduce public support, but there are still reasons groups might want to pursue them, he said. For smaller, early stage organizations, it can be a way to gain profile and recruit members. Campaign group Insulate Britain, for example, started blocking major roads in 2021 to demand low-carbon insulation retrofitting in the country’s public housing. Videos of motorists angrily dragging protestors off roads, with one driver even nudging her SUV into an activist, made a group with an unsexy-sounding cause suddenly very high profile. Disruptive tactics from a radical climate organization can also help draw people to more moderate organizations, according to a theory known as the “radical flank” effect. XR may be hoping to scoop up those alienated by the actions of groups like Just Stop Oil, said Willer. XR plans to spend the next 100 days building support for an April demonstration, which they hope will see 100,000 people surround the Houses of Parliament. The ultimate aim, van de Geer said, is to prove “it’s not just a bunch of tree hugging hippies that are concerned; it’s everyone, and everyone wants action.”"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","In rare good news for the planet, Earth’s ozone layer is on track to recover completely within decades, as ozone-depleting chemicals are phased out across the world, according to a new United Nations-backed assessment. The ozone layer protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet rays. But since the late 1980s, scientists have sounded the alarm about a hole in this shield, caused by ozone-depleting substances including chlorofluorocarbons, dubbed CFCs, often found in refrigerators, aerosols and solvents. International cooperation helped stem the damage. The use of CFCs has decreased 99% since the Montreal Protocol went into force in 1989, which began the phase-out of those and other ozone-harming chemicals, according to the assessment by a panel of experts published on Monday. If global policies stay in place, the ozone layer is expected to recover to 1980 levels by 2040 for most of the world, the assessment found. For polar areas, the timeframe for recovery is longer: 2045 over the Arctic and 2066 over the Antarctic. “Ozone action sets a precedent for climate action. Our success in phasing out ozone-eating chemicals shows us what can and must be done – as a matter of urgency – to transition away from fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gases and so limit temperature increase,” said Secretary General for the World Meteorological Organization Petteri Taalas. Ozone-depleting gases are also potent greenhouse gases, and without a ban the world could have seen additional warming of up to 1 degree Celsius, according to a 2021 study in the journal Nature. The planet has already warmed around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution, and scientists have warned that it should be limited to 1.5 degrees to prevent the worst consequences of the climate crisis. Warming beyond 1.5 degrees would dramatically increase the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages, scientists have reported. For the first time in this assessment, which is published every four years, scientists also looked at the prospect of solar geoengineering: the attempt to reduce global warming through measures such as spraying aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight out of the earth’s atmosphere. They found stratospheric aerosol injection could help reduce climate warming but warned there may be unintended consequences. Deploying the technology “could also affect stratospheric temperatures, circulation and ozone production and destruction rates and transport,” the report, published every four years, found."

But there may be a way to hang on to the water.                                             ","René Marsh, CNN","California has gone from extreme drought to extreme flooding in a matter of days. On Monday, 90% of the state’s population was under a flood watch as another round of storms rolled through. Yet it was just last week when several counties in the state were experiencing the exact opposite – exceptional drought, which the US Drought Monitor considers the most severe category. California’s parade of ultra-wet storms has not completely reversed the deeply rooted drought. And scientists warn that it has a long way to go to erase years unfavorable precipitation trends and water supply overuse. But the abrupt shift from drought warnings to flood warnings highlights the dilemma California faces: How do you manage an overwhelming amount of rain in a water-scarce state? And is it possible to harness that water so it’s available in the dry summer months? Part of the solution, climate scientists told CNN, is drawing levees back to allow rivers more room to flood safely into surrounding land. “We have to let our rivers flow differently, and let the rivers flood a little more and recharge our groundwater in wet seasons,” Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and co-founder of the Pacific Institute in Oakland, told CNN. “Instead of thinking we can control all floods, we have to learn to live with them.” Levees have effectively protected communities in the past, Gleick said, but they’re not designed for the climate-change challenges of today. “We need new thinking, we need to operate that infrastructure differently, we need to change some of the characteristics of that infrastructure,” Gleick said. “That will allow us to capture more of these flood flows, store it underground in these aquifers, and then use those ground water resources when we need them in dry years.” Many climate experts agree – using levees to prevent floods during the wet season means less water is available to seep into underground aquifers. Those aquifers are a vital source of water for drinking, bathing and agriculture across California’s Central Valley, and they are running dry. But giving rivers more space to flood has a catch. It means entire communities would need to relocate; the process is known as managed retreat. Nicholas Pinter, a researcher and professor of applied geosciences at the University of California at Davis, acknowledged managed retreat is a tall task but noted other countries are doing it. “We are behind the curve on this,” Pinter told CNN. “The Europeans in the 1990s started doing this. They made a multi-billion-euro investment to draw levees back.” Pinter said the US has always leaned toward building infrastructure to provide protection. “We have always had an engineering mentality with strong property rights,” Pinter said. “There’s also an intense resistance by property owners when it comes to giving up their property rights.” There’s also the threat of pushback from political leaders worried about property tax revenue loss and the loss of land for building and development, Pinter said. A concept like managed retreat requires a mentality shift that will be extremely difficult to achieve, Gleick said. “These changes are absolutely easier said than done but they have to be done.” Both Pinter and Gleick said managed retreat is just one tool in the box when it comes to adapting to more extreme weather. Gleick noted there are a litany of other policies states should consider. “We have to redesign insurance policies so that we are not rebuilding houses once they’ve been damaged in the same places where they are going to flood again, Gleick said. “We have to design flood insurance policies to encourage people to move away from flood plains, so we can open up those floodplains, so when we get those floods they will be less damaging.”Top photo caption: A home is flooded in Gilroy, California, on Monday, January 9.

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","The United States was lashed by 18 catastrophic extreme weather and climate disasters costing at least $1 billion each last year, a new report shows. They came in the form of tornadoes, extreme heat and cold, deadly flooding and hurricanes and a climate change-fueled drought in the West. When taken together, the country’s so-called billion-dollar disasters inflicted at least $165 billion in damage last year — surpassing 2021 disasters in cost — and caused at least 474 deaths, according to the report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Hurricane Ian, the Category 4 storm that left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean and Florida, carried the highest economic toll of nearly $113 billion, along with a death toll of 152, NOAA reported. The second-costliest disaster was a blistering summer heat wave and the historic drought, which spread from the West to the Mississippi River, totaling about $22.2 billion in damages. Over the last seven years, 122 separate billion-dollar disasters have killed at least 5,000 people and cost the US more than $1 trillion in damages, the agency said. At the annual meeting of the American Meteorological Society this week, where NOAA officials will present their findings, scientists say the fingerprints of climate change are all over these extreme weather disasters. “What we’ve learned over the past 20 years is that extreme events are the face of climate change,” Stephanie Herring, climate scientist at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, told journalists on Monday. People may not notice a small change in global average temperature, Herring said, but those changes “have huge impacts” on the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Five of the last six years, except 2019, have seen disasters exceed the $100-billion mark, a signal that extreme weather events are becoming more costly and destructive as climate change accelerates. “We’re talking big money here and it’s consistent,” Adam Smith, applied climatologist with NOAA who led the report, told CNN. “This is another trend where the cost and the impacts are quite large and so we need to think about how to better mitigate future damages because we know these extremes will continue to happen.” Last year’s financial toll was third-highest on record so far, behind 2020 and 2021. But Smith noted the total cost could rise several billion dollars once NOAA accounts for the damages of the late-December blizzard and cold snap. “We’re still calculating the cost of that event, which was so late in the year, but it’s clearly a several billion-dollar event and will actually add to the total we already have of $165 billion,” Smith said. “So the total of 2022 will actually exceed $165 once we add the Christmas, winter storm impacts on top of that number.” Last year closed with a series of disastrous storms in the West, and California is still being hammered by torrential rain, causing destructive flooding. Scientists have found climate change is not just increasing the severity of extreme weather, it is interrupting the usual patterns and causing wild swings between dry and wet extremes. In California, the multiyear drought has dried out the land so intensely, it is less able to absorb heavy rainfall, making flooding more likely. Smith underscored a few main factors contributing to the growing economic toll, including how people continue to move into harm’s way and the increased vulnerability given where and how structures are built. And then there’s the climate crisis: “Climate change is intensifying many of these extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters,” Smith said. President Joe Biden in August signed the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, which contains $370 billion for climate and clean energy tax credits and new programs. Analysts and estimates from the lawmakers show the law would significantly cut planet-warming emissions, which scientists say would ultimately lead to fewer and less-extreme climate disasters. The funding, which is designed to be applied over the course of 10 years, pales in comparison to what the US is now spending each year on disasters. “Time is of the essence,” Smith said. “Because all of these extremes, impacts, disasters, and fatalities have happened, there’s so many different lessons across many parts of the country, for many different disaster types and many different populations that we can start to implement. And sooner is certainly better.” NOAA’s annual report only captures the costliest disasters and serves as a snapshot to quantify the toll of extreme weather and climate change across the US. Globally, extreme weather events in 2022 cost roughly $270 billion, new data from reinsurance company Munich Re shows. Hurricane Ian was the costliest disaster in Munich Re’s report, followed by the deadly flooding in Pakistan. An extreme weather event or climate disaster occurred every day, on average, somewhere in the world over the last 50 years, the World Meteorological Organization reported in 2021, and the frequency of such events increased by a factor of five over the same period. Around the world, the economic toll of the disasters has climbed sevenfold since the 1970s, the UN agency found. Hurricane Ian, September 28-30: $112.9 billion Western/Central drought and heat wave, 2022: $22.2 billion Central US derecho, June 13: $ $3.2 billion Western wildfires, spring and fall: $3.1 billion North Central severe weather, May 11-12: $2.8 billion Southern severe weather, April 11-13: $2.8 billion Hurricane Fiona, September 17-18: $2.5 billion North Central hail storms, May 19: $2.5 billion North Central hail storms, May 9: $2.2 billion Central severe weather, June 7-8: $1.9 billion Kentucky and Missouri Flooding, July 26-28: $1.5 billion Southeastern tornado outbreak, April 4-6: $1.5 billion Southern tornado outbreak, March 30: $1.3 billion North Central and Eastern severe weather, July 22-24: $1.3 billion Southern and Central severe weather, May 1-3: $1.2 billion Hurricane Nicole, November 10-11: $1 billion Texas hail storms, February 21-22: $1 billion Central and Eastern winter storm and cold wave, December 21-26: To be determined"

","Ivana Kottasová, CNN","The last eight years have been the eight warmest on record as the growing concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere pushes global temperatures toward a dangerous tipping point, a new report shows. An analysis by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service published on Tuesday said that 2022 was the fifth-warmest year for the planet since records began. It also reported Europe recorded its warmest summer last year and its second warmest year overall, exceeded only by 2020. Copernicus described 2022 as “a year of climate extremes” that brought record-breaking heatwaves in Europe, deadly floods in Pakistan, extreme widespread flooding in Australia, and that saw the Antarctic Sea reach its lowest minimum extent on record. The report said that annual average temperature reached 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, marking the eighth year in a row of temperatures at least 1 degree above the 1850 to 1900 reference period. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, most countries agreed to limit warming to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, but preferably to 1.5 degrees. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identified the 1.5-degree mark as a key threshold and said breaching it would dramatically increase the risk of extreme weather events and irreversible changes. Svitlana Krakovska, who heads the Ukrainian delegation to the IPCC, has an analogy for anyone wondering what difference a few degrees of warming could make. “Your normal body temperature is 36.6. Now we have plus [1.2] degrees and we are already sick. And if we will have 1.5, or 2, look at the difference. We cannot allow this,” she told CNN at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt in November. “Every bit of warming matters,” she said. The Copernicus report also highlighted the rising atmospheric concentration of CO2 and methane, potent greenhouse gasses that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet. Before humans started to burn large quantities of fossil fuels, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was around 280 parts per million. According to Copernicus, it hit an annual average of 417 parts per million in 2022, an increase of 2.1 parts per million compared to 2021. Records show the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere has not been this high in around 2 million years, Copernicus added. The IPCC has said that the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 to have any chance of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say the link between the greenhouse gasses concentrations and the rising temperatures is unmistakable. “The tumbling of temperature records combined with the unprecedented heatwaves, droughts and intense rainfall and flooding events across the planet, along with the sustained global warmth over the past decade, are all entirely consistent with a world rapidly warming,” Richard Allan, professor in climate science at the University of Reading, told CNN in an email. Allan said this is happening because of “the additional heating effect of the greenhouse gases we’re collectively pumping out into the atmosphere.” Scientists said 2022 was an exceptionally warm year despite the La Niña phenomenon, which has now been observed for three consecutive years and which normally leads to cooler global average temperatures. “It is very likely that the recent La Niñas have been masking some of the warming from global climate change,” said Marybeth Arcodia, a postdoctoral researcher at Colorado State University. She added that because El Niño – the opposite phase of La Niña – tends to cause higher than average temperatures, it is “probable that when the next El Niño occurs, the global average temperature will be higher than what we have been seeing in the past few years.” The Copernicus report comes just days after the UK Met Office announced that 2022 was the UK’s hottest year on record, with an average temperature of over 10 degrees Celsius recorded for the first time. In a report released last week, the Met Office said that human-induced climate change has made the record-breaking annual temperature around 160 times more likely. Its scientists calculated that what would normally be around “one in 500 year annual temperature” is now likely every three to four years because of climate change. Météo-France, the French national meteorological service, said Friday that 2022 was the hottest year in mainland France since records began in 1900, adding that eight of the warmest 10 years on record occurred since 2010. It said the extreme heat France experienced in 2022 was a “clear sign of climate change” and that similar temperatures could become the norm by mid-century. Italy’s Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences said 2022 was the hottest year on record for Italy, while the German National Meteorological Service said 2022 was “at least” tied for the hottest year on record with 2018, and could surpass 2018 once final data is analyzed this month. CNN’s Allison Chinchar contributed reporting."

Wildfires hit during the middle of the COVID pandemic, and now ...",Opinion by Amy Ettinger,"Editor’s Note: Amy Ettinger is a journalist and the author of “Sweet Spot: An Ice Cream Binge Across America.”  Her work can be found at www.amyettinger.com. Read more opinion at CNN. My 13-year-old daughter and I walked along the flooded banks of the San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz, surveying the damage of the latest storm. There were large pieces of driftwood and other detritus swirling in the brown, rushing current. “What do you think is worse: the floods or the fires?” I asked her. She didn’t need to pause for long before answering. “Definitely the fires because of the smell,” she said. It was, to be fair, an impossible choice – especially for a child barely into her teens. The apocalyptic weather in California is upending all of our lives, but that’s true for no one more so than for our kids. Julianna has lived in California for all of her life and has learned to live with the temperamental, destructive nature of its environment. In August 2020, the CZU Lightning Complex Fire ignited the mountain areas near our house. Crews have been busy in recent days clearing neighborhoods and roadways destroyed by heavy downpours and strong winds, forcing thousands of evacuations. Forecasters say another round of unprecedented rain could soon be on its way, and new devastation emerges almost before the debris has been cleared away. The storms that have buffeted my home state in recent weeks have left at least 17 people dead as much of the state received rainfall totals 400% to 600% above average. In 2020, relentless wildfires saw more than 80,000 acres burn and more than 900 homes destroyed leaving blackened scars that are still visible when we drive along the sweeping cliffs of the Pacific Coast Highway. We were fortunate that our rental home was miles away from the evacuation zones. But smoke throughout the region was so pervasive and so severe that we needed to stay inside for days at a stretch with the windows closed and a MacGyvered box fan-turned-air purifier running at all times. The fires hit during the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the terrible air quality, meant we lost access to nature at the time when we needed it the most. So we stayed inside and watched news reports of the destruction. Now, there’s no telling how much new damage we’ll see each day when we emerge from our homes. With this current disaster, as with the last, we’re experiencing a familiar feeling of doom. Schools are canceling classes this week amid flooding so severe that it has washed away cliff faces, as well as the bridges we’re used to crossing every day. Scientists may debate whether the latest series of storms is due to climate change, but there’s no doubt that the Golden State is being hit by more extreme weather events. That has meant that all of us – at every age – have had to become more familiar with tell-tale signs of impending bad weather. Any child who lives here can tell you that you need to plan for potential smoke in the fall because the dry, drought-ravaged hillsides can spark in a moment. Now, Julianna will also have the memory of what it’s like to watch basic infrastructure like roads and bridges wash away from the rain. The World Health Organization has said that climate change poses a threat to mental health and well-being. Even among adults, the extreme conditions create a hypervigilance that can never completely be turned off. You try to fall back asleep after being awakened in the middle of the night by howling winds – or the stifling heat or the pounding rain – but your brain starts to imagine the life-threatening devastation. The emotional strain can be even greater for young people. The deadly heat, fires and flooding wrought by climate change have spawned an ever-present eco-anxiety in youth. In a 2021 survey of teens and young adults, 60% of respondents said they felt “very worried” or “extremely worried” about climate change. The survey polled 10,000 young people in 10 countries about climate change and how well they felt their government responses to it have been. When asked how they felt about our volatile climate, the most commonly chosen answers were “sad,” “afraid,” “anxious,” “angry” and “powerless.” Overall, 45% of participants said their feelings about climate change impacted their daily lives. I know what it’s like to live without those worries, but my daughter does not. They have become a part of her, like the freckles that emerge on her face after days in the California sunlight. In a region that has seen massive devastation from both fire and flood in the space of a few short years, it’s shocking to witness how quickly a landscape can change. As Julianna’s 13-year-old friend Talula put it, “The storm has a thundering effect on the people around us, and it rains down on the unfortunate more than anyone else.” In addition to learning about the impermanence of things around us that once seemed immutable and the destructive power of nature, my daughter and her peers are also learning that rebuilding takes time. It’s a slow process to bring back what’s been violently destroyed. So far, more than 100 permits have been issued to rebuild the houses that were destroyed by the fire – but that’s just a fraction of the number of dwellings destroyed. Many of the state parks that burned have only recently reopened. Now, the recovery from these storms will cost tens of millions and will be a years-long process. That kind of work happens on a community level, for those who stick it out. Some people I know have chosen to leave the area rather than rebuild from the fires. Others keep an extensive emergency evacuation bag constantly ready. Long after Covid-19 is endemic, my family will still have KN95 masks and air purifiers in the house in anticipation of next year’s wildfire season. We will likely stay close to home during the rainy season, just in case. These are just the realities of raising a child in California in the 21st century. As more of these mass climate events happen in coming years, it is the children who will have to deal with the fall out. A few days ago, after one of the storms splintered Santa Cruz’s Capitola Wharf, a beloved local landmark, we drove the mile or so from our house to take a look. We drive past it several times a week, and it was shocking to see the way part of it had fallen off into the ocean. The businesses at the end of the wharf were cut off from the rest of the city. We surveyed the damage as tourists and photojournalists snapped photos and children built forts with driftwood from a nearby beach. “They’ll fix it, right?” Julianna finally asked. “Yes, I’m sure they will. But all the cleanup will cost millions,” I answered. “But there are only a few businesses there,” she said, already doing the complicated math in her head. Did the historic nature of the landmark warrant the cost and effort? This is the legacy our children will be left with. They will be engaged in a never-ending question of weights and balance, making difficult choices about what we rebuild and what gets washed away for good."

","Ivana Kottasová, CNN","The world’s oceans were the warmest on record for the fourth year in row in 2022, a troubling sign of the climate crisis caused by humans pumping heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. A study by an international team of scientists from 16 institutes worldwide found that the five hottest years for oceans all happened in the past six years and that the speed at which oceans are warming is getting increasingly fast. Published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences on Wednesday, the study looked at temperatures from the ocean surface to 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) deep, examining data going back to the 1950s. The results are worrying. “The state of our oceans can measure the world’s health, and judging by the updated oceanic observations … we need a doctor,” the team of authors said in an accompanying press release. In terms of energy, the amount of heat added to the oceans in 2022 is equivalent to 100 times the total global electricity generation last year, the researchers said. Oceans serve as a good indicator of the real impact of climate change because compared to air temperatures, they are less affected by seasonal changes and day-to-day weather cycles. Covering almost three quarters of Earth’s surface, oceans absorb the vast majority of the world’s heat. Since 1970, more than 90% of the planet’s excess heat went into the oceans, the study said. The scientists said that the global long-term warming trend is now so steady and robust that annual records continue to be set every year. “Until we reach net zero emissions, that heating will continue, and we’ll continue to break ocean heat content records, as we did this year. Better awareness and understanding of the oceans are a basis for the actions to combat climate change,” said Michael Mann, professor at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the authors of the study. Warming oceans have a major impact on the lives of millions of people. They supercharge weather patterns to create more powerful storms, hurricanes and intense rainfall and make it easier for storms to rapidly intensify, as happened with Hurricane Ian, which hit the Caribbean and Florida in late September. The warming is also a key driver of sea level rise, because extra heat causes oceans to expand. When water gets warmer, its molecules move faster and spread out more, which increases its volume. This leads to more coastal erosion and storm surges – such as when Hurricane Nicole hit Florida’s Daytona Beach area in November. Rising temperatures also mean ocean waters have less oxygen, which affects marine life, hurting fishing communities and their economies. It’s not just the oceans that are warming rapidly. An analysis by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service published on Tuesday showed that last eight years have been the eight warmest on record, as the growing concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere pushes global temperatures toward a dangerous tipping point. CNN’s Rachel Ramirez and Brandon Miller contributed reporting."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","ExxonMobil’s own scientists accurately predicted future global warming in reports dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, despite the company publicly continuing for years to cast doubt on climate science and lobby against climate action, according to a new analysis. Researchers examined climate projections produced between 1977 and 2003 by Exxon, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies. They found the company’s science was not only good enough to predict long term temperature rise, but also accurately predicted when human-caused climate change would become discernible, according to the report published Thursday in the journal Science. A slew of internal Exxon documents unearthed by researchers and journalists over the past few years have shown that the company was aware of the link between fossil fuels and climate change at least as far back as the 1970s. But until now, there hasn’t been an in-depth review of Exxon’s own climate modeling data, said Geoffrey Supran, a research fellow in the history of science at Harvard University and a co-author of the report. This is “the first-ever systematic assessment of the fossil fuel industry’s climate projections,” Supran told CNN. The researchers analyzed more than 100 reports by Exxon scientists, produced between 1977 and 2014. They then whittled these down to 12 documents containing climate projections and compared them against historical observations. Between 63% to 83% of the projections were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming and their projections were also consistent with independent academic models, the report found. The company’s climate modeling showed “shocking skill and accuracy,” Supran said. Exxon projected an average warming of around 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade, according to the report. “That allows us for the first time to put a number on what Exxon knew, namely that fossil fuel burning was going to hit the planet by 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade,” Supran said. Exxon was “on the money” on various other topics, said Supran, including accurately predicting that human-caused climate change would be first detectable around the year 2000, as well as estimating how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming. “I see this as ‘Exxon knew 2.0,’” Supran said, referring to the #ExxonKnew campaign launched by climate activists in the wake of earlier revelations that Exxon has long known about the link between its products and climate change. “We now have tight, unimpeachable evidence that ExxonMobil accurately predicted global warming years before it turned around and publicly attacked climate science,” Supran said. Todd Spitler, a spokesperson for Exxon, said in a statement that “ExxonMobil is committed to being part of the solution to climate change and the risks it poses,” and “those who talk about how ‘Exxon knew’ are wrong.” Addressing Exxon’s climate research, Spitler said the company has produced “nearly 150 papers, including more than 50 peer-reviewed publications that the Company has made available to the public.” “ExxonMobil’s understanding of climate science has developed along with that of the broader scientific community,” he said. Despite its own modeling showing fossil fuel use would lead to global warming, Exxon’s public communications raised doubt about climate change, including taking out ads in major publications suggesting climate science was poorly understood and scientists were divided. “When the company was making these claims about doubt and uncertainty through at least the early 2010s, they were doing so in full awareness that their own science contradicted those claims,” Supran said. A 2017 peer-reviewed study, which Supran co-authored, examined nearly 190 public and private communications from the company and found that while the majority of internal documents acknowledged human-caused global warming, most of its public statements expressed doubt. Exxon rejected these findings at the time as “inaccurate and preposterous.” In 2021, a then Exxon lobbyist, Keith McCoy, was captured on an undercover video appearing to confirm that the company sought to undermine climate action. “Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes,” McCoy said in the video, filmed by Unearthed, Greenpeace UK’s investigative journalism arm. Exxon condemned McCoy’s statements at the time, saying that they did not reflect the company’s position on climate. The company, which made a record $58 billion in profits in 2022 according to preliminary data, has since expressed a commitment to the Paris climate agreement pledge to keep global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. It has also committed to reach net-zero emissions for its operated assets by 2050 – meaning it will remove from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as its operations emit. “ExxonMobil is actively engaged in efforts to reduce emissions while providing affordable energy to the communities that need it,” Spitler said. Exxon was one of the companies highlighted in a year-long investigation in the US by the Democratic-led House Oversight Committee into climate disinformation from fossil fuel companies, published in December. It found that the industry is “posturing on climate issues while avoiding real commitments.” At the time, Spitler issued a statement saying the committee took internal Exxon communications out of context, saying they represented “well intended, internal policy debates.” The report’s findings could potentially help support climate litigation against Exxon, Daniel Farber, professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN. (According to the study’s disclosures, one of the authors had previously served as a paid consultant to a law firm that has filed legal complaints against Exxon and other fossil fuel companies, though that law firm “played no role in this or any other study by the authors,” including in their funding.) Cities, counties and states across the United States have filed lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, accusing them of deceiving the public about their role in accelerating climate change. Exxon has said these lawsuits have no merit. “The more we learn about industry deception, the stronger the legal claims will be,” he said. Thursday’s analysis could also alter public perceptions of the company, Farber said: “Over time the company’s image may erode as the stream of disclosures eats away at its reputation.” This story has been updated to note the study’s competing interests disclosure. CNN’s Matt Egan and René Marsh contributed reporting."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Twin reports released Thursday by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found the last nine years were the hottest nine on record, with 2022 being the warmest La Niña year ever recorded. That’s significant, scientists said, since the La Niña phenomenon typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures. NASA also reported that 2022 was the fifth-warmest year on record for the entire planet, echoing similar findings from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which CNN reported earlier this week. “In the pattern of climate change, the long-term trends, we’re seeing this overall warming pretty much everywhere, with perhaps an exception in the deepest southern oceans around Antarctica,” Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist at NASA, told CNN. “And unfortunately, we’re predicting that 2023 will actually be warmer than 2022,” he said. Planet-warming fossil fuel emissions have pushed the planet’s average temperature to 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is nearly 75% of the way to the 1.5-degree threshold scientists warn it should stay under. These aren’t small numbers, Schmidt said. Even at 1.1 degrees, 2022 made abundantly clear the dangers of a warming planet that many are not prepared for, including a deadly heat wave that seared much of Europe, catastrophic flooding in Pakistan, a devastating hurricane in Florida, and historic droughts that are draining freshwater supply in many parts of the globe. “What we’re predicting – if we were to burn all the fossil fuels that we can – it could get as warm, by the end of the century, as the Ice Age was cold,” Schmidt said. The NOAA analysis also noted that ocean temperatures were at a record high in 2022, surpassing the previous record set in 2021. The last four years have been the warmest four on record for the planet’s oceans. Additionally, researchers found that the extent of Antarctic sea ice was at a near-record low in 2022, second only to 1987 with a smaller annual sea ice extent – an alarming development that threatens the region’s plants and animals, including its iconic penguins. From slashing the use of fossil fuels to retrofitting buildings to be more climate-efficient, Schmidt said the world already has the proper tools in place to address the worst of the climate crisis. It’s just a matter of using them fast enough. “It’s clear that people are taking this more seriously than they were a decade ago,” he said. “But let’s not sugarcoat how big a challenge this is. It’s not a challenge for a week or a year or a decade. It’s going to be the challenge of the century.”"

","Rachel Ramirez and Brandon Miller, CNN","For three years, California has been in desperate need of rain. Years of unfavorable precipitation trends and more intense heat waves have fed directly to the state’s unrelenting, historic drought that has triggered dire water shortages. But the past several weeks of rain and snow have “significantly reduced” the state’s drought intensity, according the US Drought Monitor’s latest report. Extreme drought — the second-highest designation on the drought monitor scale — has nearly disappeared, according to the weekly analysis published Thursday. It is now confined to less than 1% of the state near the border with Oregon. Only two weeks ago, more than one-third of California was in this extreme drought category. The drought is not over for the state, however. Despite the epic rain and snow, more than 95% of California remains in moderate or severe drought, since moisture deficits have been baked into the landscape in some areas over the past three years. Richard Tinker, author of this week’s drought monitor at the Climate Prediction Center, said there’s still quite a large deficit to make up as a result of the prolonged drought. “These things always look very impressive when they happen — and this one certainly is impressive — but down the road, depending on how things go, they might not be quite the boon that you think that they are at the beginning,” Tinker told CNN. “But from a reservoir standpoint, we’d rather have it than not have it.” The recent storms have been replenishing the state’s water supply, according to the state Department of Water Resources. California’s two largest reservoirs — Shasta Lake and Lake Oroville — have seen steep climbs and are inching closer to their historical average during this time of the year, which officials say is a much-needed improvement after remaining at critically low levels in the past year. “Good news is that [the reservoirs] are off historic lows,” Michael Anderson, climatologist with the state’s Department of Water Resources told journalists Wednesday. “The challenge is that they still have a lot of recovery to make before they would be back to normal operating conditions — so something to be mindful of.” As of Wednesday, Shasta Lake is at 44% of its total capacity, up 11% from where it was around this time last year, but still short of its historical average of 72%. Further south, Lake Oroville is at 49% of its capacity and still short of its historical average at this time of the year of 90%. Statewide, officials say California’s reservoir storage is at roughly 84% of average as of Wednesday — and it continues to rise with the storms. Molly White, water operations manager for the State Water Project with the California Department of Water Resources, said they expect more significant increases in the coming days as more rain arrives. “There are a few reservoirs that are at or above normal, but considering the great deficit we’ve had across the state and many of our reservoirs, we still have a deficit to go,” White said. “And we are filling them as we see all these storms come through.” According to White, Lake Oroville storage levels are now higher than where they were in 2021 and 2022. Meanwhile, Shasta Lake storage has surpassed the level it was at during this time of the year last year. Shasta saw an increase of more than a quarter-million acre-feet in the last three days alone. (An acre-foot is the amount of water that would cover 1 acre of land a foot deep — roughly 326,000 gallons.) Since the beginning of the December storms, Shasta Lake storage has gained at least 400,000 acre-feet. Meanwhile, Lake Oroville has seen an increase in lake elevation of roughly 650,000 acre-feet — and White said current forecast of inflows for Oroville in the next 10 days shows an additional 400-500,000 acre feet. Standing at 215% of normal, the state’s snowpack gains so far this winter also have been “impressive,” Tinker said. The Southern Sierra Nevada, in particular, is at 257% of normal, a significant shift for an area hardest-hit by the drought. Snow monitors across the state have registered what’s considered a full seasonal snowpack, which is what is typically expected by April 1. “I would say even if things dry out, you’re not going to lose any ground really over the wet season,” Tinker said. “The snowpack has already been put there, so how effective that is at helping out reservoirs and stuff depends on how warm it is or the speed at which the snow is going to melt.” High-elevation snowpack serves as a natural reservoir that eases drought, storing water through the winter months and slowly releasing it through the spring melting season. Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada accounts for 30% of California’s fresh water supply in an average year, according to the Department of Water Resources. “We’d like that snow to stay there all the way to April 1, and maybe even grow a bit,” Anderson said. In 2021, Lake Oroville plunged to just 24% of total capacity, forcing a crucial California hydroelectric power plant to shut down for the first time since it opened in 1967. The lake’s water level sat well below boat ramps, and exposed intake pipes which usually sent water to power the dam. Oroville’s low reservoir levels at the time pushed water agencies relying on the state project to “only receive 5% of their requested supplies in 2022,” according to the Department of Water Resources. Those water agencies were urged to enact mandatory water use restrictions to make their available supplies last through the summer and fall. Expecting another dry year, that 5% allocation was initiated last December, as the storms approached. “We’re assessing and crunching the numbers on what these recent storms could do for the allocation,” White said. “At this point, we’re still below average in Oroville, although we’re gaining and it’s great to see that deficit gap slowly close.” Groundwater across the state is also being recharged from the barrage of storms. Some cities that rely on groundwater aquifers for residential and agriculture use are beginning to capture water surplus from reservoirs such as the Folsom reservoir to fill the wells. “I’d expect you’d see in a month or so, my gut feeling and I can’t say this for certain, you’ll see a pretty significant increase [in groundwater],” Tinker said. But still, he said, “It’s not as much as you think based on how extreme the conditions have been.” Southern California also faced major water shortages as a result of the drought. But with the recent storms, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power estimated that about 10.6 billion gallons of stormwater had been captured between October 1, 2022, and January 10, 2023. That’s enough water to fill 16,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. Citing the city’s water crisis, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement that the city has “set a goal to maximize on-site rainwater capture because that is the only way to sustain our city in the future.”"

Political leaders and representatives from more than 190 countries will congregate to discuss how to put the world on course to meet the Paris Climate Agreement ambition of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Announcing Al Jaber’s appointment, the UAE praised his climate credentials, including his position as the country’s climate change envoy and role as founder of the renewable energy company Masdar. “The UAE is approaching COP28 with a strong sense of responsibility and the highest possible level of ambition,” Al Jaber said in a statement. The UAE, a big oil producer, has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, meaning it would remove from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as it emits. Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed the appointment. “I am confident that Dr Sultan has both the standing and the capability to offer groundbreaking leadership for COP28,” he said in a statement. The appointment has caused a backlash among some climate groups, given the role fossil fuels play in driving climate change. Climate organizations have said at Al Jaber’s appointment would undermine the possibility of achieving ambitious climate pledges and some have called for Al Jaber to relinquish his oil industry job to take this post. The appointment raises questions about the credibility of the UAE’s COP28 presidency, said Tom Evans, a policy advisor at the European climate change think tank E3G. “At face value, the head of a national oil company is obviously facing a massive conflict of interest,” he told CNN. Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network International said in a statement: “[Al Jaber] cannot preside over a process that is tasked to address the climate crisis with such a conflict of interest, heading an industry that is responsible for the crisis itself.” She added: “If he does not step down as CEO [of Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation], it will be tantamount to a full scale capture of the UN climate talks by a petrostate national oil company and its associated fossil fuel lobbyists.” Last year’s COP27 ended with countries affirming the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but a proposal to phase out fossil fuels was blocked by countries including China and Saudi Arabia. Climate campaigners accused the fossil fuel industry of exercising outsized influence at the summit, which was attended by more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists. “For the summit hosts to be taken seriously as honest brokers for change, they need to go above and beyond to avoid a conflict of interest,” UK-based humanitarian group ActionAid said in a statement. “This is vital for the safety and protection of our planet. Unfortunately, COP28 looks like it is off to a bad start in that regard.” However, others have said Al Jaber’s appointment is not a surprise as he has been at the forefront of renewable energy advocacy in the region. “He was the CEO of Abu Dhabi’s clean energy vehicle, he is still chairman of Masdar and he recently took a stake in renewables and hydrogen business,” Robin Mills, CEO of Dubai-based energy consulting firm Qamar Energy, told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “So what we are seeing here is a well thought out and long-term strategy, and energy diversity which emphasizes climate compatibility.” Al Jaber, who is the first CEO to ever hold a COP presidency according to the UAE’s statement, said: “[COP28] will be a critical moment to mobilize political will to respond to what the science tells us will need to be achieved to remain on target and limit global warming to 1.5C by 2050.” CNN’s Celine Alkhaldi and Ivana Kottasová contributed reporting."

Impending climate change, overpopulation, political discord, conflict in Ukraine and threats of nuclear war all paint a bleak picture. But this week delivered some refreshingly good news: The World Meteorological Organization released a very hopeful report stating that humanity and all life on Earth dodged a bullet. The Montreal Protocol, an international agreement signed in 1987, regulated the consumption and production of almost 100 chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that created a hole in the ozone layer and endangered the planet’s entire ecosystem. More than three decades later, the use of CFCs has decreased by 99%, and the Earth’s ozone layer is on track to recover in the coming decades. This success gives some of us hope that we might employ a similar approach to mitigate today’s very pressing danger arising from climate change. In 1974, chemists Frank Rowland and Mario Molina found that carelessly recycled refrigerators and ordinary hair spray posed an existential threat to life on Earth. The coolant in refrigerators and the propellant in spray cans were made of CFCs that, when mixed in air, rose to the very top of the atmosphere. There, the CFCs underwent chemical interactions that destroyed the ozone. The layer of ozone gas high above the Earth’s surface acts as a shield against the most dangerous forms of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. UV radiation can be deadly to life – humans use it to sterilize water, kill unwanted pathogens in hospital operating rooms, and sanitize everything from toothbrushes to cell phones. If the ozone were to disappear, dangerous solar ultraviolet light would make it to the Earth’s surface. In humans and animals, it would cause melanoma and cataracts. In plants, it would affect the ability to grow and produce fruits and vegetables. Perhaps most dangerously, it would kill phytoplankton in the ocean. Given that phytoplankton is the foundation of marine food chains, much of the life in the ocean would also die. In the face of this threat, the international community took notice and, in 1987, signed the Montreal Protocol. The protocol, which established practical targets, regulated both the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances, gave states flexibility in how they would meet those goals and created a fund that provided financial and technical support for developing countries to comply with the agreement. Since then, scientists have been monitoring the size of the ozone hole, which is shrinking. The success of the Montreal Protocol shows that world leaders can address global, existential problems by working together toward a common goal. CFCs, of course, are not the only way humans have endangered the Earth’s ecosystems. Indeed, the emission of carbon dioxide now poses a much greater danger. By burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, humans are pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at a rate of over 35 billion tons per year. The increase in carbon dioxide concentration over the past few decades has raised it to levels not seen over the past million years. Carbon dioxide is called a “greenhouse gas,” because it acts like a greenhouse, trapping heat under it. This causes the surface of the Earth to heat up, leading to changes in the climate. Previously habitable places become drier or wetter. A hotter Earth leads to glaciers melting, rising sea levels and the flooding of low-lying coastal areas. Island nations like Kiribati could disappear altogether. These disruptive climate changes are having a significant impact on humanity, including droughts in the American West, with rampant wildfires and emptying reservoirs. More heat in the atmosphere is also causing  more intense and destructive hurricanes, with attendant damage to houses and businesses. Carbon emissions are not due to any one nation. While historically the main emitter was the US, today it is China, with the US, the European Union, India, Russia and Japan being other leaders in this unwelcome ranking. No one country can fix this problem. What is needed is international negotiation and agreement to move humanity to other sources of energy beyond fossil fuels. Certainly, the governments of the world have tried. In 2015, nearly 200 nations signed an accord signed in Paris, agreeing in principle to address the carbon dioxide emission problem. Under President Donald Trump, the US withdrew from the pact in 2020, although it rejoined in 2021 when President Joe Biden took office. However, speed bumps like these should not deter the nations of the world. We know the problem and we have shown that we can cooperate when there is an existential threat to civilization. The example of successful CFC mitigation provides a blueprint – at least in spirit – for humanity to work together for the better of us all. Carbon dioxide is an enormous danger to humanity and civilization. It is an international problem, requiring an international solution, and the success of the agreement banning CFCs gives us some hope that humanity will once again rise to the occasion."

","Nadeen Ebrahim and Mohammed Abdelbary, CNN","Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in today’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN’s three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here. This year’s COP28 climate summit is mired in controversy, held in one of the world’s biggest oil exporting nations – the United Arab Emirates – and headed by one of the most prominent faces in its oil industry. Environmental activists have cried foul, arguing that the climate debate has been hijacked by the fossil fuel lobby to protect the profit-maximizing agendas of petrostates. The UAE’s involvement has sparked a discussion  on whether there’s a place in the climate space for countries that rely primarily on fossil fuel exports for their income. And opinions are split. Sultan Al Jaber, who will preside over the November summit, wears two very prominent hats in the UAE. Aside from being the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), he is also the UAE’s climate envoy, tasked with spearheading its energy policy. He took on the climate portfolio over a decade before becoming a top oil executive, helping launch the state’s clean energy company Masdar in 2006 and bringing the International Renewable Energy Agency’s headquarters to Abu Dhabi in 2009. The message the UAE is sending is that both fossil fuels and renewable energy must be part of the global energy mix, and that one does not have to replace the other. It has argued that given the projected growth in global energy demand, both clean and dirty energy will be needed to power the world, and a hasty transition away from oil and gas could have a detrimental effect on the global economy. “Recent events have shown that unplugging the current energy system before we have built a sufficiently robust alternative puts both economic and climate progress at risk – and calls into question whether we can ensure a just transition that is equitable to all,” Al Jaber wrote last year in an opinion piece for Project Syndicate. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates a nearly 50% increase in global energy use by 2050, with oil and gas remaining the most-consumed sources of energy. Tom Evans, a policy adviser at the European climate change think tank E3G, told CNN that Al Jaber’s appointment raises questions about the credibility of the UAE’s COP28 presidency. “At face value, the head of a national oil company is obviously facing a massive conflict of interest,” he said. Al Jaber’s dual roles are what make him a “terrific choice,” US Climate Envoy John Kerry was cited as saying by the Associated Press on Monday. The company he leads “knows it needs to transition,” Kerry  said. Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Monday called the UAE’s hosting of the summit a “unique opportunity” at an environmental summit in Abu Dhabi. The UAE has the expertise “to get every sector, particularly those hard to abate, aligned with 1.5,” he said, referring to the climate goal to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. The UAE has touted the mantra of “maximum energy, minimum emissions,” saying that instead of phasing out fossil fuels, it will work on making their extraction cleaner, and reinvest its revenues into renewable energy in an effort to raise its share of the nation’s energy mix. The country is future-proofing its energy sector and will “celebrate” the last barrel of oil it exports, Al Jaber said at an energy summit in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. Over the past 15 years, the UAE has invested $40 billion in renewable energy and clean technology globally, according to the Atlantic Council think tank. Last year, it entered a pact with the United States to invest another $100 billion in clean energy. Al Jaber on Saturday called for a tripling of renewable energy output around the world and twice as much money for adaptation in the global south. But that’s not enough, climate experts say. “Fossil fuel profits are most certainly not powering investments in clean energy,” Assaad Razzouk, a clean energy analyst in Singapore, told CNN. “Just look at the spending of oil and gas companies and how that’s allocated,” Razzouk said. Companies like ADNOC and Saudi Arabia’s Aramco oil company need to stop investing in oil and gas and spend much more on renewables if they are serious about the transition to clean energy, he added. Global campaigner Corporate Accountability in November described the presence of oil lobbyists at climate summits as “a rise in the influence of the fossil fuel industry at the climate talks that are already rife with accusations of civil society censorship and corporate influence.” Climate experts say the UAE’s approach of expanding the use of renewables while continuing to extract fossil fuels defies its own commitments. COP28 didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment. “The Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26 in 2021 by all countries, including the UAE, calls for a cut of 45% in carbon emissions by 2030,” Mark Maslin, a professor working on climate change at University College London, told CNN. “This can only be achieved if there is no new investment in fossil fuels and the use of all fossil fuels is phased out as soon as possible.” “So it does not make any sense to invest in fossil fuels when the world needs to be net zero emissions before 2050,” he added. But the UAE is doing quite the opposite. One of the few producers in the OPEC oil cartel with the capacity to ramp up production on short notice, the UAE  has repeatedly called for more investment in the oil sector to meet global demand, and has embarked on a project to further increase its own capacity. In November, it brought forward its oil production expansion to 2027 instead of 2030, when it will be producing up to 5 million barrels per day (bpd) from about 4 million. The UAE’s approach has been pragmatic, said Amena Bakr, chief OPEC correspondent at Energy Intelligence, adding that Russia’s war on Ukraine led nations to prioritize energy security and realize that the world couldn’t do away with oil and gas so soon. “Renewable energy still cannot meet base-load energy demand – that’s a fact,” she told CNN. For Razzouk, the clean energy analyst, the conflict has “incontrovertibly shown the folly of relying on imported fossil fuels, and the national security risks this entailed.” Iran hangs British citizen on charges of espionage and corruption A dual British-Iranian citizen was hanged by Iran on charges of espionage and corruption, a state-affiliated media outlet reported Saturday, the latest in a string of executions carried out by a regime grappling with unprecedented protests across the country. Alireza Akbari was executed for crimes including “corruption on earth,” according to the Iranian judiciary-affiliated outlet Mizan. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “appalled by the execution.” Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Saturday afternoon that the British government planned to sanction Iran’s Prosecutor General to underline “our disgust at Alireza Akbari’s execution.” More than 80,000 turn out for Tel Aviv protest against Netanyahu government Despite pouring rain, tens of thousands of people protested in Tel Aviv Saturday night against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government’s proposed changes to the judicial system. Others took to the streets in Jerusalem for parallel protests. Attendees held signs comparing Netanyahu to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and saying Israel was turning into the likes of semi-democratic Hungary and theocratic Iran. Syria sets conditions for rapprochement with Turkey Syrian foreign minister Faisal Mekdad said on Saturday that Turkey would have to end its military presence in his country to achieve a full rapprochement, Reuters reported. “We cannot talk about resuming normal ties with Turkey without removing the occupation, without ending terrorism and returning the relations to the state that they were based on the first place,” he said after meeting his Iranian counterpart in Damascus. The UAE will invest $30 billion in South Korea, Reuters cited South Korea’s presidential office as saying on Sunday. The decision was announced as South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol met his UAE counterpart, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, in Abu Dhabi during a four-day visit. Yoon’s press secretary said the investment will be directed at nuclear power, defense, hydrogen and solar energy industries, among others. Saudi Arabia: #Naturalizing_children_of_female_citizens Saudis on Twitter have been discussing a change in the kingdom’s citizenship law that was misinterpreted by some as easing the process of naturalization for the children of Saudi women. In most Arab countries, only men can pass on citizenship to their children automatically, which women’s rights activists have campaigned for decades to change. In Saudi Arabia, the children of Saudi women married to foreigners don’t get Saudi citizenship at birth but have the right to apply for it after the age of 18 if they meet certain conditions. The change in the Saudi citizenship law last week moved the authority to grant citizenship from the interior minister to the prime minister, but didn’t change the rules to obtain citizenship. Some regional news outlets falsely reported that the changes eased the rules of naturalization, prompting the topic to trend on Twitter in Saudi Arabia, with many praising the move and others warning of the demographic imbalance it could cause. The inaccurate reporting however sparked a debate on the topic, with many calling on the government to allow women to pass on citizenship to their children at birth. “I support this move because I consider the Saudi woman to be equal to the Saudi man, with all the rights and obligations as those Saudi men who marry foreign women and naturalize their children,” Saudi writer Mohammed Alkhalid said in a video posted on Twitter. Oil rich Gulf Arab countries have very strict naturalization procedures. Of the six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council, four have a majority expatriate population, with citizens accounting for less than 20% of the population in countries like the United Arab Emirates and Qatar."

Big Oil peddled the big lie. And like the tobacco industry, those responsible must be held to account,” Guterres told the conference. It is unclear whether ExxonMobil has any representatives in Davos. None are on the official attendee list and the company did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement to CNN last week about the analysis, Todd Spitler, a spokesperson for the company, said: “ExxonMobil is committed to being part of the solution to climate change and the risks it poses,” and “those who talk about how ‘Exxon knew’ are wrong.” The World Economic Forum has made climate one of the themes of this year’s gathering in the Swiss mountain resort, with a number of panel discussions dedicated to topics such as energy transition and sustainability. But Guterres has warned that many businesses are setting up climate targets based on “dubious or murky” criteria. “This misleads consumers, investors and regulators with false narratives. It feeds a culture of climate misinformation and confusion. And it leaves the door wide open to greenwashing,” he said. A new report published on Tuesday by the campaign group Reclaim Finance revealed that dozens of banks and financial institutions with net zero pledges are still pouring money into fossil fuels. The report analyzed finance organizations that signed up to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero pact, agreeing to align their investments with the ambition of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees – a key agreement struck at the 2021 COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. Since signing, however, it found members have invested hundreds of billions into fossil fuels. Guterres called on companies to “put forward credible and transparent transition plans on how to achieve net zero,” by the end of 2023. As the Davos meeting continues, a group of international climate activists including Vanessa Nakate from Uganda, Greta Thunberg from Sweden, Helena Gualinga from Ecuador and Luisa Neubauer from Germany, have launched a “cease and desist” petition, calling on fossil fuel CEOs to “immediately stop opening any new oil, gas or coal extraction sites, and stop blocking the clean energy transition.” The petition has been signed by 800,000 people and counting."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","As humans fiddle with the planet’s thermostat, scientists are piecing together Greenland’s history by drilling ice cores to analyze how the climate crisis has impacted the island country over the years. The further down they drilled, the further they went back in time, allowing them to separate which temperature fluctuations were natural and which were human-caused. After years of research on the Greenland ice sheet – which CNN visited when the cores were drilled – scientists reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that temperatures there have been the warmest in at least the last 1,000 years – the longest amount of time their ice cores could be analyzed to. And they found that between 2001 and 2011, it was on average 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than it was during the 20th century. The report’s authors said human-caused climate change played a significant role in the dramatic rise in temperatures in the critical Arctic region, where melting ice has a considerable global impact. “Greenland is the largest contributor currently to sea level rise,” Maria Hörhold, lead author of the study and a glaciologist with the Alfred Wegener Institute, told CNN. “And if we keep on going with the carbon emissions as we do right now, then by 2100, Greenland will have contributed up to 50 centimeters to sea level rise and this will affect millions of people who live in coastal areas.” Weather stations along the edge of the Greenland ice sheet have detected that its coastal regions are warming, but scientists’ understanding of the effects of rising temperatures there had been limited due to the lack of long-term observations. Understanding the past, Hörhold said, is important to prepare for future consequences. “If you want to state something is global warming, you need to know what the natural variation was before humans actually interacted with the atmosphere,” she said. “For that, you have to go to the past – to the pre-industrial era – when humans have not been emitting [carbon dioxide] into the atmosphere.” During pre-industrial times, there were no weather stations in Greenland that gathered temperature data like today. That’s why the scientists relied on paleoclimate data, such as ice cores, to study the region’s warming patterns.  The last robust ice core analysis in Greenland ended in 1995, and that data didn’t detect warming despite climate change already being apparent elsewhere, Hörhold said. “With this extension to 2011, we can show that, ‘Well, there is actually warming,’” she added. “The warming trend has been there since 1800, but we had the strong natural variability that has been hiding this warming.” Before humans began belching fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere, temperatures near 32 degrees Fahrenheit in Greenland were unheard of. But recent research shows that the Arctic region has been warming four times faster than the rest of the planet. Significant warming in Greenland’s ice sheet is nearing a tipping point, scientists say, which could trigger catastrophic melting. Greenland holds enough ice that if it all melted, it could lift global sea levels by roughly 24 feet, according to NASA. Although the study only covered temperatures through 2011, Greenland has seen extreme events since then. In 2019, an unexpectedly hot spring and a July heat wave caused almost the entire ice sheet’s surface to begin melting, shedding roughly 532 billion tons of ice into the sea. Global sea level would rise by 1.5 millimeters as a result, scientists reported afterward. Then in 2021, rain fell at the summit of Greenland – roughly two miles above sea level – for the first time on record. The warm air then fueled an extreme rain event, dumping 7 billion tons of water on the ice sheet, enough to fill the Reflecting Pool at Washington, DC’s National Mall nearly 250,000 times. With these extreme events in Greenland happening more often, Hörhold said the team will continue to monitor the changes. “Every degree matters,” Hörhold said. “At one point, we will go back to Greenland and we will keep on extending those records.”"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Climate change is sending the world hurtling towards a series of catastrophic tipping points, which risk setting off feedback loops that lock the world into irreversible climate change. That’s the bad news. The good news, however, is that there is also a series of “positive tipping points,” according to an analysis published Thursday by researchers from an international group of institutions including the University of Exeter and the World Resources Institute’s Systems Change Lab, with support from the Bezos Earth Fund. These are defined as small climate actions that could have a snowball effect, prompting emissions cuts across some of most polluting sectors of the global economy. The theory goes like this: As new technologies start to outpace older, more polluting versions, reinforcing feedback loops kick in that help a technology to improve, get cheaper and become more accessible. The idea is to create “​​self-propelling change,” Tim Lenton, Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter and a report author, told CNN. The report authors acknowledge that triggering these tipping points alone will not be enough to meet global climate objectives. But as time runs out to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, targeted action can be a powerful lever, they say. “In the face of an otherwise enormous climate and ecological crisis… maybe we can be part of change that will happen faster than we think,” Lenton said. The report identifies three “super-leverage points”: Relatively low-cost or low-difficulty interventions that could have the biggest impacts in decarbonizing the global economy. A tipping point is already “very close” for electric vehicles, the report says. EVs made up 10% of all cars sold last year, driven by sales in China and Europe. To be on track for a net-zero fleet by 2050, EVs must account for around 60% of new passenger car sales by 2060, according to the report, which says mandates for EV sales could be a “particularly powerful policy” to bring forward a tipping point. As demand ramps up, costs of production go down, including for lithium batteries, which have seen costs fall by 90% over the last 10 years, according to the report. EVs overtaking gas-powered cars could also have positive spillover benefits for other sectors requiring battery storage, such as wind and solar. “Electrifying cars means a tipping point for ever cheaper batteries, and cheaper batteries could be a really valuable, cheap source of storage of electricity to enable the transition to renewable power,” said Lenton. Meat has a huge climate impact. Livestock farming accounts for 14.5% of human-caused, planet-warming emissions. Plant-based proteins – things like beans, lentils, peas and nuts – produce up to 90% fewer emissions than meat. They are also catching up with meat in terms of cost, as well as flavor. But they currently have a low market share. If public institutions such as schools, hospitals and governments used their purchasing power to buy plant-based proteins instead of meat, this could be a “powerful lever to increase uptake of these products,” the report authors said. This policy change could also help shift social norms around plant-based products and increase their appeal, Lenton said. Moving away from animal products would have the added advantages of cutting farming emissions, freeing up land to support wildlife and carbon storage, and reducing incentives for deforestation. Ramping up the production of “green fertilizer” could not only slash emissions from the production of agricultural fertilizer, but also help kickstart a green hydrogen economy, according to the report. Ammonia, a key ingredient in commercial fertilizer, is currently produced using fossil fuels and accounts for about 1.8% of global carbon emissions. But it could be replaced by green ammonia, which is produced with green hydrogen using renewable energy. While currently more expensive than conventional ammonia, green ammonia is projected to be economically viable within the decade, according to the report, which suggests mandates for 25% of ammonia to be green would help reduce food system emissions as well as speed up the growth of the green hydrogen sector. Green hydrogen is a much-hyped climate solution because of its potential to replace fossil fuels in incredibly energy-intensive industries, such as shipping, steelmaking and aviation."

But whether it will be enough to help lift the West out of its multi-year water crisis, experts say, depends on temperatures in the coming months. Andrew Schwartz, lead scientist at the University of California, Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab, has been shoveling huge piles of snow at the lab site. The amount of snow the lab has received has been so excessive that it reached the second floor of their building, which they’ve since boarded up with plywood, he said. The snow’s been “very exciting,” Schwartz said, and he is “cautiously optimistic” that it will go far to alleviate reservoir concerns this year, at least in California. Across Western states, snowpack has reached more than 200% of normal levels in some places, with record-high amounts in the central Sierra Nevada. What’s already fallen there in the first couple of months of winter is what the region usually sees all the way through April 1. But nearly 60% of the West is still in some level of drought. And as the rain and snow subsided earlier this week, experts now worry how long that white gold will last as conditions get hotter and drier. “The numbers have been big, but we are still concerned that if we hit a prolonged dry and warm period, we may not end up in a spot that’s favorable come March and April,” Schwartz told CNN. “So cautious optimism is what we’re looking at, as water measurers and managers, because it’s been absolutely terrific so far. But we still have several months to get through in the water season.” “These aren’t static numbers,” he added. “They can easily drop if we see record high temperatures.” The West’s high-elevation snow is a natural reservoir, storing water throughout the cold winter months that then slowly trickles down into rivers and lakes in the spring and summer. But if temperatures start to warm before spring, that melting can start too early. Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is critical, because it accounts for 30% of California’s freshwater supply in an average year, according to the California Department of Water Resources. The drying Colorado River Basin, which supplies water to roughly 40 million people in seven Western states and Mexico, also relies on snow-capped mountain ranges in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah for replenishment. But with human-caused climate change transforming weather patterns around the world, cranking up temperatures and making droughts more severe and frequent, less water is flowing into rivers. Record-low water levels in the nation’s two largest reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell – have triggered mandatory water cuts for some Western states in the last year. Schwartz said snowpack in parts of the Colorado River Basin is running above average. But he also said the region is going to need a lot more to make up for a yearslong deficit. “The entire Western US snowpack is looking quite good right now,” Schwartz said. “Will it be enough to fill up Lake Mead or some of these other places that have been decimated? Likely not.” So far, Lake Mead’s water levels have risen by a few feet, though Lake Powell has yet to see an increase. California’s recent storms significantly improved the surface drought there. It was only two weeks ago that nearly seven million Californians lived in areas of extreme drought – the second-worst designation. That number has since dropped to zero. But Californians have seen this script before, and they know the pendulum can swing back hard the other way. Just last January, the population in the state under extreme drought fell from over six million to under 20,000 after an extremely wet December. But that didn’t last long – by May, more than 14 million were in extreme drought, nearly half the state’s population. This year’s record-breaking, three-week deluge helped replenish some smaller reservoirs, bringing them back to historical averages, but many of the larger reservoirs – like Shasta Lake and Lake Oroville – remain below average for this time of the year. “While precipitation over much of the state was over 300% of normal over the previous two weeks, deficits have been years in the making,” Deborah Bathke with the National Drought Mitigation Center wrote in Thursday’s drought report. “Historically, long-term drought is interrupted by a period of abnormally wet weather. However, it’s too early to tell if the wet weather is enough to end the drought.” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said one thing that would concern him is if the West sees a series of warmer storms in the next couple months. One of the signatures of a warming climate, he said, is that storms in the region are becoming increasingly warmer, bringing rain instead of snow to higher elevations. “That could be a problem because we do have such an enormous snowpack right now,” Swain told CNN. “Although right now, for the next two weeks, there is absolutely no indication of that at least, so that’s good.” Beyond reservoirs, soil moisture has also been high, which is good for groundwater aquifers. But Swain said this moisture will not significantly alleviate the yearslong groundwater overdraft from the megadrought. “This is not nearly enough, partly because it’s a supply and demand problem. We still got a lot of straws in the ground,” Swain said. “But you’d need multiple years like this in a row to really move the needle on recharging those aquifers. There’s probably some recharge going on right now, but it’s unlikely to be the very large amount that would be needed to really make a big difference there.” Climate experts have long said that it’s a lack of precipitation, higher temperatures, and an increase in evaporative demand – also known as the “thirst of the atmosphere” – that has pushed the West’s drought into historic territory. Swain warned that “thirstiness of the atmosphere” may likely be higher than it used to be, despite this wet year. “Once things clear out and dry out,” he said, “the atmosphere is going to pull a lot of that water back out of the landscape faster than it used to.” CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller contributed to this report."

","Haley Brink, CNN Meteorologist","Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. While the western US has been piling up snowfall over the past several weeks, it has been the complete opposite across the Northeast and New England. We are more than halfway through meteorological winter, which runs from December through February, and cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC have yet to see measurable snow, defined as at least 0.1 inches. And it’s not just the coastal cities. Many locations across interior New England and the Northeast are seeing significantly below normal snowfall to date. “With the exception of some areas downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario, and very small areas of interior New England, the East is certainly in a snow drought with some locations that normally have snow, down by as much as one to more than three feet,” the Weather Prediction Center Branch Chief Greg Carbin told CNN. Buffalo, New York was inundated with several feet of heavy snowfall earlier this winter. Carbin went on to explain there are two types of snow drought: “Along the I-95 corridor from DC to Boston, the latter type of snow drought has been measured so far this winter,” Carbin said. “Precipitation amounts have been normal to slightly above normal, but it’s generally been too warm for precipitation to fall in the form of snow.” The period between snow events is likely to increase as the climate warms, and it may be especially true for coastal Northeastern cities. As the Northeast temperatures warm, the rain-snow line shifts farther north, leading to more rainy winter day along the coast and less snow, according to the US National Climate Assessment. And it’s not just the Northeast, winter (December, January, February) is also the fastest-warming season for 75% of 238 US locations, according to Climate Central’s data analysis. 319 Central Park in New York City has gone 319 days without measurable snow through Sunday, which currently ties for their third-longest streak. Central Park would have to be snowless through February 5, 2023, to break the record streak of 332 days set back in 2020. 316 Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington DC have all gone 316 days without measurable snow through Sunday, which rank 6th, 12th, and 19th respectively. 1973 Central Park is also approaching the latest date in the season for their first measurable snowfall since record keeping began in 1869. “The current record is Jan. 29, 1973, which went on to become the least-snowy winter in NYC history, with just 2.8 inches total snow accumulation,” Carbin said. “The pattern has been fairly consistent with the typical La Nina pattern across the Northeastern US so far this winter,” meaning the track of the storms and cold air have remained to the north and west of the Northeast, meteorologists at the National Weather Service office in New York City told CNN. Watch: Meteorologist Jennifer Gray explains the effects of La Niña La Niña, the counterpart of El Niño, is characterized by below-normal sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, a result of shifting wind patterns in the atmosphere, which has a direct effect on weather seen across the US in the winter. “There are of course variations in this pattern due to short term factors that are not predictable more than one to two weeks in advance, such as the arctic outbreak during Christmas,” the weather service office in New York City said. “But these variations have been brief.” The most active weather and heaviest snowfall in recent weeks have been focused across the West and California, where more than 15 feet of snow have fallen across portions of the Sierras from December 26, 2022, through January 17, 2023. “While the jet stream meanders and can occasionally quickly change to support snowstorms just about anywhere during the winter, this winter has been quite active across the West, with a weak but broad area of high pressure (and warmer than average temperatures) over the eastern 2/3rds of the contiguous United States,” Carbin said. There is a chance Central Park could see some light accumulating snow Wednesday but there is still some uncertainty in the forecast, the weather service office in New York City said. If the city does not see snow this week, their streak will stay alive. After Wednesday, the weather service is currently forecasting dry conditions through January 29. “We need to make up the whole seasonal snowfall since none has accumulated, which is 29.8 inches,” the weather service office in New York City said. “The record storm total snowfall is 27.5 inches on January 22 to 24, 2016, so that is very close to our seasonal snowfall. All it may take is one storm to get us back on track.” While this scenario is certainly possible, it is not very likely. There have only been seven storms on record to dump 20 inches of snow or more across Central Park in recorded history, according to the weather service. “February and March are months in which big snows have fallen in the cities of the Northeast, so there remains some hope for snow lovers,” Carbin said. “Although, the later in the season you get started, the more likely you are to finish the season with lackluster snowfall.”"

But it is this very climate – where dry summers and wet winters provide the perfect conditions for tourism and agriculture – that’s also the state’s vulnerability. Everything could be dried out one year, then completely drenched the next. For years, historically dry conditions have pushed the West to uncharted territory, triggering never-before-seen water shortages. Then at the end of December and into the early weeks of January, an onslaught of rain and snow finally came, significantly reducing the severity of the drought. But Californians know the pendulum could abruptly swing the other way again: If moisture doesn’t stick around and heat sets in, experts worry the wintertime rain and snow could prime the landscape for an intense wildfire season. “The dangerous side to this could be – and we’ve seen this in the past – is we get all this moisture, which increases the amount of spring growth around the state, and then all that growth dries out after we no longer get more moisture and becomes just additional fuels,” Andrew Schwartz, lead scientist at the University of California, Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab, told CNN. More important than the amount of moisture in the ground right now is what’s there at the end of winter, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “What’s concerning is that now, in a warming climate, even in some of the wet years, we’re seeing significant or even elevated severe fire activity because of how dry and warm it gets in the intervening months,” Swain told CNN. While it’s too early to tell exactly, he added, the ingredients for a dangerous fire year are slowly coming together. It’s happened before. Issac Sanchez, CalFire’s battalion chief, said he recalls 2020 being an “unusual year,” with the season starting off with atmospheric river storms that dumped plenty of rain and snow and fueled vegetation growth across California. But those conditions quickly turned to drought, fueling record-breaking wildfires that burned more than 4 million acres – the worst wildfire season in state history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “We can’t say we’re going to get a lot of fires this year, because we simply don’t know,” Sanchez told CNN. “What we can point to is we can see that the conditions for large destructive fires are going to be there and we have to be prepared when that happens, because we don’t know when or where the fire is going to be.” California was slammed this winter with nine back-to-back atmospheric river storms, according to Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Those storms – conveyor belts of concentrated moisture in the atmosphere emerging from the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean – unleashed record rainfall, deadly flooding, debris flows and hurricane-force winds. In just three weeks, the storms brought an average of nearly 12 inches of rain – more than 32 trillion gallons of water – to the state. San Francisco saw nearly 18 inches in that three-week span, which is more than the city accumulated in the previous 12 months combined. High-elevation snowpack – which serves as a natural reservoir that eases the drought, storing water through the winter months and slowly releasing it through the spring melting season – now stands at more than 200% for this time of the year and is roughly equivalent to what the region sees at the end of the season, on April 1. “The numbers have been big, but we are still concerned that if we hit a prolonged dry and warm period, we may not end up in a spot that’s favorable come March and April,” Schwartz said. “We still have several months to get through in the water season, and these aren’t static numbers.” California’s winter storms significantly improved the state’s surface drought conditions. As of Thursday, nearly 90% of the state was in some level of drought. But it was only three weeks ago that nearly 7 million Californians lived in areas of extreme drought — the second-worst designation. That number has since dropped to zero. Climate researchers have said it’s the lack of precipitation, higher temperatures and an increase in evaporative demand – also known as the “thirst of the atmosphere” – that has pushed the West’s drought into historic territory. So these storms, experts say, were desperately needed. Schwartz said he wants moisture and the elevated snowpack to stick around to avoid an active fire season. The barrage of storms has also increased soil moisture, which is good for California’s severely parched vegetation. Moisture in plants and new growth help keep California wildfires at bay. April 1 is usually the time of the year when the state has the highest fuel moisture content. But that moisture needs to hold until then. Kurt Solander, a hydrologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, told CNN that storms could potentially have a strong impact on this year’s wildfires. It all depends on the moisture content of plants across the state during the late spring and early summer months. “It could be that the faucet providing the atmospheric rivers that we are seeing shuts off abruptly for the remainder of the winter,” Solander told CNN. The rain California has already seen “could promote the growth of [plant] fuels” that would increase the likelihood that areas which have burned in years past could burn again. If temperatures climb in the coming months, the sun could bake out what little moisture there is in the ground. Once all the vegetative fuel dries out, that’s when fire woes begin to emerge, said Lee Turin Dickman, a plant ecologist with the Los Alamos National Laboratory. “Even if it’s not particularly dry, if there are changes in the plant’s dry mass or carbon content, that can actually make the vegetation drier than you might expect based on weather or climate conditions,” she told CNN, referring to the phenomenon called the “spring dip” in which moisture content declines. The winter storms sparked some hope for drought-stricken California, but experts forecast another dry spell ahead as temperatures warm. “We see persistence of drought in Southern California as well as most of Nevada,” said Joe Casola, regional director for climate services in the Western region of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. “It doesn’t mean it’s not going to rain or snow in these places, it just won’t be enough necessarily in January, February, March and April to offset some of the drought conditions that we are still experiencing.” The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, for instance, is still under a regional drought emergency as it expects a fourth consecutive dry year. If dry and relatively warm conditions form over the coming months, Swain said that could substantially offset the gains that recent snow and rain storms brought in recent weeks. And dry conditions, in concert with low humidity and extreme heat, are a recipe for a destructive wildfire season. “If we have another summer punctuated by record heat – as we have pretty much every year for the past decade, at least somewhere in the West – then all of that extra vegetation still manages to dry out more or less completely,” Swain said. “So, by the end of the summer and the fall, the peak of the dry season, what you then have is a system full of extra vegetation that is just as dry as it would have been.” California is no stranger to life-threatening, landscape-altering fires. And scientists have showed that climate change is making them worse. In his research, Solander recently found that California was the only state where the rate of fire reburns, or areas burned multiple times over the years, has increased and was consistently higher than other areas of the West. “One of the primary drivers of wildfire re-burns in California was the moisture flux from plants during the late spring to early summer months,” Solander said, noting that he will have to go back and check the “moisture content of plants across the state during that time to better understand” how fires may play out later in the year."

But something unusual is happening this year: Gas prices are rocketing higher.                                             ","Matt Egan, CNN","Normally, prices at the gas pump drift lower during the dead of winter as lousy weather keeps Americans off the roads. But something unusual is happening this year: Gas prices are rocketing higher. The national average for regular gas jumped to $3.51 a gallon on Friday, according to AAA. Although that’s a far cry from the record of $5.02 a gallon last June, gas prices have increased by 12 cents in the past week and 41 cents in the past month. All told, the national average has climbed by more than 9% since the end of last year – the biggest increase to start a year since 2009, according to Bespoke Investment Group. AAA says some states have experienced much bigger gains over the past month, including Colorado (98 cents), Georgia (70 cents), Delaware (62 cents), Ohio (60 cents) and Florida (59 cents). The unusual wintertime jump in gas price is drawing eye rolls from American drivers already grappling with high prices at the supermarket. It also threatens to undermine improvements in the inflation crisis that gripped the economy much of last year. So, why are gas prices jumping? It’s not because of demand, which remains weak, even for this time of the year. Instead, the problem is supply. The extreme weather in much of the United States near the end of last year caused a series of outages at the refineries that produce the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel that keep the economy humming. For example, Colorado’s sole refinery, the Suncor refinery outside of Denver, was disrupted by freezing temperatures. When the refinery tried to restart, it suffered a fire and equipment got damaged. Suncor has indicated that refinery – which Lipow Oil Associates says represents 17% of the Rocky Mountain region’s refinery capacity – could be offline for at least weeks. That helps explain why gas prices in Colorado have surged by nearly $1 a gallon over the past month. Refineries elsewhere have been sidelined by extreme weather as well. US refineries are operating at just 86% of capacity, down from the mid-90% range at the start of December, according to Bespoke. Beyond the refinery problems, oil prices have crept higher, helping to drive prices at the pump northward. Since tumbling to $71.02 a barrel on December 9, US oil prices have jumped about 16%, to around $82.30 on Friday. That increase has been driven in part by expectations of higher worldwide demand as China relaxes its Covid-19 policies. At the same time, the oil markets are no longer receiving massive injections of emergency oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Biden administration has shifted from releasing unprecedented amounts of oil from that stockpile to beginning the process of refilling it. The good news is that some of the refinery problems may prove to be temporary, meaning supply should catch up with demand. The bad news is some experts are warning gas prices may keep going higher anyway. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, expects the national average will hit $3.65 a gallon heading into the spring. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, worries the typical springtime jump in prices will be pulled forward. “Instead of $4 a gallon happening in May, it could happen as early as March,” De Haan told CNN. “There is more upside risk than downside risk.” A return of $4 gas would be painful to drivers and could dent consumer confidence. Moreover, pain at the pump would complicate the inflation picture as the Federal Reserve debates whether to slow its interest rate hiking campaign. The Cleveland Fed’s Inflation Nowcasting model is now pointing to a 0.6% month-over-month increase for the Consumer Price Index for January. If that holds true, it would represent a significant acceleration compared with the 0.1% drop in prices between November and December."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Human activity and extreme drought is causing far more damage to the Amazon rainforest than previously thought, exacerbating climate change, according to a new study. While many climate studies focus on Amazon deforestation – where trees are completely cleared and land use changes – this study looks at “degradation.” This is when the rainforest becomes damaged and weakened, undermining its ability to store carbon and support nature and local communities. Up to 38% of remaining rainforest – an area of 2.5 million square kilometers, equivalent to 10 times the size of the UK – has been damaged by human activity and drought, according to the report. This is happening as some scientists warn the Amazon is approaching a critical tipping point, which could see the forest release huge amounts of carbon pollution and accelerate climate change. The report, published in the journal Science on Friday, was authored by an international team of 35 scientists and researchers from institutions including the University of Campinas in Brazil and Lancaster University in the UK, who analyzed satellite imagery and other data showing the changes in the rainforest between 2001 and 2018. They identified four main drivers of damage: forest fires, habitat fragmentation along edges where deforested areas meet forest, logging and extreme drought. “Despite uncertainty about the total effect of these disturbances, it is clear that their cumulative effect can be as important as deforestation for carbon emissions and biodiversity loss,” Jos Barlow, a professor of conservation science at Lancaster University and co-author of the paper, said in a statement. “It is a really significant contribution to the global climate,” he told CNN. The report found that degradation emits amounts of carbon pollution equivalent to or even greater than those from deforestation. As well as increasing carbon pollution, there is also evidence that degraded rainforest is less good at recycling water back into the atmosphere, which will then fall as rain somewhere else, Barlow said. These disturbances to the forest are likely to continue to be a major source of carbon pollution in the next two decades, according to projections made by the report. “Even in an optimistic scenario, when there is no more deforestation, the effects of climate change will see degradation of the forest continue, leading to further carbon emissions,” said David Lapola, a lead study author and researcher at the University of Campinas, in a statement. However, he added, “preventing the advance of deforestation remains vital” and could help tackle other drivers of deforestation. It could also help people who live in the forests. “The activities that drive degradation often provide benefits for a few wealthy actors who often live quite far away from that location … whereas the costs and burdens of degradation are borne mostly locally,” Barlow told CNN. Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading, who was not involved with the study, told CNN that the findings pointed to “a war of attrition from multiple sides that includes fire, timber extraction and severe drought.” “The Amazon is a custodian of biodiversity and possesses a vital ability to pull in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so it is clearly concerning that its health is deteriorating,” he added. Recently-elected Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has promised to tackle Amazon deforestation and repair the damage to the Amazon caused by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, under whose presidency deforestation surged. The report authors suggest a forest monitoring system to better understand rainforest degradation, as well as action to tackle illegal logging and control the use of fire. They also call for global action to combat climate change to help reduce the impact of extreme droughts."

Overnight lows will be downright frigid, resulting in wind chill advisories being issued for portions of Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas and Montana. “This would be the coldest weather since Christmas for this region, with locations from eastern Montana to northern Minnesota likely remaining below zero for highs Saturday through Monday, and perhaps into Tuesday,” the prediction center said. These temperatures may come as a shock to many since most of January has been so mild. Chicago and Kansas City are both running more than 9 degrees above normal for the month, and Minneapolis and Oklahoma City are running at least 6 degrees above normal for January. The dramatic shift from mild temperatures to bitter cold may catch people off guard. Bozeman, Montana, for example, will go from a high of 33 degrees on Friday to a high of -3 on Sunday – with more than 40 straight hours below zero. Minneapolis will see a high of 33 degrees Friday plummet to a high of 3 degrees Monday. St. Louis will remain milder on Saturday, with a high temperature of 56. On Sunday, however, the high will fall to 36 degrees and eventually reach a low of 16 degrees Monday night. Western cities will also witness dramatic drops. Denver will go from a high of 30 degrees on Saturday to a high of 7 degrees on Monday. Air temperatures are not the only concern this weekend. Across much of the High Plains and Midwest, winds will be gusting 20 to 30 mph. While that may not seem very high, it doesn’t take much for frostbite to set in when the air temperature is already so cold. “Wind chills could reach 40 below at times for these areas. Highs in the 0 to 10 degree range may extend as far south as northeast Colorado and northern Kansas,” the prediction center said. At that range, exposed areas of skin can experience frostbite in just 10 to 15 minutes. Another concern from that wind is its impact on snow storms. Blowing snow and reduced visibility will make travel difficult at times. “The upper level wave train has another snow maker for us this weekend,” said the National Weather Service office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. “There will be a good period of light to moderate snow for much of southern Wisconsin from midday Saturday through Saturday evening.” Winter conditions started to affect travel in parts of the Midwest on Friday. A portion of Interstate 39/90 between the cities of Beloit and Janesville in Wisconsin was shut down due to an 85-car pileup Friday afternoon, according to the WIsconsin State Patrol. At least 21 people were taken to area hospitals for non-life-threatening injuries, police said. From Saturday into Sunday, snow is expected to spread from the Cascades to the Rockies and into the Great Lakes region. Winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings are in place for over 18 million people. Generally speaking, in southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois and much of Iowa there will be 2 to 4 inches of snow, though these quick but intense snow burst events make it difficult to pinpoint who will see the highest snowfall amounts. “An additional narrow swath of 4-6” of snow, with locally higher totals, is forecast from northern Iowa through Lower Michigan by early Sunday,” the prediction center said. While snow will be predominant a little farther south, along the Iowa/Missouri border, according to the National Weather Service office in Des Moines, the office warns that it will be possible to see “a brief period of freezing drizzle and very light glazing of ice Saturday afternoon.” Snow will also fall this weekend across the Intermountain West. Most areas of Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Colorado and northern Utah will see light to moderate snow through Monday. However, the heaviest snow will occur in the higher elevations of Wyoming and Colorado where multiple feet of snow are possible. CNN’s Rebekah Riess contributed to this report."

That’s thanks to a combination of lower energy prices and a milder-than-expected winter. That’s the good news. The bad news is that it will still cost way more to keep warm than it did last winter. That’s driving a surge in the number of people applying for federal heating assistance — but not everyone will be able to get the help they need, as there’s less federal funding to distribute this year. Home heating this winter will cost an average of $1,162 across all fuel types, according to EIA’s January projection of total average costs for the season. That’s down $46 from the agency’s October forecast. The change, however, varies widely by fuel. Those who heat with natural gas will pay an estimated $828 over the course of the winter, down $103 from the initial forecast. Heating with oil will cost an estimated $2,342 for the season, down $12 from the October forecast. But that’s actually a bigger decrease than it seems because the EIA hiked its projection by several hundred dollars in November amid a spike in oil prices that has since receded. Those with electric heat will pay about the same amount, roughly $1,360, while those who heat with propane will pay an estimated $1,727, up $59 from the earlier projection. Still, costs are up across the board compared to last winter — nearly 26% and 14.5% for heating oil and natural gas, respectively, and 10.5% and nearly 9% for electricity and propane, respectively. “You’re still paying more, but not as much more,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. “If the warming trend continues, then it will be cheaper because you just don’t need to use as much fuel.” All the price fluctuations have made for a tough winter for home heating oil delivery companies, which are usually small, multi-generational family businesses. They have had to work with their banks to increase their lines of credit to purchase inventory and with their customers to put them on budget plans so they can better afford deliveries. More people have had to go on budget plans this year, and they are taking longer to pay their bills, said Sean Cota, CEO of the National Energy & Fuels Institute, a trade association for independent oil heat, propane, biofuel and motor fuel dealers and associated companies. “For the retail industry, it probably was and continues to be the most challenging year in our history,” Cota said of the “crazy differences” in prices each month. “The only good part has been that it’s been warm because of the tight supply — which is also bad for us, right? Because we need to sell stuff to stay in business.” For Jason Bell, the milder winter — plus a move to a rental house that heats with natural gas instead of electricity — has meant that he and his husband, Shane, can save more money to buy their own home. So far, they received a monthly bill of about $130 for electricity and $236 for natural gas. That compares to the roughly $470 monthly budget plan they were on in their old place, which also cost $200 more a month in rent. The savings, as well as the general decline in inflation in recent months, means that Bell can drop one of his two full-time jobs later this year. “We were hoping that in conjunction with the warmer temperatures and us turning the thermostat down at night that the heating bill would be a lot less,” said Bell, who is a police officer in a nearby borough and a state dog warden. “It offers a lot more breathing room.” Despite the estimated dip in costs, many Americans are in need of help. Applications for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program are projected to reach their highest level in more a decade, Wolfe said. Already, it’s up by as many as 1.3 million applications, the largest one-year increase since 2009. That’s on top of last year’s estimated 4.9 million beneficiaries. To help its residents cope with the high heating costs, Maine started sending $450 energy relief payments on Monday. An estimated 880,000 people will receive the assistance, which will be sent to individuals with incomes below $100,000 and couples filing joint returns making twice that. Each spouse will get the $450 payment. In Connecticut, applications have jumped 23% so far this season, which started in September, said Peter Hadler, the state’s LIHEAP director. That’s on top of a 27% increase over the same period a year ago. He said his staff is hearing from people dealing with multiple financial challenges, including higher prices for energy and food and the elimination of pandemic supplements, such as the enhanced child tax credit and three rounds of stimulus checks. The agency itself is contending with a triple whammy: more applications, higher fuel costs and less federal funding. Last January, it paid around $3.15 a gallon for oil for fuel delivery. Now, it’s around $4.10 a gallon, though at least that’s down from the roughly $5.70 a gallon in November. Hadler expects to receive $118.5 million in federal LIHEAP funds for fiscal year 2023, down from $140.5 million the prior fiscal year, when Congress poured billions more into the federal program through the American Rescue Plan Act. Last season, the federal appropriation for LIHEAP totaled a record of about $8.4 billion, while this fiscal year, it’s about $6.1 billion. If the federal funds run out, the state has promised to pitch in $30 million. Still, Connecticut has had to reduce the amount of assistance it can grant each household. For instance, last year the lowest-income vulnerable families — who had senior citizens, young children or disabled members — could receive up to $4,825 in fuel deliveries. This season, they can get only a maximum of $2,320. “We’re hearing from seniors and other applicants concerned about their ability to heat their homes,” Hadler said. “They’re keenly aware of the decline in benefits compared to last year. It’s small comfort for them to know that it is due to less federal funding. The bottom line is the benefits are smaller.”"

But economists are more optimistic than they were just a few months ago.                                             ,"Julia Horowitz, CNN","The global economy will weaken this year as rising interest rates and Russia’s war in Ukraine continue to weigh on activity. But economists are more optimistic than they were just a few months ago. The International Monetary Fund said Monday that it now expects global growth will slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2023. That’s up from a forecast of 2.7% in October. The upgrade in the outlook reflects China’s “sudden reopening,” which the IMF said “paves the way for a rapid rebound in activity.” It also cited unexpected resilience in numerous economies in the second half of 2022, as well as an improvement in global financial conditions as inflation starts to ease and the US dollar comes down from its highs. Official data published Tuesday showed that Europe’s economy managed to eke out growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. GDP growth across the countries using the euro currency was 0.1% compared with the third quarter of the year, easing fears of a recession. The annual rate of growth for 2022 was 3.5%, according to the preliminary estimate, stronger than the United States or China. “The outlook is less gloomy than in our October forecast, and could represent a turning point, with growth bottoming out and inflation declining,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s director of research, wrote in a blog post. The IMF emphasized that growth this year “will remain weak by historical standards.” (Between 2000 and 2019, the annual average was 3.8%.) Central banks will need to continue their aggressive campaign to reduce decades-high inflation, which will result in a slowdown of economic activity. It predicted that “nine out of ten advanced economies will likely decelerate.” In the United States, growth is expected to slow from 2% in 2022 to 1.4% in 2023. Europe — whose economy has proved surprisingly hardy despite the region’s energy crisis, in part due to a mild winter so far — is forecast to see growth among the 20 countries that use the euro drop from 3.5% to 0.7%. The United Kingdom is expected to experience a contraction of 0.6%. It’s the only Group of Seven economy projected to shrink this year. A closely-watched survey of executives published last week showed the steepest decline in business activity since the national Covid lockdown two years ago. Higher interest rates and low consumer confidence are depressing activity in the dominant services sector, while the public sector has been hit by the worst wave of strikes in decades. Still, the IMF sees some improvements to the global outlook. A major reason is China. Beijing ended its strict “zero Covid” policy late last year, reopening its borders and moving away from the harsh quarantine and testing policies that had held back growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Its 3% expansion in 2022 was one of the country’s worst performances in decades. The IMF now forecasts growth in China will rebound to 5.2% this year, notably higher than its previous estimate. Inflation trends are also promising. The IMF noted that “overall measures [are] now decreasing in most countries,” even if price increases for goods and services excluding food and energy have yet to peak in many cases. The headline annual reading of US inflation reached a high in June, while inflation in Europe has fallen since October, when it touched a record. Global inflation is forecast by the IMF to ease from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024. Before the pandemic, it was near 3.5%. A pullback in the strength of the US dollar since November, meanwhile, has been helpful for emerging market and developing economies. The greenback’s steep rally had made it more expensive to import commodities, including food and energy, and raised the cost of paying interest on some debt. Risks to the outlook remain substantial, the IMF warned. China’s recovery could lose steam if future coronavirus waves keep people at home or the vulnerable property sector slows sharply. Inflation could stay elevated for longer than central banks would like, mandating tighter monetary policy. The war in Ukraine remains a key source of uncertainty. An escalation could add to disruptions in food and energy markets. For now, though, it’s feeling slightly better about the next 12 months — while stressing that they won’t be easy. “This time around, the global economic outlook hasn’t worsened,” Gourinchas wrote. “That’s good news, but not enough. The road back to a full recovery, with sustainable growth, stable prices and progress for all, is only starting.”"

Additionally, low to moderate chances for three-day ice accretion over a half inch exists over parts of central Texas and Arkansas,” the center said. Wintry precipitation will come in several waves across the region through Wednesday, and while there may be breaks in the active weather, roads will remain slick throughout the event as temperatures stay cold. Dangerously bitter cold air also settled in behind the arctic front as it slowly moved through the West over the weekend, with more than 15 million people under wind chill warnings Monday morning. Wind chills as low as 45 degrees below zero are possible. The coldest wind chills can cause frostbite in a little as 10 minutes. Here’s what to expect in the coming days: In Austin, freezing rain could begin as early as Monday morning. Icing will be possible mainly late at night through mid-morning, when temperatures will be coldest. Dallas is also expected to see significant icing from one-tenth to a quarter of an inch. Snowfall up to an inch and ice around two-tenths of an inch are possible in Oklahoma City. Meanwhile, snow and sleet up to an inch and ice up to a tenth of an inch are possible in Springfield, Missouri, and ice accumulation up to a tenth of an inch in St. Louis. “The snow will result in reduced visibility and the snow/ice will produce hazardous driving conditions,” the weather service warned. The most significant travel impacts in the Texas area are expected Tuesday, with icy bridges and slick roadways possible, according to the weather service’s Fort Worth office. Drivers were asked to watch out for patches of black ice and slippery roadways. “Avoid travel if you can, but if you have to get out, watch out for ice/black ice, make sure to give yourself plenty of time and to slow down while driving,” the weather service said. In Oklahoma, deteriorating travel conditions were expected to begin Monday morning as sleet and freezing rain moved into the area, according to the weather service office in Norman. And as freezing drizzle spread into central Illinois Sunday evening, the weather service office in Lincoln warned that slick roadways, sidewalks and parking lots are possible. “Use caution if heading out tonight,” forecasters said. Poor weather may have been a factor in a deadly multi-vehicle crash in Carbon County, Wyoming, over the weekend. The crash on Interstate 80 left one person dead and injured several others Saturday evening as an arctic front was slowly moving through the area. While the exact cause of the collision it is not known, excessive blowing snow and winds kept visibility down when it happened – even at times when no new snow was falling. Areas along the I-80 saw between 1 and 5 inches of snow, with isolated areas along the highway seeing even higher accumulations. A total of 44 vehicles collided between two separate crashes on the interstate, the post stated. CNN’s Monica Garrett and Nouran Salahieh contributed to this report."

","Christian Edwards, CNN","The planet could cross critical global warming thresholds sooner than previous models have predicted, even with concerted global climate action, according to a new study using machine learning. The study estimates that the planet could reach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels in a decade, and found a “substantial possibility” of global temperature rises crossing the 2-degree threshold by mid-century, even with significant global efforts to bring down planet-warming pollution. Data shows average global temperature has already climbed risen around 1.1 to 1.2 degrees since industrialization. “Our results provide further evidence for high-impact climate change, over the next three decades,” noted the report, published on Monday in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, countries have pledged to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees – compared to pre-industrial levels. Scientists have identified 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages will increase dramatically. Temperature rises over 2 degrees could bring catastrophic and potentially irreversible impacts, including pushing three billion people into “chronic water scarcity.” The study used artificial neural networks – a type of machine learning or artificial intelligence – which scientists trained on climate models and then used historical observations of temperature around the world “as independent input from which the AI makes a prediction,” said Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor at Stanford University and a co-author on the study. Diffenbaugh and his co-author Elizabeth Barnes, a professor at Colorado State University, assessed three different scenarios: Low, medium and high “forcing” climate pathways, which refer to the intensity of the heating caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In all three scenarios, the scientists estimated that the world would hit 1.5 degrees of warming between 2033 and 2035, even if planet-warming pollution is substantially reduced. Diffenbaugh said that while “individual years are likely to reach 1.5 degrees sooner,” their predictions “are focused on how long until the global mean temperature was warmed 1.5 degrees.” The study’s prediction is in line with previous models. In a major report published in 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the world could cross the 1.5-degree threshold “in the early 2030s.” Where the study departs from many current projections is in its estimates of when the world will cross the 2-degree threshold. While the IPCC projects that in a low emissions scenario, global temperature rises are unlikely to hit 2 degrees by the end of the century, the study returned more concerning results. The AI predicted a probability of around 80% that 2 degrees warming will be reached before 2065, even if, over the next half century, the world reaches net-zero – where it removes at least as much planet-warming pollution from the atmosphere as it emits. If emissions stay high, Diffenbaugh said, the AI predicted a 50% probability that 2 degrees will be reached before 2050. There is “clear evidence that a half degree of global warming poses substantial risks for people and ecosystems. Hence, the greater the global warming, the greater the challenges for adaptation,” Diffenbaugh said. While many net zero decarbonization pledges and targets have been framed around holding global warming to 1.5 degrees, he added: “The AI predictions in our study suggest that those may be necessary to avoid 2 degrees.” The use of machine learning to make predictions is increasing in climate science, Diffenbaugh said. “The AI is able to learn the most reliable indicators of how long is left until a given global warming level is reached in a large number of sometimes contradictory climate model predictions.”"

In this swath of mountain range in the Washington Cascades, ...","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Nestled between the snowy ranges of Mount Rainier and Glacier Peak, a significant glacier in Washington state has disappeared after existing full of ice and snowpack for millennia, according to a researcher who has tracked the glacier for years. In this swath of mountain range in the Washington Cascades east of Seattle, the climate crisis dealt the final blow to the Hinman Glacier, the largest in the region, according to Mauri Pelto, a glaciologist with Nichols College. It’s not just the Northern Cascades that’s losing ice. Researchers recently found that up to half of the planet’s glaciers could be lost by the end of the century, even if the world’s ambitious global climate targets, including phasing out fossil fuels, are met. To paint a picture of Hinman’s retreat, experts say an unofficially named “Hinman Lake” has replaced the former glacier, which contains traces of relict ice masses. As the lake filled from glacier melt, it became harder for hikers to traverse this part of the mountain range. Pelto told CNN he has been visiting and observing Mount Hinman for 40 years. And in the summer of 2022, as temperatures soared and an unrelenting dry spell gripped the Northwest, Pelto led a team up the mountain only to see Hinman’s demise. “It’s completely disappeared. This was the biggest glacier in this part of the mountain range — it was exceptional,” Pelto told CNN. The glacier could reform, he said, “but as we continue to warm into the future that will be even less hospitable.” Roughly 50 miles east of Seattle, deep in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Hinman and its neighboring glaciers have been critical to the Pacific Northwest’s salmon population as well as other aquatic species. During the warmest and driest periods, Hinman fed the Skykomish River with a considerable amount of cool glacier runoff. But as the climate crisis advanced, the flow dropped significantly. This decline in summer streamflow from the glaciers and warming freshwater reduces the not only the salmons’ quality of life but also that of people who rely on the river, experts say. Since the 1950s, the primary glaciers that feed the Skykomish River basin have lost around 55% of their surface area. Last year, Pelto and his team measured that the Columbia Glacier declined in area by 25%, Foss by 70%, Lynch by 40% and Hinman by 95%. David Shean, professor of civil and environmental engineering who focuses on glaciers at the University of Washington, said he and collaborators with the US Geological Survey have been working to quantify the changes, including direct measurements of ice volume and mass change over time to tell the full story. As glaciers thin and retreat, he said, they can form stagnant ice patches in alcoves that are less susceptible to extreme temperatures. But these ice patches are often too thin to flow downhill, which is an important criteria for an ice mass to be classified as a “glacier.” Shean noted that not all of the lingering ice in those alcoves has yet vanished. But he also said “it may no longer technically qualify as a ‘glacier’ because it’s not flowing, and the residual ice will likely disappear completely in the coming decade or more.” Many glaciers were formed during the last Ice Age. And while glaciologists including Pelto aren’t sure how far back the Hinman Glacier was created, he found strong evidence that Hinman was older than Mount Mazama eruption, which created Oregon’s Crater Lake, 7,000 years ago. There’s still some hope, Pelto said. For a glacier to form and persist, it needs more average accumulation of snowfall. Hinman would need to see a bounty of above-average snowfall in the coming years for it to reform. But with the rate at which planet-warming pollution is accelerating, these icy landscapes as we know them may no longer be the same. “The rate of loss in the past few decades is higher than earlier during the 20th century,” Shean said, noting that smaller glaciers are particularly hard hit. “We’ve seen more ice loss in the past 50 to 70 years for the smaller, lower elevation glaciers in the Washington North Cascades, compared to the larger, higher elevation glaciers, like those on Mt. Rainier, for example.” Since Pelto started noticing the Hinman glacier’s decline in 2005, he decided he wanted to document it beyond science and bring in artists, including his daughter Jill, who can capture the changing landscape through painting. “I really feel like the loss of [glaciers] from the landscape does tap into people’s emotions, and art does that better than science data,” Pelto said. “And so I’ve tried to bring artists out every summer.”"

In the last few weeks, that’s produced a pair projects, Syfy’s “The Ark” and the Netflix movie “JUNG_E,” which begin from the premise that humans have so defiled Earth they need to venture out into space in order to find a new place to live. The idea certainly isn’t a new one, having provided the foundation for the 2008 Disney/Pixar movie “WALL-E,” in which a lonely robot was left behind while bloated people took refuge in space. These new productions use the threat of climate calamity to explore different themes and sci-fi motifs – in the case of “The Ark,” which comes from producer Dean Devlin (of “Independence Day” and “Stargate” renown), what amounts to a wagon train of pioneers on a space-faring vessel; and in the South Korean film, a contemplation of artificial intelligence through a mother-daughter relationship and a decades-long civil war involving outposts of survivors. Both fall somewhat flat, in separate ways. Set 100 years in the future, “The Ark” focuses on Ark One, the first of several massive ships dispatched into space, each seeking to establish colonies that can offer salvation to those left behind. The occupants of the craft, however, are awakened prematurely from their cryogenic sleep by an unknown accident that has killed most of the “mentor class,” forcing junior officers and more youthful personnel to try to save the mission and the crew of 150 survivors on board. Alas, that conceit results in a lot of young-adult-oriented flourishes that come across as particularly stilted, as if the “Star Trek” cadet class was put in charge amid pressing concerns about water, food and other rations that weren’t expected to be needed this early in the voyage. If this sort of series is only as good as its characters, “The Ark” is a poorly populated enterprise, not to be confused with the Enterprise. As for “JUNG_E,” the film turns out to be visually striking and narratively muddled, with a story that starts somewhere in the middle, throws around lots of provocative science-fiction concepts and comes to a rather abrupt end. The narrative opens with humanity embroiled in 40 years of civil war, after climate change has forced people to off-planet shelters that have declared war on each other. Seeking to end the conflict, a team of scientists is working to create an army of warriors based on a legendary soldier, Yun Jung-yi (Kim Hyun-joo), using her brain data in android hosts more than 30 years after her death. Adding an emotional hook, the project is spearheaded by the soldier’s now-grown daughter, Yun Seo-hyun (Kang Soo-youn, who died last year, shortly after completing work on the movie). Directed by Yeon Sang-ho (“Train to Busan”), “JUNG_E” devotes too much of its time to those research simulations, as the daughter and her team try to perfect the prototype. The importance of that plan feels hazy – that is, why the model in question is deemed a potential game-changer in the war – further confused by the machinations of the conglomerate behind it amid a conflict that has dragged on for decades. Perhaps inevitably, both “The Ark” and “JUNG_E” feel like mash-ups of previous sci-fi concepts. That includes the latter’s impressive design and look, which perhaps most closely resemble the Will Smith movie “I, Robot” in terms of the androids, with a pinch of “Blade Runner’s” grimy dystopia. Early pioneers sought better lives, so there are old-school underpinnings to the notion of venturing out among the stars – “The final frontier,” as Gene Roddenberry eloquently put it – as humanity pursues refuge. That becomes more sobering, of course, when people are forced to do so by their own failed stewardship of the planet. Yet while the concept is provocative, in science fiction it’s inevitably just a jumping-off point – and with these two projects, a start that leads to fairly forgettable journeys into the unknown. “The Ark” premieres February 1 at 10 p.m. ET on Syfy and Peacock. “JUNG_E” is available on Netflix."

It’s all connected.                                             ,"Laura Paddison, Krystina Shveda and Jhasua Razo, CNN","Even as the world smashes through one all-time heat record after another and speeds towards critical warming thresholds, brutal waves of deadly cold can still arrive in bomb cyclones that bring icy weather and deep snow – and add fuel for those who deny the climate crisis is real or significant. But some scientists say that climate change – and more specifically rapid warming in the Arctic – may actually be increasing the likelihood that frigid, polar air can dive south. Look no further than the heavily populated US Northeast this weekend to see a real-time example of the long-term warming trend being interrupted by tremendous, record-setting cold. Last month will be remembered for the winter-that-wasn’t in the region – ranking as the warmest January on record for nearly all Northeast cities. It was the first month in New York City that temperatures ranked above-average every single day, and first time the month ended without measurable snowfall in the city. But the weather pendulum swings hard to the other extreme this weekend when record warmth will become record cold, with dozens of low temperature milestones predicted. The wind chill is expected to plunge to dangerous levels of minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 34 Celsius) for millions on Saturday. So what’s going on? While winters are becoming warmer overall and warm records outpace cold, this January brought a brutal cold snap deep into parts of Asia. Temperatures in the city of Mohe in northern China plummeted to minus 53 degrees Celsius (minus 63.4 degrees Fahrenheit), the lowest temperature the country has ever recorded. Fierce cold and record amounts of heavy snow in Japan killed at least four people in what the country’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno called a “once-in-a-decade cold snap.” Low temperature records also fell in several places in South Korea. “Cold air from the North Pole has reached South Korea directly,” after traveling through Russia and China, Korea Meteorological Administration spokesperson Woo Jin-kyu told CNN. More than 150 people died in Afghanistan as temperatures reached lows of minus 28 degrees Celsius (minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit), in what has so far been one of the country’s harshest winters. And the world’s coldest city, Yakutsk in eastern Siberia, saw temperatures reach minus 62.7 degrees Celsius (minus 80.9 degrees Fahrenheit) – the lowest in more than two decades according to meteorologists. Extreme winter weather is now shifting to the US, with dangerously cold Arctic air pushing southwards, sweeping across many parts of the country and quickly dispensing with what had been a mild January. Our weather is intimately connected with the jet stream, a wavy river of fast-moving air high in the atmosphere, around the level at which airplanes fly. When the jet stream swings south, cold Arctic air can dive into the mid-latitudes along with it – the part of the Earth where the most people live in North America, Europe and Asia. That’s what happened in Asia in January, Judah Cohen, a climatologist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, told CNN. When the jet stream retreats north, warm air will also push further north. A big high-pressure swing over Europe in January led to record warm winter temperatures and and left some mountains bare of snow. There is also another factor to consider: The polar vortex. This is a belt of strong winds encircling blisteringly cold Arctic air, which sits extremely high in the stratosphere – above the level of the jet stream – around the North Pole. The polar vortex is like a spinning top, Cohen said. In its normal state, it rotates very fast, keeping the cold air close to the center, like an ice skater spinning quickly on the spot, arms neatly across their chest. But every now and then it gets disrupted. It’s as if the ice skater hits a crack in the ice and flies off course, arms flailing. The polar vortex wobbles, becoming stretched and distorted, spilling out cold air and influencing the path of the jet stream. The devastating cold spell that hit Texas in 2021, taking out power across much of the state and leading to more than 240 deaths, was caused by one of these stretching events, as was the historic cold that hit the US in late December. Some scientists say minor disruptions in the polar vortex may help explain the recent extreme cold in Asia. The theory centers on the Arctic, which is warming up to four times faster than the rest of the world as a result of heat-trapping pollution from burning fossil fuels. Some scientists argue that this warming is triggering changes to the jet stream and polar vortex, causing more frequent winter extremes. This idea gained traction following the publication of a 2012 study, co-authored by Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts. It suggested that Arctic warming was reducing the difference between the cold temperatures in the north and warm temperatures in the south, leading to a weaker, wavier jet stream, which pushed very cold air southwards. Francis’ paper kicked off a debate and, in the decade since, many more scientists have looked at the theory. One of the most prominent papers, co-authored by Cohen in 2021, said it found clear links between Arctic warming and disruptions to the polar vortex. Cohen’s argument is that particularly rapid heating in an area of the Arctic, north of western Russia, combined with increased snowfall in Siberia, amplifies the waviness of the jet stream and pushes energy upwards. This knocks the polar vortex off course, causing very cold air to spill out. The paper linked Arctic warming to extreme winter weather across parts of Asia and North America, including the prolonged cold wave in Texas in 2021. “We are not arguing that winters are getting colder overall,” Cohen said. The world is smashing through many more heat records than it is cold records. But the idea that climate change will mean fewer swings between extreme temperatures is “an oversimplification,” he said. “As we continue to dump greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and thicken this blanket of greenhouse gasses around the Earth, we will see more extreme events of all sorts, including these cold spells,” Francis told CNN. Not at all. This is a very complex area of research and other scientists are far more cautious. There have been a number of cold winters in the US and Asia coinciding with warm winters in the Arctic, James Screen, professor in climate science at Exeter University, told CNN. “The challenge we face is determining cause from effect.” Screen co-authored research which used climate models to predict what will happen when Arctic sea ice reduces even further. It found sea ice loss had only a very small effect on the jet stream and there was no real sign of an effect on the polar vortex. While the research pointed to warmer Arctic winters and bursts of cold further south, Screen said this can be “explained by normal weather variability.” In other words, even as winters warm, cold extremes will still occur – because that’s just how winters work. One key criticism of the research linking Arctic changes to severe winter weather is that it’s based on historical data. “If we look more at climate model data, we don’t see these types of links or they’re very weak,” Dim Coumou, a climate professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, told CNN. What scientists do agree on is the need to keep studying these extremely cold spells. “We don’t really have enough research yet,” Daniela Domeisen, a climate professor at ETH Zurich, in Switzerland, told CNN. “Eventually we’ll find a solution to this and actually understand the mechanism, but I just think we’re not there yet.” CNN’s Brandon Miller, Heather Chen, Yoonjung Seo, Paula Hancocks, Jake Kwon and Junko Ogura contributed reporting."

Scientists say that one, often overlooked, factor is playing a bigger role than previously thought: Atmospheric rivers.                                             ","Rachel Ramirez and Laura Paddison, CNN","The Arctic is seeing a rapid decline in sea ice even during the cold winter months when it should be recovering from the summer melt. Scientists say that one often-overlooked factor is playing a bigger role than previously thought: Atmospheric rivers. These long, narrow bands of moisture in the atmosphere transport warm air and water vapor from the tropics. They can extend for thousands of miles and dump rain and snow when they make landfall. In January, atmospheric rivers brought a parade of deadly storms that unleashed heavy rain, flooding and mudslides in California. Now they are increasingly reaching the Arctic, according to a study by a team led by Penn State University scientists and published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Using satellite observations and climate models, the scientists found that atmospheric rivers are reaching the Arctic more frequently during the winter season, especially over the Barents-Kara Seas, off the north coasts of Norway and Russia. The authors used satellite images to analyze sea ice immediately following the atmospheric river storms and discovered sea ice retreated for up to 10 days. In winter, temperatures in the Arctic are below freezing and the ice should be recovering. Instead these powerful storms are slowing down seasonal ice recovery. The storms can be blamed for a third of the Arctic’s wintertime sea ice loss, the scientists reported. “Arctic sea ice decline is among the most obvious evidence of global warming from the past several decades,” Pengfei Zhang, the study’s lead author and assistant research professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, said in a statement. “Despite temperatures in the Arctic being well below freezing, sea ice decline in winter is still very significant. And our research shows atmospheric rivers are one factor in understanding why.” Atmospheric rivers are inherently warmer than the surrounding Arctic environment and can act like a blanket, trapping heat near the Earth’s surface and preventing it from escaping out to space. Their heavy rainfall also has a melting effect, especially on fragile, re-growing ice. Climate change is amplifying the intensity of atmospheric rivers, scientists say, as a warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall when they make landfall. Using climate modeling, the study also found evidence that global warming is one factor in the increased rate of atmospheric river storms in the Arctic. The Arctic, which is warming up to four times faster than the rest of the planet, has undergone dramatic changes in recent decades. Last year, in its annual Arctic health checkup, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found it has become hotter, rainier and wetter, with a rapid decline in snow cover and unprecedented late season melting. This latest report on atmospheric rivers adds another layer of complexity to those findings. Marty Ralph, the director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, who was not involved in the research, said the study underscores the larger impact of atmospheric rivers. “It is clear that the future of Arctic sea ice hinges to a significant degree on the strength and frequency of occurrence of [atmospheric rivers],” Ralph told CNN. The loss of Arctic sea ice has significant consequences for the rest of the planet. The absence of reflective ice opens up the dark waters beneath, causing the ocean to absorb more heat, feeding into a cycle of melting and heating. The melting of freshwater into the ocean can also disrupt ocean circulation patterns, exacerbating global warming. “Sea ice melting has a big impact for the climate system and for society, and our study finds the Arctic is an open system and that climate change is way more complicated than temperature change alone can explain,” Laifang Li, co-author of the study and assistant professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at Penn State, said in a statement."

","Janelle Chavez, CNN","Climate change and antimicrobial resistance are two of the greatest threats to global health, according to a new report from the United Nations Environment Programme. The report, titled “Bracing for Superbugs,” highlights the role of climate change and other environmental factors contributing to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. It was announced Tuesday at the Sixth Meeting of the Global Leaders Group on Antimicrobial Resistance in Barbados. Antimicrobial resistance or AMR happens when germs such as bacteria, viruses and fungi develop the ability to defeat the medications designed to kill them. “The development and spread of AMR means that antimicrobials used to prevent and treat infections in humans, animals and plants might turn ineffective, with modern medicine no longer able to treat even mild infections,” the UN Environment Programme said in a news release. Roughly 5 million deaths worldwide were associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019, and the annual toll is expected to increase to 10 million by 2050 if steps aren’t taken to stop the spread of antimicrobial resistance, according to the report. In the US, there are nearly 3 million antimicrobial-resistant infections each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Antimicrobials are commonly used in cleaning products, plant pesticides and medications to kill and prevent the spread of germs among people, animals and crops. Drug resistance can develop naturally, but experts say the overuse of antimicrobials in people, animals and food production has accelerated the process. The microorganisms that survive these chemicals are stronger and more powerful, and they can spread their drug-resistant genes to germs that have never been exposed to antimicrobials. The focus so far has largely been on excessive antimicrobial use, but experts say there is growing evidence that environmental factors play a significant role in the development, transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistance. “Climate change, pollution, changes in our weather patterns, more rainfall, more closely packed, dense cities and urban areas – all of this facilitates the spread of antibiotic resistance. And I am certain that this is only going to go up with time unless we take relatively drastic measures to curb this,” said Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious diseases specialist at Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved with the new UN report. The climate crisis worsens antimicrobial resistance in several ways. Research has shown that increased temperatures increase both the rate of bacterial growth and the rate of the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes between microorganisms. “As we get a more extreme climate, especially as it warms, the gradients that drive the evolution of resistance will actually accelerate. So, by curbing temperature rises and reducing the extremity of events, we can actually then fundamentally curb the probability of evolving new resistance,” Dr. David Graham, a professor of ecosystems engineering at Newcastle University and one of the UN report’s authors, said at a news conference ahead of the report’s release. Experts also say severe flooding as a result of climate change can lead to conditions of overcrowding, poor sanitation and increased pollution, which are known to increase infection rates and antimicrobial resistance as human waste, heavy metals and other pollutants in water create favorable conditions for bugs to develop resistance. “The same drivers that cause environmental degradation are worsening the antimicrobial resistance problem. The impacts of antimicrobial resistance could destroy our health and food systems,” Inger Andersen, the UN Environment Programme’s executive director, said at the news conference. Environmental pressures are creating bugs that thrive in the human body, which experts say is unusual for some species. “There’s one hypothesis from a prominent mycologist who suggests that the reason the body’s temperature is 98.6 is because that is the temperature where fungi can’t grow that well. And so, now we’re seeing Candida auris and some of the other new microbes that have come up that really grow quite well – even at temperatures of 98.6 in the human body. And so I think climate change, really selecting for these organisms to adapt to a warmer climate, is going to increase the odds that there’s infection in humans,” Roberts said. Such opportunistic infections jeopardize medical advancements like joint replacements, organ transplants and chemotherapy – procedures in which patients have a significant risk of infection and require effective antibiotics. Drug-resistant infections can make treatment difficult or even impossible. Roberts says that resorting to “last-ditch treatments” is “never a good scenario from the patient level because there are reasons we don’t use them up front,” such as organ toxicity and failure. “When somebody does present with a drug-resistant bacteria or fungus and we really need to rely on one of these last-line antibiotics, it’s usually a challenge to treat from the outset. And so the patients really don’t do as well as a result,” he said. “In rare circumstances, we run out of options entirely, and in that case, there’s really nothing we can do. Fortunately, those cases remain quite rare, but I am certain that with this growing antibiotic resistance problem, we’ll see these increasing frequency over time.” Experts say that both climate change and antimicrobial resistance have been worsened by and can be improved by human actions. One critical step is to limit antibiotic overuse and misuse. “Antibiotics and antifungals do not work on viruses, such as colds and the flu. These drugs save lives. But, anytime they are used, they can lead to side effects and antimicrobial resistance,” the UN report’s authors wrote. The authors also emphasize that the health of people, animals, plants and the environment are closely linked and interdependent, and they call on governments to identify policies to limit antibiotic use in agriculture and reduce environmental pollution. Finally, experts say, steps to reduce climate change are steps to limit antimicrobial resistance. “Whatever we can do on an individual level to kind of reduce the impact of climate change, really, that’s kind of only worsening this problem, as well as pollution and urbanization and in dense, crowded areas. Although I know from the individual level that’s a hard thing to change,” Roberts said."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Europe has experienced an exceptionally warm January, with average temperatures 2.2 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1990 to 2020 average, according to data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. The month started with a record-breaking heatwave, as New Year’s Day saw an alarming number of heat records fall across the continent, with at least eight countries experiencing their warmest-ever January day. The climatologist Maximiliano Herrera, who tracks extreme temperatures across the globe, told CNN at the time that it was “the most extreme heat wave in European history.” The Balkans, eastern Europe, Finland, northwest Russia and Svalbard, the Arctic archipelago off the coast of Norway, all experienced particularly high temperatures in January, according to Copernicus, which analyzes billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world. “While January 2023 is exceptional, these extreme temperatures remain a tangible indication of the effects of a changing climate for many regions and can be understood as an additional warning of future extreme events,” Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement. Europe is warming faster than any other region, according to the World Meteorological Organization, as planet-heating pollution pushes temperatures towards critical warming thresholds. The continent is seeing increased wildfires, blistering heatwaves and destructive droughts. Globally, January temperatures were 0.25 degrees warmer than the 1991-2020 January average, according to the Copernicus data, with places including the eastern United States, Canada and Mexico experiencing above average temperatures. The data also found record levels of sea ice melt in Antarctica in January. Sea ice extent – the amount of ocean covered in ice – was 31% below average, the lowest levels the satellite dataset has ever recorded and significantly below the previous record set in 2017. Unlike the Arctic where sea ice has been melting for decades, Antarctica’s sea ice is very variable. After years of sea ice increases, Antarctic sea ice started declining from 2016 and the region is now reporting record lows. Arctic sea ice extent was 4% below average, with the Barents Sea and Svalbard most affected, Copernicus data showed. It wasn’t hot everywhere. Below average temperatures were recorded in countries including Siberia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Australia. Some scientists have pointed to Arctic warming as one reason behind the extreme cold snaps the world continues to experience, even as winters become warmer overall. CNN’s Christian Edwards contributed reporting"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","When US startup Make Sunsets released two weather balloons into the skies above Mexico’s Baja California peninsula last year, it kicked up a fierce debate about one of the world’s most controversial climate solutions. The plan was for the balloons, filled with helium and a small amount of sulfur dioxide, to float high into the stratosphere. There they would burst, dispersing their load of sun-reflecting sulfur dioxide particles and cool the Earth, just a tiny bit. Some dismissed it as a stunt. It is not clear if any particles were actually released or even if the balloons made it to the stratosphere. But Make Sunsets’ experiment is significant for crossing a threshold when it comes to a hotly-debated climate solution: solar geoengineering. To its supporters, solar geoengineering is a fix we cannot ignore as the world hurtles toward climate disaster. For critics, it is a technology so dangerous we shouldn’t even research it. At its simplest, solar geoengineering, also known as solar radiation management, is an attempt to bring down the planet’s temperature by reflecting sunlight away or allowing more heat to escape into space. There are three main techniques: Marine cloud brightening involves trying to make the low clouds over the ocean more reflective by spraying them with sea salt. Cirrus cloud thinning targets wispy clouds higher up in the atmosphere, seeding them with aerosol particles in an attempt to thin them, so they trap less heat. The most-researched method, however, is stratospheric aerosol injection. It involves spraying aerosols – such as sulfur dioxide particles – into the stratosphere, more than 12 miles above the Earth’s surface, to reflect sunlight back into space. It could be done with balloons or specialized airplanes able to fly at high altitude. The idea takes its cue from volcanoes. When Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991, the sulfur dioxide it expelled high into the atmosphere had the effect of temporarily cooling the planet by 0.5 degrees Celsius (nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit). The idea has been around since the 1960s, but it’s getting more attention because progress to tackle climate change is so far off-pace. The world is on track to pass critical warming thresholds, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages increase dramatically. Scientists have even gone as far as to propose blowing moon dust toward the Earth to act as a sun shield, reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the planet. “I wish there was no geoengineering!” Luke Iseman, the founder of Make Sunsets told CNN in an email. But “there are no other realistic options to stay below 2 [degrees Celsius],” he said. While pretty much no one is claiming solar geoengineering could replace planet-warming pollution cuts and solve climate change, supporters argue it could have a big planetary cooling effect for a relatively small price tag. A 2018 Harvard study estimated it would cost around $2.25 billion a year over a 15-year period. The world needs to cut emissions, “no question,” David Keith, professor of applied physics and public policy, at Harvard University told CNN. But it doesn’t mean we can afford to ignore other climate solutions, he added. “I’m not saying we have to do solar geoengineering, but I think it’s worth considering all the tools,” he said. Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, told CNN there are good reasons to be skeptical of solar geoengineering. But, he said, if it “could provide a path for decreasing the impacts of climate change on millions of the world’s most vulnerable people (and on ecosystems), we have a responsibility to explore the opportunities, as well as the risks.” For some of the most at-risk countries, including low-lying island nations, climate change already threatens their existence. A 2019 survey of more than 700 climate experts found those who expected severe climate damage in their own countries were more supportive of solar geoengineering. In the eyes of its opponents, the technology could open the door to an almost infinite number of potential negative consequences. “Just because we’re desperate doesn’t suddenly make solar geoengineering a good idea, because the risks are so immense,” Lili Fuhr, from the Center for International Environmental Law, told CNN. There are fears fiddling with the planet’s thermostat could alter rainfall patterns and shift monsoons, with potentially devastating consequences for crops. Effects could vary across regions, with some areas reaping benefits while others are harmed, increasing the chance of conflict. “When things go wrong, it is usually the poor people that suffer the most,” said Chukwumerije Okereke, professor of global climate and environmental governance at Alex Ekwueme Federal University in Nigeria. People are already suggesting African countries as a testing ground for the technologies, Okereke said. “It is a distraction from the sort of policies and help that should be coming to Africa.” Solar geoengineering could also damage the ozone layer, which shields Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays, and is currently on track to repair itself after the success of a ban on ozone-depleting chemicals. Then there are the difficulties of implementation. As the aerosol particles do not tend to remain in the atmosphere for more than about a year, solar geoengineering would have to be continuously maintained. If halted, there is a risk of “termination shock,” unleashing all the pent-up warming “waiting in the wings, ready to slap the Earth in the face,” Raymond Pierrehumbert, professor of physics at Oxford University, told CNN. It would also require unprecedented international cooperation, Frank Biermann, professor of global sustainability governance at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, told CNN. “It would mean that countries have to collaborate forever,” he said, including those currently at war. One of the biggest criticisms of solar geoengineering is it could be grasped by polluters as a way to continue polluting, and by governments as a distraction from policies to reduce planet-heating pollution. In 2021, a group of nearly 400 scientists called for an “international non-use agreement,” a commitment to restrict the development of solar geoengineering “before it is too late.” Governments should consider solar geoengineering in the same way they do chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear testing and Arctic mining, Biermann said. There has been a flurry of interest in the technology, especially in the US. In 2019, Congress allocated $4 million to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for stratospheric research, some of which was for solar geoengineering. And last year, the Biden administration announced a five-year research plan to explore the concept. A 2021 report from the National Academy of Sciences called for the US to allocate up to $200 million to a research program to better understand solar geoengineering, including its feasibility, impacts on society and the environment, and public perceptions. Research organizations are also providing funding. In February, the UK-based Degrees Initiative announced $900,000 for research in countries across Africa, Asia and South America to look at how the technology could affect the Global South. So far, outdoor experiments have been difficult to get off the ground and have faced heavy resistance. An attempt by Harvard University researchers to test a high-altitude balloon in Arctic Sweden in 2021 was abandoned after an outcry from local Indigenous Sami people. A letter on behalf of the Sami Council said solar geoengineering “entails risks of catastrophic consequences.” And following Make Sunset’s balloon release, the Mexican government announced in January it would ban solar geoengineering experiments. As the world heats up and solar geoengineering shifts from sci-fi to mainstream, tussles between those who say there is an obligation to research it as a potential last-chance solution and those convinced it is the path to catastrophe are only likely to increase. Critics like Biermann, however, remain unwavering in their opposition. “It’s very risky. It cannot be governed. It’s unethical,” he said. “And it is one of the biggest dangers in the current climate policies.”"

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. This year might be another strike in the “loss column” for Punxsutawney Phil, which isn’t much of a surprise, since he’s wrong about 60% of the time. He forecast six more weeks of winter, yet it seems spring is already in full bloom across parts of the country where blooms should still be nearly a month away. Parts of the South and Southeast are seeing their earliest spring on record this year, with leaves already budding on trees as much as three weeks early. Other parts of the South and Southeast are seeing their earliest spring in 40 years. Contrast that with southern Arizona, where they are seeing their latest start to spring in 40 years. The National Phenology Network, which keeps track of the arrival of spring, maps the locations where it believes spring has already arrived. It does this by tracking the bloom of two plant species typically among the first to leaf out each year and are also “common across much of the country.” Much of the “early spring” has to do with the warm start to 2023. Much of the South and Southeast are off to their top-10 warmest years on record, and several cities are seeing their top-five warmest: Houston, Jackson, Nashville and Atlanta. It is even more dramatic in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Philadelphia and New York City are experiencing their warmest start to the year on record, so the early bloom will most likely expand into the Northeast in the weeks ahead. “Plants are really sensitive to temperature, humidity and rainfall. They’re sensitive to photo periods; so the sun and things like that. They’re responding to these kinds of triggers in the environment, these cues that the climate is giving them, and they respond to that,” Megan O’Connell, a research associate with the Botanical Research Institute of Texas, explained. O’Connell said spring is coming early more frequently – and climbing to warmer temperatures – because of climate change, which is a significant shift for plants and animals. The timing of when plants bloom is critical for the pollinators who depend on them. If the blooms appear early, the blooms could already be gone by the time pollinators appear, creating what scientists call “ecological mismatch.” “While things are getting warmer, the weather is also getting more erratic. And so, plants and animals are responding to these kinds of chaotic weather patterns all very differently,” O’Connell explained. “It’s not that we’re going to see everything just move forward together. It seems like species are all responding differently, which is the reason we’re seeing a lot of these kinds of mismatching trends.” One example is the monarch butterfly. Scientists have seen the milkweed they depend on to lay their eggs bloom earlier and earlier, but the butterflies are still showing up on time to fields where milkweed has already finished blooming and is gone. The mismatch might seem small but could have huge implications affecting all of us. “One out of every three bites of food that we eat” is directly connected to a pollinator, Ron Magill, communications director and wildlife expert at Zoo Miami, previously told CNN. Around 30% of the food on our tables gets there because of things like butterflies, bees and bats. “Think about the thousands of species of plants and pollinators out there. It could have some really catastrophic effects on ecosystems,” O’Connell said. But O’Connell pointed out we can help pollinators tremendously by planting as many native species as possible in our own yards. “You can create little pollinator resorts for them throughout the year. Look up different species of flowers that flower at different times in the season, and then plant flowers so that you can provide food to them all season,” O’Connell advised. Click here to see which plants are native to your area."

So we have to be prepared.” Hipkins didn’t mention the climate crisis by name, but his climate change minister James Shaw made the link clear in an emotional address to parliament two days earlier. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt as sad or as angry about the lost decades that we spent bickering and arguing about whether climate change was real or not,” Shaw said on Tuesday. “It is clearly here now, and if we do not act it will get worse.” What’s made this week’s devastation so shocking is that it came just two weeks after a short, sharp deluge in Auckland, the country’s largest city of 1.7 million people. That downpour caused flash flooding and landslides, and contributed to New Zealand’s wettest month on record –  all during what’s typically one of the driest months of the year. New Zealand owes its stunning landscape partly to the country’s long record of intense rainfall. Rain regularly dumped on its mountains has carved rivers that rage after downpours. Many towns and cities sit on their banks – established to take advantage of access to ports and trade routes, which for a long time has served communities well. “New Zealand is very good at building communities on floodplains – there’s a large fraction of the population that live close to rivers that tend to flood,” said James Renwick, a weather and climate researcher at Victoria University of Wellington. “There tends to be the attitude that we can build stop banks and that will protect the community, and it does most of the time, until you get a really big event.” Those really big events are expected to become more frequent as global temperatures warm. New Zealand lies in the South Pacific Ocean, and is vulnerable to tropical cyclones that typically form in the north but can affect any part of the country in their path. This week, the northeast suffered the biggest hit as Cyclone Gabrielle whipped up winds and days of rain. La Niña, a weather event that results in warmer air and sea temperatures, also contributed to Gabrielle’s strength. Sam Dean, principal scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research or NIWA, said climate change is not necessarily going to increase the frequency of tropical cyclones, but it will make them more powerful. “They’re occurring over sea surface temperatures that are warmer than they were. The atmosphere is warmer and it’s holding more moisture, so there’s just more fuel, more energy available that makes them more intense, it makes them more damaging,” he said. “It makes the winds a little bit stronger. It makes the rainfall more significant.” And cyclones like Gabrielle can form and move around just about any part of the country, he said, so the risk isn’t just in one part of the nation. “I don’t think there’s any part of New Zealand that isn’t at risk of extreme rainfall,” he said. But heavy rainfall isn’t the only risk posed by climate change in New Zealand, long considered a safe haven by those seeking refuge from global troubles. Parts of the country have experienced drought in recent years, and even a few years ago, Auckland – the city hit by a short bout of intense rainfall in January – was close to running out of water. “The whole area is usually very dry and very close to drought this time of year. Now it’s soaking wet,” said Daithi Stone, a climate scientist at NIWA. “But that risk of drought hasn’t gone away, (and) in our predictions of how climate change is going to affect New Zealand, that’s a feature that seems to be fairly robust –  that Northland (north of Auckland) will get drier.” Heat waves could also become a risk in a country that’s not accustomed to unbearably hot temperatures, Stone added. “We’re not used to heat waves … over here, it’s a novel concept. And I think we may get a fright sometime in the not too distant future,” he said. With just 5 million people, New Zealand is a small player when it comes to global carbon emissions. Last year, it produced 78.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent – well below the biggest emitters, China and the United States. But the New Zealand government takes climate change seriously, and last year released its first emissions reductions plan to meet a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. It also released a national adaptation plan to mitigate climate disasters in the future. Dean, from NIWA, said Cyclone Gabrielle was likely to prompt an acceleration of that plan. “You can see an urgency to get some of these things in place and I think that’s been motivated, definitely, by this event,” he said. Renwick, from Victoria University, said an obvious solution would be to move people away from coastlines and rivers that are at risk of more frequent flooding. But he said communities with long ties to the area will likely be reluctant to leave, and he predicted a greater emphasis on protection than relocation. “I suspect the main response is going to be protection works rather than moving people away. So building sea walls, building levees, stop banks, putting houses up on higher piles,” he said. During his visit to Gisborne, Hipkins said Cyclone Gabrielle had made clear to him that the country needs to improve its climate defenses. “There’s no question that as a country we need to look at the resilience of our infrastructure. And we need to do that with a much greater sense of urgency, I think, than we have ever seen before,” he said. That may include spending money to relocate roads subject to repeated flooding, he added. “We actually just have to get real about some of the roads and the fact that we’re going to have to move some of those roads to places where they can be more resilient.” But aside from adapting, as a small country, New Zealand is reliant on the biggest emitters doing more to prevent global temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius – the threshold scientists say is needed to prevent the more catastrophic effects of the climate crisis. The world is already at least 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before industrialization. “What we need to see is China and the US, Australia, Canada, Brazil and the big emitters starting to pull their emissions down as well, and I hope we can provide a bit of inspiration, a bit of an example in this country to help other countries do the same,” Renwick said. “We really want to stop warming the climate more because these extreme events will become overwhelming.”"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Dangerous climate feedback loops are increasing global warming and risk causing a permanent shift away from the Earth’s current climate, according to a new study. Climate feedback loops are cyclical chain reactions that happen when one change triggers further changes, in a process that keeps on repeating itself. Some of these feedback loops drive down warming, but others amplify it. Take Arctic ice, for example. Warming temperatures cause sea ice to melt, revealing the dark ocean water beneath. As dark surfaces absorb more heat than reflective surfaces like ice, the ocean warms and more ice melts. A group of international scientists from institutions including Oregon State University, Exeter University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, pored over climate literature to identify 41 climate feedback loops. Of these, they found that 27 are driving up global temperatures, according to the study published Friday in the scientific journal One Earth, while just seven are helping to slow the pace of climate crisis. William Ripple, Professor of Ecology at Oregon State University and a lead author on the study, told CNN that forest die-off, smoldering peatlands and thawing permafrost were particularly worrisome. “These feedbacks may be large and are difficult to accurately quantify,” Ripple told CNN. The researchers were surprised by the large number of amplifying climate feedback loops they found, he added. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the most extensive list available of climate feedback loops, and not all of them are fully considered in climate models,” Christopher Wolf, a postdoctoral scholar at Oregon State University and the study’s other lead author, said in a statement. Climate feedback loops can also indirectly affect each other, according to the study, creating a complex web of interconnected changes that can accelerate the impacts of the climate crisis. For example, planet-warming pollution released by thawing permafrost – the frozen layer of soil that blankets the Arctic and other parts of the planet’s far north – increases global temperatures, which in turn helps create the hotter, drier conditions that make wildfires spread faster and burn more intensely. Wildfires release planet-heating pollution, further raising temperatures, and so on. These interconnections “make it challenging to predict the precise impacts of climate change,” Ripple said. There is a risk that some of these feedback loops could trigger climate tipping points. For example, feedback loops accelerating Arctic ice melt could ultimately cause the Greenland ice sheet to collapse. “In the worst case, if amplifying feedbacks are strong enough, the result is likely tragic climate change that’s moved beyond anything humans can control,” Ripple said in a statement. The study also found seven “dampening” feedback loops, which help stabilize the climate system. These included the ability of land and oceans to absorb planet-heating carbon emissions. It’s important to “try to get a handle on the strength of all these feedbacks,” Tim Lenton, Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter and one of the co-authors, told CNN, to better understand how they work within the complex climate system. “We, already at 1.5 [degrees Celsius], are likely to cross multiple tipping points, causing feedback loops that would make our options for a safe climate future even fewer,” Johan Rockström, Director of the Potsdam institute and a co-author of the study, told CNN. The authors called for “immediate and massive” reductions in planet-warming pollution, as well as increased research into climate feedback loops. “It’s too late to fully prevent the pain of climate change, but if we take meaningful steps soon while prioritizing human basic needs and social justice, it could still be possible to limit the harm,” Ripple said."

","Jennifer Gray, CNN Meteorologist","Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. Despite the fact spring is showing up early this year, we must remember winter isn’t over yet. A major winter storm is set to impact millions this week, from coast to coast, with heavy snow, dangerous winds, possible blizzard conditions and for some, the coldest temperatures of the season. What to expect this week: The storm is already showing signs of life along the West Coast, as snow and rain is already falling across the Pacific Northwest, adding to their already blockbuster snow season. “Storm total snowfall will likely be measured in feet for many of the mountain ranges across the West,” the Weather Prediction Center said. The Cascade Mountains could see as much as three feet of snow in the highest elevations through Tuesday, while winds in the Pacific Northwest have the potential to gust up to 60 mph. Seas just offshore will be as high as 20 feet, bringing large, breaking waves to coastal areas, causing beach erosion. By Tuesday, the storm expands into California and the Great Basin, bringing rain, snow and gusty winds, which could lead to power outages. “The coldest storm of the season, and possibly of the last several years is expected to impact southwest (California) Wed-Fri or Sat with showers across coasts and valleys with mainly snow across the mountains and deserts,” the National Weather Service office in Los Angeles tweeted Sunday. “Snow or graupel may even occur across some elevated valleys!” Graupel refers to snow pellets resembling soft hail. Parts of California could pick up as much two to three inches of rain, and up to three feet of snow through Wednesday, which could lead to travel headaches around some of the most densely populated areas. “This amount of snow will result in the passes needing to be closed for a period of time which will impact traffic getting to and from Los Angeles,” The National Weather Service office in Hanford, California said. If you are waking up across the south-central US, chances are you didn’t get much sleep. Insanely strong storms ripped through traveling close to 100 mph. At one point, the National Weather Service Office in Norman, Oklahoma called them “historic.” Blizzard warnings are in place for southern Wyoming, where nearly two feet of snow and winds gusting more than 70 mph will create blinding conditions. The weather service also warns of wind chills falling to 25 degrees below zero. The storm releases its fury on the Midwest Tuesday through Thursday, with two rounds of snow. The first round on Tuesday will bring four to six inches of snow to much of the region. The big problems come in for the second round Wednesday night into Thursday. This is where we could see up to two feet of snow across the Midwest, along with 50 mph wind gusts. Travel will be nearly impossible during this time frame. With the storm still a few days away, the weather service is still fine-tuning the details. “If this forecast holds, Blizzard Warnings are likely for the second half of the storm. As for when and exactly where the threat transitions from snow load/poor roads to poor visibility and inability to travel, that will come as we get closer,” the weather service office in Twin Cities explained. Check here for your latest forecast Thursday will also bring a swath of icy weather for some big cities, including Chicago. Ice could also be a problem for parts of the Ohio Valley, yet pinpointing exactly where it will occur is challenging this far out. Stay tuned with the forecast if you live in these areas, because freezing rain and sleet could halt your travel plans and even cause power outages. While the northern half of the storm will be all snow, the southern half will be heavy rain. We could see strong storms develop on Wednesday for places like Dallas, Little Rock, Shreveport and Memphis. The Storm Prediction Center has highlighted the area as a region with the potential for large hail, damaging winds and possible tornadoes. The storm does make it to the Northeast and New England by the end of the week. As of now, it looks like New York City is left out of the snow once again, however, Boston could get a couple of inches. Things could change between now and then, but as of now much of the snowfall looks to be exclusively for the Interior Northeast and much of New England. The winter part of this storm system will get most of the attention this week, but the temperature swing across the country cannot be ignored. We could set more than 130 high temperature records across the Southeast Tuesday through Friday, with more than 40 record low temperatures possibly broken across the Northwest. On Wednesday and Thursday, temperatures will run 30 to 40 degrees below normal for the northern Rockies and northern Plains, while temperatures run 20 to 30 degrees above normal for the Southeast and mid-Atlantic. On Thursday, there could be a 100-degree temperature spread from North Dakota to Florida. Whether you are buried under three feet of snow and experiencing frigid temperatures or basking in the sunshine and record warmth, this week will touch nearly all corners of the country with wild weather. CNN Meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this story."

",Story by Reuters,"China is home to 16 of the 20 regions of the world most vulnerable to climate change, according to data published on Monday, with some of the world’s most important manufacturing hubs at risk from rising water levels and extreme weather. The state of Florida ranked as the most vulnerable region outside of China. Climate risk specialists XDI assessed more than 2,600 regions worldwide, using climate models together with weather and environmental data to assess the economic damage that temperature rises could cause by 2050. The study is based on a 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperatures by the end of the century, under a scenario drawn up by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The data showed that some of the engine rooms of the global economy face catastrophic hazards such as rising sea levels, river flooding and wildfires, which could also lower property prices and deter investment, XDI said. The Chinese coastal province of Jiangsu, which is heavily industrialized and accounts for a tenth of China’s GDP, was ranked the world’s most vulnerable territory, followed by neighboring Shandong and the major steel production base of Hebei. The flood-prone central province of Henan was fourth. The shift of global manufacturing to Asia has driven a substantial increase in infrastructure investment in already vulnerable regions throughout China, making it more susceptible to the impacts of climate change, Hamden said. “Infrastructure investment has tended to be concentrated in areas that have traditionally been very high-risk - river deltas, coastal zones, and relatively flat areas,” he said. The highest ranking non-Chinese region was Florida in 10th place, with California 19th, Texas 20th and New York 46th. Nine territories from India were also in the top 50. While climate is likely to become increasingly decisive when it comes to determining the flow of capital, it remains to be seen whether it will deter investment in more vulnerable regions, said Karl Mallon, XDI’s co-founder. “There is a lot to be done to work out which areas in the world are potentially adaptable and defendable, and which are probably the areas we will see abandoned in due course,” he said."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/21/world/antarctic-sea-ice-record-low-climate-intl/index.html,Antarctic sea ice hit record lows again. Scientists wonder if it’s ‘the beginning of the end’,02-21-2023,"                                                 Sea ice in Antarctica hit a record low this year and is “on a very steep downward trend,” a sign this complex and isolated region may finally be responding to the climate crisis.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","Antarctic sea ice has reached record low levels for the second time in two years, with some scientists alarmed that dramatic drops are a signal the climate crisis may now be more clearly influencing this vast, complex and isolated region. The sea ice that fringes Antarctica dropped to just 737,000 square miles (1.91 million square kilometers) on February 13, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, or NSIDC, below the previous record of 741,000 square miles (1.92 million square kilometers) set on February 25 last year. Sea ice could still shrink further; the lowest level of the southern summer may not be reached for more than a week. The last two years mark the only time that sea ice levels have dipped below 2 million square kilometers since satellites began monitoring it in 1978. It’s “not just ‘barely a record low,’” Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CNN. “It’s on a very steep downward trend.” Unlike the Arctic, where the rate of sea ice loss has followed a fairly consistent downward trajectory as climate change accelerates, Antarctic sea ice extent has swung up and down, making it harder to figure out how the continent and its surrounding ocean are responding to global heating. The two polar regions are very different. While the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by continents, Antarctica is a continent surrounded by the ocean – this means its sea ice can grow outward, unconstrained by land. Antarctic ice tends to be thinner than Arctic ice, with greater highs in the winter and steeper declines in the summer. Climate models projected declines in Antarctic sea ice that were similar to the Arctic, but until recently the region was behaving completely differently than those models predicted. It hit a record high for winter sea ice extent in 2014 when it reached 7.76 million square miles, which seemed to support the idea that the Antarctic may be relatively insulated from global warming. But in 2016, something changed. Scientists began observing a steep downward trend. At first, some put it down to the usual variability of this vastly complex continent, with its diverse, intertwined climate systems. But after two low sea ice records in a row, scientists are becoming concerned. “The question is, has climate change reached Antarctica? Is this the beginning of the end? Will the sea ice disappear for good in the coming years in the summer?” Christian Haas, head of the Sea Ice Physics Research Section at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, told CNN. Several factors may feed into why sea ice is so low, including winds, ocean currents and ocean heat. Air temperatures have been higher than usual in parts of the Antarctic, around 1.5 degrees Celsius above the long term average. Another important consideration is the belt of westerly winds which circle Antarctica, known as the Southern Annular Mode. These winds, which can increase sea ice melt, have been stronger than usual, according to the NSIDC, and added to weather conditions that pump warm air to the region. The strength of the winds has been linked, in part, to the increase of planet-heating pollution as well as the hole in the ozone layer above the continent. There are also suggestions that sea ice may be melting because of warmth trapped just below the surface of the ocean, Scambos said. “Basically, you’re getting heat stirred into the upper layer [of water] around the Antarctic,” he said. If that theory holds up, and is linked to the general warming of the oceans, “then that has big implications for the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet.” The disappearance of sea ice can have cascading effects in Antarctica and beyond. While it doesn’t directly affect sea levels, because it is already floating in the ocean, the loss of the fringe of sea ice around the Antarctic leaves coastal ice sheets and glaciers exposed to waves and warm ocean waters, making them much more vulnerable to melting and breaking up. An altered Antarctic landscape could have significant impacts on its wildlife, from the microorganisms and algae that prop up the food chain – food for krill which, in turn, feed many of the region’s whales – to the penguins and seals that rely on sea ice for feeding and resting. Parts of Antarctica have been seeing alarming changes for a while. The Antarctic Peninsula, a spindly chain of icy mountains which sticks off the west side of the continent like a thumb pointing toward South America, is one of the fastest warming places in the Southern Hemisphere. Carlos Moffat, an oceanographer at the University of Delaware, who has just returned from a research trip to the Antarctic Peninsula, told CNN that the low sea ice and very warm ocean temperatures they found “are dramatically different from what we have observed in the last few decades.” Moffat, who visits the region every summer as part of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research, said: “This year’s conditions are against a backdrop of long-term change in this region of Antarctica.” Last year, scientists said West Antarctica’s vast Thwaites Glacier  – also known as the “Doomsday Glacier” – was “hanging on by its fingernails” as the planet warms, with rapid retreat possible over the next few years. Scientists have estimated global sea level rise could increase by around 10 feet if Thwaites collapsed completely, devastating coastal communities around the world. It’s too early to say whether the record sea ice decline is the new normal or whether it will bounce back, and Antarctica is known for its significant swings. The NSIDC points out that: “While 2022 and 2023 have had record low minimum extent, four out of the five highest minimums have occurred since 2008.” “It’s going to take a while to unpack,” Scambos said. “We’re still reacting to a relatively sudden change. Certainly the last few years have been a dramatic exclamation point on a trend that was just developing after 2016.” Scientists will need at least another five years of data and observations, he estimated, but added: “It does feel like something has changed in the Antarctic and that things are fairly dramatic.” Correction: This story has been updated to correct the name of Christian Haas. Furthermore, the last two years are only times in the satellite era that sea ice extent has fallen below 2 million square kilometers."

Analysts even say it might soon surpass vodka as the best-selling liquor in the country. But scientists from around the world have made it clear that climate change-fueled water shortages will continue to put enormous pressure on food production. Wine and spirits, unfortunately, are not spared from that forecast. A 2019 study found that the climate crisis, coupled with overgrazing from cattle ranching and other human activities, may disrupt the distribution and cultivation of agave, the main ingredient of tequila. While agave is a drought-tolerant plant that can thrive in hot weather with little to no water, Omanjana Goswami, a food and environment scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the life cycle of agave is too fragile to endure the major weather whiplash the climate crisis is generating – from extreme drought to deadly storm deluges like the one California just experienced. “Agave is a desert plant, so of course, anything that is moving towards that desert-like weather is going to help this crop thrive,” Goswami told CNN. “But unfortunately, climate effects are not linear. It doesn’t mean that as temperatures warm that will remain consistent.” “With extreme weather in conjunction with unpredictability, it’s so hard to predict where this is going to go in the future,” she added. Aside from agave plants being sensitive to weather whiplash, there’s also a significant climate threat to pollinators. Bees, butterflies and bats pollinate roughly 30% of the food that ends up on our tables. Bats, like birds, are also considered a major seed disperser. But as temperatures warm, weather gets more extreme and seasons shift, those pollinators are at risk of major disruption. Warming temperatures have become a growing concern for the Mexican long-nosed bat — a key species for tequila. “You wouldn’t have tequila if you had no bats, because that’s the only thing that pollinates the agave plant that makes tequila,” Ron Magill, the communications director and a wildlife expert at Zoo Miami, previously told CNN. There are hundreds of species of agave, but only one — the Weber Azul agave plant — makes tequila. Other agave species were abandoned in Mexico and in the desert regions of the Southwest US. By law, to be considered authentic “tequila,” the spirit must come from the Tequila region in Mexico. Otherwise, agave liquors produced in places like California can only be labeled as an agave spirit. Because of the high demand for agave spirits, it’s easy for farmers to fall into the practice of monoculture, where they reuse the same soil to grow a single crop, leading to a loss in genetic diversity, scientists told CNN. That includes places like California, where farmers do not rely on external pollinators like bats to grow their agave crops. But some researchers like Ron Runnebaum, an assistant professor of viticulture and enology at the University of California, Davis, are looking to explore more of that genetic diversity to see what variants besides the blue agave can adapt and survive in a changing climate to avoid the loss in diversity. “For us, in the United States, and especially in California, there are just a lot of questions around how we would be able to grow this economically as a crop as a way of diversifying the portfolios of farmers, as they’re facing water shortages, as well as these other extreme events whether extended droughts or an abundance of water in a short period of time,” Runnebaum told CNN. Agave plants require little watering and can allow farmers to plant crops on land that would have otherwise been fallowed due to lack of water. And while it takes six to eight years for agave plants to mature, scientists say agave plants can also suck planet-warming carbon pollution out of the atmosphere. Given these benefits – and as the West is mired in a multi-year drought – Craig Reynolds, an agave grower and founding director of the California Agave Council, said he sees agave spirits as an economic opportunity in a hotter and drier future. Eight years ago, Reynolds began growing agave in Northern California as an experiment to see if it would be a viable crop in response to water scarcity. “We’ve gotten a lot of attention, because the biggest issue (for farmers) is the water,” he told CNN. The “severe cutbacks and groundwater allowances in state and federal water project deliveries, and the fallowing of hundreds of thousands of acres in California and projected long-term fallowing of farmland” is causing the growing interest, he said. With the help of UC Davis, more resources are going into researching the viability of the low-water crop, especially under a rapidly changing climate. Reynolds said industries need to start adapting and thinking about ways to survive in a hotter and drier future. “There’s going to be some failures and setbacks here and there,” Reynolds said. “I’m not hoping for the climate to change. I’m just realistic in that we need to do everything we can to slow climate change, but we also have to simultaneously have adaptation strategies to the climate change that is happening – and agave is just part of the adaptation strategy.”"

At the same time, much of the South, from Texas to the Carolinas, had afternoon temperatures above 80 degrees, including a scorching 95 in McAllen, Texas. The extreme cold in the North is just one aspect of the coast-to-coast storm bringing heavy snow, high winds and ice on Wednesday, putting parts of more than two dozen states under winter weather alerts as travel conditions begin to deteriorate in some areas. More than 65 million people across 29 states, from as far west as California to Minnesota through Maine, were under winter weather alerts as of Wednesday morning, including warnings of severe icing, extreme cold and sleet that are likely to make travel dangerous and knock out power to some. The Upper Midwest is expected to bear the brunt of the storm in terms of snowfall, with the Minneapolis area likely getting more than 20 inches Wednesday and more than 2 feet over the multiday storm – potentially the most in 30 years. The Twin Cities reported 3 to 5 inches of snow Wednesday morning, and a second round of snow and high winds is expected at night into Thursday morning, making for life-threatening travel conditions, the National Weather Service said. The Minnesota Department of Transportation announced Wednesday afternoon that various state highways and I-90 are closed due to blizzard conditions and poor visibility. But it’s more than just snow. An ice storm warning is in place for more than 9 million people across a stretch from Iowa to southern Michigan. Also, significant icing is possible for the mid-Atlantic by late Wednesday; a severe weather threat and high winds are possible from Oklahoma to Missouri; and flooding is likely from heavy rain in parts of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. And more than 2 million were under blizzard warnings across parts of Wyoming, Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Dakotas. Meanwhile, warm weather prevailed in parts of the South and a few other areas. More than 30 high-temperature records for the calendar day were broken, including Nashville, Tennessee (80 degrees), Mobile, Alabama (82), Charleston, West Virginia (78), and Cincinnati (72). The Southeast generally saw temperatures in the 70s and 80s -- a stark contrast to the frigid conditions further north. Out west, strong winds from the powerful storm tore down power lines and initially knocked out power to more than 140,000 homes and businesses in California on Tuesday, with many of the outages happening in the northern counties of  San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz, according to the tracking site PowerOutage.us. As of Wednesday evening, almost 60,000 California outages remained. Power outages also were afflicting parts of the Midwest Wednesday evening as snow and freezing rain hit the region. Almost 500,000 customers were without power in four states there, including more than 340,000 in Michigan and more than 115,000 in Illinois, according to the tracking site. California still is bracing for several feet of snow expected in the mountains with a few inches possible in lower elevations, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said. An in an extremely rare event for that part of the country, blizzard warnings have been issued for the mountains of California’s Los Angeles and Ventura counties, taking effect early Friday morning and lasting through Saturday afternoon. This is the first blizzard warning that the weather service’s Los Angeles office has issued since February 1989, the office said. “Nearly (the) entire population of California will be able to see snow from some vantage point later this week if they look in the right direction,” according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. The unseasonable weather for the state comes nearly two months after rounds of deadly flooding battered many areas. “Now is the time to prepare for a COLD AND DANGEROUS winter storm expected for much of the week,” the weather service in Los Angeles said. “Gusty and potentially damaging winds are also expected.” More than 1,600 flights scheduled for Wednesday within, into or out of the US have been canceled, largely in Minneapolis, Denver, Detroit and Chicago, according to the tracking site FlightAware. For Minneapolis, the “historic” three-day storm “will bring widespread accumulating snow, with blowing and drifting snow mainly Wednesday through Thursday,” the National Weather Service in the Twin Cities said. The worst impacts over the Twin Cities region – which generally includes the cities of Minneapolis, St. Paul and their surrounding suburbs – are expected to begin late Wednesday into Thursday. Heavy snow is expected to blanket the grounds fairly quickly, and be accompanied by gusty winds. The weather service said to expect sustained winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 40 mph that will lead to blizzard conditions Wednesday afternoon. A second round of snow overnight could produce another 9 to 12 inches, with some areas getting up to 15 inches, the service said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz directed the state’s National Guard, the transportation department and the state patrol to be prepared to respond storm impacts, he said on Twitter. “We’re working to ensure we’re ready – and Minnesotans have a part to play, too. Plan ahead, drive safe, and limit travel,” Walz wrote. Parts of the Upper Midwest could see snow fall at a rate of 1 to 2 inches per hour, combined with wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph, the National Weather Service said. That unrelenting double whammy is set to create whiteout conditions due to falling and blowing snow. Those expected conditions have put more than 2 million people are under blizzard warnings across parts of Wyoming, Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Dakotas. • Minneapolis: The city could pick up between 15 and 25 inches snow by Thursday. That would be in addition to the 1 to 3 inches that have already fallen there. • Sioux Falls, South Dakota: In addition to the up to 4 inches of snow the state has already seen, snowfall up to 16 inches and winds of 45 mph are also expected. • Cheyenne, Wyoming: Heavy snowfall up to 1 foot expected in addition to high winds that could feel as cold as 35 below zero. • Potentially dangerous icing: Milwaukee in Wisconsin and Detroit and Ann Arbor in Michigan are likely to experience icing beginning Wednesday. • Severe thunderstorms: Damaging winds and rain are expected Wednesday morning through the afternoon in parts of Oklahoma into western Arkansas, across Missouri and western Illinois, according to the National Weather Service. Wednesday’s expected conditions have spurred states to take safety measures. South Dakota’s governor announced Tuesday the closures of state government executive branch offices Wednesday in more than half of the state’s 66 counties, with plans for employees to work remotely. Additionally, interstates 29 and 90 partially closed Tuesday night to prepare for the expected snow. South Dakota officials announced Wednesday they will be closing sections of those two interstates. In Minnesota, various state highways and portions of I-90 were closed Wednesday due to blizzard conditions. Still, more than 100 crashes had been reported across the state between 7:30 to 11:30 a.m., according to the Minnesota State Patrol. An additional 34 crashes were reported in the following four hours. Meanwhile, in Wyoming, several institutions decided to shutter their doors Wednesday, and portions of I-25 and I-80 were closed. Eastern Wyoming College announced the closure of its main campus. The Natrona County school district in Casper will conduct a virtual learning day Wednesday due to hazardous weather and road conditions throughout the area, the district said. The Food Bank of Wyoming, which says it serves all 23 counties across the state, planned to close Wednesday, it said in a tweet. CNN’s Theresa Waldrop, Robert Shackelford, Joe Sutton, Andy Rose and Michelle Watson contributed to this report."

Here’s why that’s not a good thing,02-23-2023,"                                                 As parts of the West and Northern US face a winter storm with blizzard conditions and significant snowfall, much of the rest of the country is experiencing a summer-like heat that has never been felt before during the month of February.                                             ","Rachel Ramirez, Laura Paddison and Brandon Miller, CNN","As parts of the West and Northern US face a winter storm with blizzard conditions and significant snowfall, much of the rest of the country is experiencing a summer-like heat that has never been felt before during the month of February. More than 130 cities from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes could set new records for daily and monthly high temperatures this week. Highs will climb up to 80 degrees as far north as Ohio and West Virginia — certainly unusual, but becoming less so in the warming climate. Here’s a stark example: Before this decade, Charleston, West Virginia, had only hit 80 degrees before March three times in more than 100 years of record-keeping. But this week’s incredible warmth will mean that four of the last six years will have logged temperatures of 80 degrees, which is its normal high on June 1, in February. Record warmth in February — a time that’s supposed to still feel like winter — might not sound like such a bad thing, but its negative consequences spread across the plant world, sports, tourism and agriculture. And it is another clear sign that our planet is warming rapidly, experts say. “Whenever we get these events, we should always be thinking there’s the possibility or likelihood that human-induced climate change is increasing the likelihood of strange weather,” Richard Seager, climate researcher at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, told CNN. “The more it goes on, the more they can bring such tremendous damage.” On the Great Lakes, ice coverage reached a record low for this time of the year — the same time that the annual maximum extent of ice usually occurs. As of last week, only 7% of the five freshwater lakes were covered in ice, a sharp difference from the 35 to 40% ice cover typically expected in mid-to-late February, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Great Lakes ice is on a downward trend, NOAA scientists report. A recent study found a 70% decline in the lakes’ ice cover between 1973 and 2017. The decline in Great Lakes ice each winter may not seem like it has any harmful impact, but that ice acts as a buffer for large, wind-driven waves in the winter, scientists have reported. Without the ice, the coastlines are more susceptible to erosion and flooding. Ayumi Fujisaki-Manome, a research scientist at NOAA’s Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research at the University of Michigan, said low ice coverage could also set the stage for another severe lake-effect snow storm like the one Buffalo, New York, experienced in December. “The moisture and heat from the lake surface water are absorbed into the atmosphere by storm systems, and then fall back to the ground as snow in the winter,” Fujisaki-Manome said in a statement. The thin ice has already had deadly consequences in New England. At Vermont’s Lake Champlain, the annual ice fishing tournament was cancelled last weekend when three fishermen died after falling through the ice. One man’s body was found hours after he was expected to return home from the lake, while the other two died after their utility vehicle broke through the ice. Montpelier, Vermont, had its warmest January on record this year since 1948, with Burlington recording its fifth warmest January since 1884, according to the Burlington National Weather Service. Robert Wilson, a professor of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said the Northeast as a whole is now a “fast-warming region,” with winter seasons warming faster than summers due to the climate crisis. And he underscored how this trend is threatening some of New England’s most cherished winter activities. “In coming decades, winter — as most people understand it — will get shorter and warmer, with less snow and more rain,” Wilson said. “This poses a serious threat to winter recreation: snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, and downhill skiing.” Plants are blooming way earlier than usual across much of the country, a clear sign that spring is either right around the corner — or it has already arrived, in some places. “Spring is coming early in much of the Southern and Eastern US,” Brad Rippey, meteorologist with the US Department of Agriculture, told CNN. “Here in the mid-Atlantic, that means everything from budding trees to crocuses in bloom to spring peepers making lots of noise — and in February, no less.” Many plants species — including daffodils, witch-hazel, forsythia and even cherry blossoms — are beginning to leaf out in the East. Theresa Crimmins, director of the USA National Phenology Network, said it’s the plants responding to very early warm temperatures. “Plants, especially those of temperate systems, respond to a number of cues in order to wake up in the spring, including exposure to chill in the winter, exposure to warmth in the spring, and day length,” she told CNN. If another cold snap occurs after an early warm spell, Crimmins said it could be disruptive and damaging for the plants’ cycle. As flower buds develop, many species lose their ability to tolerate cold temperatures, which means a freeze could kill blooms and leave fruit crops and other commodities vulnerable to spring freezes. Rippey said warm winters followed by a spring freeze has become more common in recent years. In 2017, for instance, a severe spring freeze in March damaged several fruit crops — peaches, blueberries, apples and strawberries — in states including Georgia and South Carolina, which carried an economic toll of roughly $1.2 billion. “As nice as it feels to have temperatures in the 70s and 80s this time of year, the fact that it’s not ‘normal’ can have a profound impact on the ecosystem,” Rippey said. “Even a typical spring freeze can damage commercial and back-yard fruit crops that have been pushed into blooming by late-winter warmth.” India issued its first heatwave alert, with temperatures in some states reaching 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) – up to 9 degrees Celsius (16.2 Fahrenheit) above normal, according to data released by the India Meteorological Department on Monday. “The heatwave warnings as early as February is a scary situation,” Krishna AchutaRao, a professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, told CNN. It has raised fears of a repeat of last year’s deadly heatwave, which scorched swaths of India and Pakistan. Blistering heat has devastating consequences for people’s health, for water supplies and for crops; last year, crop yields were reduced by as much as a third in some parts of the country. As temperatures soared last spring, India banned exports of wheat, dashing hopes that the world’s second-largest wheat producer would fill the supply gap caused by the war in Ukraine. This February, with high temperatures hitting wheat-producing states, including Rajasthan and Gujarat, India has set up a committee to monitor the impact of rising temperatures on the crop, according to Reuters. Europe, too, has seen unusually high temperatures, kicking off 2023 with an extreme winter heatwave that broke January temperature records in several countries. Low levels of snow and rainfall have fueled concerns about the region’s rivers and lakes. The River Po, which winds through northern Italy’s agricultural heartland, fed by snow from the Alps and rainfall in the spring, is at very low levels, while water in Lake Garda in northern Italy has reached record lows. There are fears Italy, which declared a state of emergency last year after its worst drought in 70 years, may face another drought. The unusually warm weather has also left ski resorts across the Alps with little or no snow. In February, top skiers wrote an open letter to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation demanding action on the climate crisis. “The seasons have shifted,” they wrote. “Our sport is threatened existentially.” While ski resorts have adapted to warming by relying on artificial snow – a process that uses a lot of water and energy – Wilson noted that resorts would still need cold nighttime temperatures to make it. “The long-term survival of skiing and other winter recreation will depend on nations lowering their carbon emissions to avoid the more dire consequences and severe warming in the future,” he said. CNN’s Keith Allen contributed to this report."

","Christian Edwards and Gabby Gretener, CNN","A winter heatwave, record low levels of rain and a startling lack of snow in Europe are pushing rivers, canals and lakes across the continent to alarmingly low levels, with experts warning there could be repeat of last year’s severe droughts. Images of dried-up river beds and shrunken lakes are usually associated with the scorching heat of summer – not the winter. But an exceptionally warm and dry start to the year is affecting a swath of Europe, including central and southwest France, northern Spain and northern Italy. There are concerns for what this might mean for water supplies. Europe’s water situation has become “very precarious,” according to a study published in January by researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria, which used satellite data to analyze the world’s groundwater resources. “A few years ago, I would never have imagined that water would be a problem here in Europe,” said Torsten Mayer-Gürr, one of the researchers. “We are actually getting problems with the water supply here – we have to think about this.” France, which is experiencing its driest stretch in more than 60 years, may soon bring in water restrictions. The country “suffered a series of 32 consecutive days without any significant rainfall from January 21 to February 21,” Simon Mittelberger, a climatologist at Météo-France, told CNN – the longest stretch since records began in 1959. It is having  a damaging effect on the country’s rivers and lakes, Mittelberger said, as well as the country’s soils. “Soils are much drier than usual,” he said. France’s current soil moisture levels would not normally be seen until mid-April. Snowfall has also been low. “The situation in the Pyrenees is close to the lowest record of snow quantity for that time of year,” Mittelberger said. The Alps have seen 63% less snow than usual, according to CIMA Research Foundation. A lack of snow in the winter can threaten water reserves in the spring and summer, as there is less snowmelt to sustain rivers. Last summer, France suffered its worst drought on record but, Mittelberger warned, this year “the situation could be worse if we don’t have significant rainfall in the next couple of months.” Christophe Béchu, the minister for ecological transition, called the winter drought “unprecedented,” and warned the country is in a state of alert. In Italy, some of country’s most famous bodies of water are drying up. Water levels at Lake Garda are so low that it is now possible to walk to an island in the middle, along a strip of exposed lake bed. A few months ago, this walkway did not exist. It is now also a lot harder to take a water taxi in Venice, as some of its canals have become too shallow to keep gondolas afloat, in part, because of a lack of rainfall. The city which has long feared flooding is now grappling with the opposite problem. Italy’s longest river, the Po, which winds through its northern agricultural heartland, has 61% less water than usual for this time of year. Last summer, the Italian government declared a state of emergency for the area surrounding the Po, which experienced its worst drought in 70 years. Giorgio Zampetti, general manager of Legambiente, an Italian environmental group, fears that the worst is yet to come: “2023 has just begun, but it is showing worrying signs in terms of extreme weather events [and] drought levels,” he said in a press statement. In Spain, which experienced its hottest year on record last year, there are concerns about water supplies. “We cannot guarantee water supply for drinking water or for economic uses by relying exclusively on rain,” Teresa Ribera, Minister for the Ecological Transition recently said at a press conference. The country has approved plans to invest around $24 billion in water management, including measures to improve sanitation and treatment and modernize irrigation. Since 1980 the average available water has decreased by 12%, with projections that there may be a further decrease of up to 40% by 2050. Dry weather in Spain is also threatening the country’s prized jamón ibérico bellota, as low rainfall and rising temperatures affect the acorns eaten by the pigs. While Europe has previously been blighted by summer droughts, experts fear the exceptionally dry last two months may signal a new reality, caused in part by rising average global temperatures. “These conditions were rare in the past, but climate change is altering precipitation regimes over Europe and making these extremes more recurrent and intense,” Andrea Toreti, a climatologist at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, told CNN. “There is a growing concern due to the lack of precipitation in the last weeks and also considering the 2022 drought. The coming weeks will be crucial,” Torerti said. While Toreti said attributing the winter drought to climate change would require a specific analysis that has not yet been conducted, he added such events “are an expected effect of climate change in terms of more frequent and intense extremes.”"

","Jessie Yeung, CNN","China is surging ahead with coal, a new report shows, rapidly approving and building new power plants despite its own promises to cut back on carbon as the world plunges ever deeper into the climate crisis. Last year, the country approved the highest number of new coal-fired power plants since 2015, according to the report, released Monday by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and the Global Energy Monitor (GEM). “China continues to be the glaring exception to the ongoing global decline in coal plant development,” said Flora Champenois, a research analyst at GEM. “The speed at which projects progressed through permitting to construction in 2022 was extraordinary, with many projects sprouting up, gaining permits, obtaining financing and breaking ground apparently in a matter of months,” she added. China’s emissions are more than double those of the United States, and though the country’s leaders have previously vowed to cut back on carbon, its reliance on coal poses a significant challenge. Throughout 2022, China granted permits for 106 gigawatts of capacity across 82 sites, quadruple the capacity approved in 2021 and equal to starting two large coal power plants each week, said the report. Last year, China experienced its worst heat wave and drought in six decades, dealing a blow to hydropower-reliant provinces -— and prompting authorities to turn toward coal instead. To ease the power crunch, coal plants boosted their output, with daily thermal coal consumption hitting a record high in August. 2021 wasn’t much better. Though Beijing had initially shut down hundreds of coal mines and pushed the remaining ones to curtail production, nationwide power shortages led the government to order mines to “produce as much coal as possible.” That push doesn’t appear to be ending anytime soon, with the report authors warning that even China’s simultaneous expansion in renewable energy won’t be enough to offset the impact. China added a record 125 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity last year, making up 2% of the country’s electricity demand. And though that target is even higher this year, “even this increase won’t be sufficient to supply all of the demand growth without increasing power generation from fossil fuels,” said the report. It added that for China to truly cut down on carbon emissions, it needs to start phasing out its “vast coal power plant fleet” rather than continue growing it. Besides the plants’ environmental impact, their “politically influential owners … have an interest in protecting their assets,” said the report. China and the United States are the world’s two biggest carbon emitters, with China’s emissions tripling over the past three decades, one report found in 2021. And though Chinese leader Xi Jinping had declared in 2020 that the country would become carbon neutral by 2060, activists and experts have said the government isn’t taking swift or decisive enough action. For instance, though China released a new plan in 2021 to cut its reliance on fossil fuels, it did not announce an updated emissions target.  Later that year, the emission-cutting plan it submitted to the United Nations drew disappointment from other world leaders who had hoped for significantly higher pledges and an accelerated decarbonization timeline. Xi himself softened his tone toward zero-carbon in the face of power outages, factory closures and compromised supply chains, saying early last year that “carbon peak and carbon neutrality cannot be realized overnight.” The country’s climate efforts have also been hampered by geopolitics, with China suspending climate talks with the United States last year in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan — dismaying activists, who say the two countries’ cooperation is crucial if the world is to avert climate catastrophe. Negotiations restarted months later at the UN’s COP27 summit in Egypt."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/27/us/hurricane-wind-damage-first-street-climate/index.html,Hurricane damage will increase in surprising new places in the coming decades. See where it’s trending higher,08/05/2024,"                                                 More people and properties will be exposed to damaging hurricane winds in the next 30 years, according to a new report from nonprofit organization First Street Foundation.                                             ","Ella Nilsen and Renée Rigdon, CNN","As the planet warms, hurricanes are changing – they are getting stronger faster, bringing more flooding rain, pushing farther inland after they make landfall and tracking farther north in general. Those changes are exposing more people and properties to hurricanes’ damaging winds, according to a new report from nonprofit organization First Street Foundation – with the potential to cause millions of dollars in damage in the coming decades. Importantly, the report lays out how homeowners’ financial loss from hurricane damage is likely to increase significantly in surprising new places, including the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The First Street analysis, which covers the next 30 years – or the typical life of a home mortgage – shows Florida and the Gulf Coast will continue to have the largest magnitude of financial loss from hurricane damage. But the future holds a significant uptick in damage for regions that previously have tended to be safer from the most devastating storms. For instance, First Street found the top 20 US cities with the highest likelihood of being hit with a major hurricane in 2023 are all in Florida. Over the next 30 years, though, New York City would see the largest percentage increase in average annual loss due to strong hurricanes, followed by Newport News, Virginia, and other coastal communities in the Mid-Atlantic. The report also highlights Southeast cities like Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, as notable future hot spots. “Hurricanes are making their way northward. They’re making it latitudinally up to places they haven’t before,” said Matthew Eby, founder and CEO of the First Street Foundation. “The second thing that comes along with that is they’re stronger.” First Street is known for analyzing flood risk that comes from more rainfall, rising seas and higher storm surge, but Eby said the group also wanted to capture how many properties were at risk to increased wind damage from stronger storms fueled by climate change – and where in the US they were. “We had half the story that comes from hurricanes with our flood model,” Eby said. “The other half of the story with hurricanes is the tremendous amount of wind force they have.” Human-caused climate change – which is warming the oceans and atmosphere – isn’t producing more hurricanes. But scientists have long said that it provides more fuel for stronger storms. The probability of a hurricane in the North Atlantic strengthening into a major storm – a category 3 or higher – has increased from 10% in the 1980s to 40% today, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “The odds of it being a major hurricane when it makes landfall are almost 50-50 now,” Eby told CNN. Even after it makes initial landfall, stronger and more-intact storms can persist longer over land, where they can dump incredible amounts of rain and bring high wind speeds to areas that aren’t prepared for them. First Street’s report also finds it more likely that hurricanes can form farther north, where communities are typically less resilient to hurricane-force winds than Miami or other Florida cities who are no stranger to these dangerous storms. “The South Carolina and Georgia border is where you’ll see the largest increase in wind speeds over the next 30 years,” Eby said. Charleston was hit hard by Hurricane Matthew in 2016; though the storm was just a category 1, its storm surge was significant for the South Carolina coast, pushing water levels 3 to 5 feet above normal. But it hasn’t had a truly devastating storm since Hurricane Hugo slammed into the city in 1989 as a category 4 with 140-mph winds and became the costliest disaster on record at the time. The area around the Georgia-South Carolina border has largely been spared from the worst hurricane landfalls because of the way the coastline bends inward. Most major hurricanes that strengthen in the Gulf of Mexico or warm waters of the Caribbean will hit another coast first – usually Florida. But that could change as storms strengthen farther north in the Atlantic. Hurricane models from prominent meteorologist and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Kerry Emanuel, which First Street used in its report, also show current and future hurricanes having a “tendency to form a little bit north in the Atlantic,” Emanuel told CNN. The problem, Emanuel and Eby said, is that stronger and more northward storms could be slamming into areas that haven’t yet established resiliency to hurricanes. The increase in hurricane wind speeds for Florida “will be fairly mild compared to the increases in the mid-Atlantic states and New England,” Emanuel told CNN. “In Miami, 100 mph wind is serious but not devastating because they’re used to it.” The problem with many hurricane models used by the government, insurance companies and banks to assess risk is that they’re out of date and lack sufficient historical data, according to Emanuel. “The bottom line is the models that are being used by the existing [catastrophe] modeling industry are based strictly on historical statistics,” Emanuel told CNN. “The historical record isn’t very long, and it isn’t very good when you get back to before 1970.” The other issue is that hurricane models aren’t good at taking climate change into account. Emanuel developed his own physics-based model of present and future hurricanes that has tracked recent major storms accurately and which First Street used to create its report. “This is a big deal for the insurance companies, and they’ve woken up recently to this,” Emanuel said. “The estimates of risk they use to price properties and premiums are 50 years out of date, and the climate has changed enough to make their data useless.” Part of First Street’s design is to provide this data for individual homeowners to help make their homes safer and more resilient to storms. But Eby and Emanuel said they hope it is also used by the government and financial and insurance companies to either make communities more resilient or move them to areas that are safer. “We’re really hopeful that our data can do that, to have the risk illuminated for them to make the right decisions,” Eby said. “Now they’re armed with that data, they can make those smart decisions. That’s really the hope.”"

","Nouran Salahieh and Joe Sutton, CNN","Communities on the West Coast and in the Northeast are dealing with heavy snowfall, strong winds, power outages and dangerous road conditions from a series of storms lashing opposite sides of the US. About 23 million people are under winter weather alerts across the country Tuesday. Some alerts remain in place in the Northeast as snow continues to fall across interior portions of New York and New England. But most are for areas in the West – including blizzard warnings for the Sierras – while a powerful storm is bringing heavy snow at lower elevations including the Portland and Seattle areas. In Southern California, some residents of mountain communities were left stranded as snow-covered roads became too dangerous to navigate. In the East, a storm that has already brought tornadoes, damaging winds and hail to the central US is moving north. The system will spread further into northern New England on Tuesday as cold air moves over the region and brings 4 to 8 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service. New York City is no longer under any winter weather alerts after it recorded its biggest snow event of a nearly snowless season. Central Park recorded 1.8 inches of snow from the storm by 7 a.m. Tuesday, bringing the total for this winter to 2.2 inches. That’s the lowest seasonal snowfall on record for the park, which is more than 2 feet below its normal seasonal snowfall. Areas outside the city got between 2 and 4 inches of snow overnight and could get up to 6 inches by the time the system moves out. The snow will continue falling throughout the day in upstate New York and parts of New England, with widespread totals up to 8 inches possible and some isolated areas getting even more. In Rhode Island, where Gov. Daniel McKee warned of a difficult morning commute, all Providence schools were closed Tuesday. Connecticut also announced closures of schools in Hartford as well as all state office buildings as the state readied for a significant snowstorm to come through that could bring heavy snowfall of 5 to 7 inches and isolated amounts up to 10 inches. South of the freeze line, Philadelphia is forecast to see rainy conditions Tuesday. More than 210,000 homes and businesses across the US were without power Tuesday, mainly in Michigan and California, according to PowerOutage.us. On the West Coast, back-to-back winter storms have left some residents in Southern California’s San Bernardino County stranded since last week with dwindling supplies of food and fuel, officials said. The county declared a local emergency Monday after several feet of snow left mountain roads nearly impassable. “Residents of mountain communities found themselves trapped at home or unable to reach home due to several feet of snow that fell over the weekend, with more to follow during the next several days,” a news release from the county said. Crews have been working to create single-lane pathways for first responders but are seeking state and federal assistance clearing the snow, the news release said. In Blue Jay, in the San Bernardino Mountains, Lisa Griggs walks 20-30 minutes through several feet of snow to get to the nearest grocery store, she told CNN. On Monday, the manager told her the store was running low on food, she said. Rick Varikian was visiting his sister in Blue Jay when he got stuck there by the snow with three other adult family members and six children, he told CNN. “My car doesn’t work and there’s no fuel at all,” Varikian said. “There’s 10 of us right now in the house and we’re running low on food.” “We’re getting to the end of where we can be comfortable just feeding our child,” a Crestline, California, resident told CNN affiliate KCBS/KCAL. “It’s frustrating.” Both Griggs and Varikian are hoping help will make its way up the mountain soon. “We need manpower. We can’t do this by ourselves. We’re not used to this much snow. Thank god we still have electricity and internet so we can at least communicate and let the people know what’s going on up here,” Griggs said. More than 600 Orange County middle school students were among those stuck in the San Bernardino mountains after getting snowed in while attending camps last week. The students were supposed to return home Friday but were stranded over the weekend until the California Highway Patrol escorted buses down the mountain so they could reunite with their families, according to an Irvine Unified School District spokeswoman. Two more rounds of heavy snow are expected in the Sierra Nevada and Northern California over the next few days, with snowfall rates over 2 inches per hour and wind gusts up to 60 mph forecast, the weather service said. In the higher mountain ranges, snowfall amounts over a foot are likely. An avalanche warning is in effect through Wednesday morning for the central Sierra Nevada, including the Lake Tahoe area. Heavy snow will make it as far east as the Colorado Rockies and as far south as northern Arizona, bringing hazardous travel conditions Tuesday and Wednesday, the weather service said. Snow and wind will combine in the Sierra Nevada to create blizzard conditions and make travel “very dangerous to impossible,” the weather service warned. “If you plan to travel by road at elevations above 1,000 feet through West Coast states, be prepared for rapidly changing conditions and have winter driving supplies,” the service said. Interstate 80 at the California-Nevada state line was closed Monday night due to whiteout conditions. California Highway Patrol in Truckee tweeted that officers were responding to drivers stuck in snow all day Tuesday, warning drivers not to try to drive I-80 over Donner Summit. “Travel conditions are extremely dangerous with zero visibility and blizzard conditions! Stay home and don’t put your life in danger!!,” CHP said. In Oregon, a section of the 5 Freeway was closed, with the weather service there warning that patchy blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. With the risk of getting trapped in a car on a snowy road a reality, officials are urging those who venture onto the roads to be prepared. “Bring chains and know how to use them. Bring an emergency kit that includes warm clothes, snacks and water in case you are delayed. Make sure your vehicle is ready with good tires and working wiper blades,” the Oregon Department of Transportation said. At least 11 school districts in northwest Oregon were closed due to heavy snow and winter weather warnings. As the Northeast and West Coast prepare for more snow, residents in Central US are recovering from tornadoes and severe winds. The central US tallied 14 tornado reports Sunday – including nine in Oklahoma – and another five in Illinois on Monday. In Oklahoma, the storm ripped roofs off homes, flipped cars, downed trees and littered neighborhoods with debris. As many as 12 people have been reported injured in the state. There were 185 storm reports Sunday across the Southern Plains, mainly of strong winds across Kansas, Texas and Oklahoma. That number includes 15 tornado reports and 15 hail reports, with several hailstones reportedly 1.75 inches in diameter. Weather experts will work to determine whether the system can be classified as a derecho, a widespread, long-lived windstorm, which typically causes damage in one direction across a relatively straight path. CNN’s Taylor Romine, Robert Shackleford and Caroll Alvarado contributed to this report."

There continues to be potential for avalanches in some mountain ranges,” the weather service said. Many areas in California have been walloped with significant amounts of snow in recent days, an unusual occurrence for a state that’s unaccustomed to harsh winters. Palisades Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada saw 38 inches of snow in a 24-hour period, while Soda Springs, the Central Sierra Snow Lab and Homewood Mountain were each lashed with 36 inches. The winter weather is impacting utility systems in the state, with more than 98,000 homes and businesses without power Wednesday, the tracking site PowerOutage.us showed. The storm will also bring up to 0.75 inches of rain across the coast and valleys of Southern California on Wednesday and up to 2 inches in the mountains and foothills. As temperatures drop and rain hits the ground, black ice is forecast to be a significant concern in some higher elevations, the weather service in Los Angeles said. Wind gusts up to 60 mph are possible in mountain areas and gusts up to 50 mph are possible in lower elevations, the local weather service added. In Nevada, several roads were closed due to heavy snow, including parts of state roads 164, 16 and 160, according to officials there. The system will slowly move into the Four Corners region by late Wednesday and will continue to track across Arizona and New Mexico into Thursday. The region could see 5 to 10 inches of snow in lower elevations and up to 2 feet in isolated areas across higher elevations. As the series of storms that have dropped snow in the West head east and clash with record warm temperatures, they will create a threat for severe weather through the end of the week. More than 3 million people, including those in Memphis, Tennessee, and Little Rock, Arkansas, are under a Level 3 of 5 risk for severe storms Wednesday, including tornadoes, the Storm Prediction Center said. The main threats are large to very large hail, some tornadoes and damaging winds. A tornado watch is in effect for northeast Texas, southeast Oklahoma, central and southern Arkansas, northern Mississippi and southwest Tennessee Wednesday afternoon, according to the Storm Prediction Center. The watch, which lasts until 10 p.m. CST, covers more than 4 million people, including the cities of Little Rock and Memphis. More than 35 million people are under some level of threat as storms continue to develop across the South on Wednesday afternoon and night. Eastern Arkansas, northern Alabama, northern Mississippi and much of Tennessee could see rain fall at rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour, with totals between 2 and 4 inches. Thunderstorms are expected to develop across northeast Texas on Wednesday afternoon and spread across portions of Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee and Mississippi. Tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail will be possible from later Wednesday afternoon until well after dark across the region. A severe thunderstorm outbreak looks to be taking shape for Thursday across the Southern Plains and South, according to the prediction center. The main concerns are possible strong tornadoes, widespread damaging winds and flash flooding. As the snow has been piling up in California, mountain roads across San Bernardino County became impassable, leading to a local emergency declaration as residents became stranded while low on supplies and food. The San Bernardino County Fire Department carried out almost 100 rescues in the snow crisis, according to Fire Chief Dan Munsey. “We’re responding to medical calls. We’re responding to fires in these trapped vehicles. We are going to people’s houses where they’ve had trees through their houses or some sort of roof collapse and we are evacuating them to our evacuation shelters,” Munsey said at a news conference Wednesday. Goodwin’s Market, a grocery store in the small community of Crestline, resorted to using a plow truck and tractor to help a semitruck hauling supplies navigate through the snowy mountain roads Tuesday so it could deliver much-needed supplies, according to a post on its Facebook page. The shipment was imperative to the store because it contained essential items like deli meats, produce and bread, some of which the store had run out of, Michael Johnstone, vice president of Goodwin’s Market, told CNN. “We stocked up pretty heavily before the storm hit,” Johnstone said, adding the supply began to run low as roads deteriorated. As the snow continued to fall, staff and customers were forced to ditch their vehicles to reach the store. “We have had staff hike in from three to four miles away to get to the store to serve people to make sure people get fed,” Johnstone added. “We had a lot of walk-in traffic. I’ve never seen this many people walking the streets.” To the north, in Sacramento, about 50 bus passengers were stranded Tuesday night after their trips were canceled or delayed because heavy snow had shut down highways, according to Daniel Bowers, who heads the city’s emergency management office. Passengers were headed to Nevada, Oregon and Washington, Bowers told CNN affiliate KCRA. Passenger Barbara Frederick was trying to get to Oregon, but she had been stranded at the Sacramento station since the weekend. “It’s horrible,” Frederick told KCRA. “I have to delay the signing of my house because I’m purchasing a home. I’m delaying work. I’m delaying everything. My life is completely on hold.” The city collaborated with the American Red Cross to provide stranded passengers with blankets and other needs, and contacted a local restaurant to offer hot meals, the station reported. CNN’s Amanda Jackson, Nouran Salahieh and Taylor Ward contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","While global car sales might have fallen in 2022, one type of car, with an especially large climate footprint, had a great year: The SUV. Last year sports utility vehicles accounted for nearly half of all cars sold, with particular growth in the US, India and Europe, according to the International Energy Agency. This boom comes at a climate cost. The amount of planet-heating carbon pollution produced by the 330 million SUVs now on the world’s roads rose to around 1 billion tons in 2022. To put that in perspective, if SUVs were a country, they would easily be in the top 10 world’s highest carbon-polluters. There was some good news for electric cars. While car markets in general shrunk due to factors including supply chain shortages and inflation, electric cars bucked the trend. Last year, global electric car sales rose by about 60%, exceeding 10 million for the first time, according to the IEA. More than a quarter of cars sold in China were electric, one in five in the European Union and nearly one in 10 in the US. However, the big increase in electric cars was not enough to offset the growing carbon-pollution impact of SUVs, the majority of which are gas-powered. These heavier vehicles are less fuel efficient than smaller cars, on average consuming about 20% more fuel than the average medium-sized car, according to the IEA. While the number of electric SUVs is increasing – last year they made up more than half of global electric car sales and 16% of total SUV sales – they also come with problems. Their bigger batteries require more materials such as cobalt, copper, lithium and nickel, which adds to pressure on supply chains. “Carmakers are culling small cars in pursuit of profit,” Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility at Transport & Environment, told CNN by email. “But larger cars put more pressure on the planet as they need more materials and energy,” she added. “For drivers, this means more expensive models and higher running costs, especially at a time of high energy prices. Ultimately, Western carmakers might come to regret this,” Poliscanova said. The IEA called for or car makers to decrease the average car size and invest in battery technologies. “Rapidly increasing the number of electric cars on the road in place of conventional cars is a key part of reaching net zero emissions by mid-century,” it said."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/willow-project-petition-concessions-biden-climate/index.html,Climate advocates are rallying against the Willow Project. The White House is eyeing concessions to soften the blow,03/03/2023,                                                 Climate advocates and young voters have rallied on social media against the Willow Project and are circulating a a Change.org petition that has more than 1.6 million signatures.                                             ,"Ella Nilsen, CNN","With just days to go until the Biden administration is set to a release a decision on the first major oil drilling project of its tenure, the White House has indicated it may reduce the scope of the controversial project that has drawn fierce criticism from climate advocates. The Willow Project, proposed by ConocoPhillips, is a massive and decades-long oil drilling venture on Alaska’s North Slope that the state’s lawmakers say will create jobs and boost domestic energy production. Its supporters say Willow could be a much-needed new source of revenue for the region. But environmental groups have remained staunchly opposed to it, fearing the effect of the planet-warming carbon pollution from the hundreds of millions of barrels of oil it would produce. Young voters have rallied on social media against the proposal with the hashtag #StopWillow in posts that have amassed tens of millions of views. A petition to “say no the willow project” on Change.org has more than 1.6 million signatures and continues to grow. They say the approval of Willow will deal a significant blow to President Joe Biden’s climate credibility after he pledged in his campaign to end new oil drilling on federal land. By the administration’s own estimates, the project would generate enough oil to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon pollution a year – equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads. Over the course of 30 years, climate groups have estimated it would release around 278 million metric tons of carbon pollution, which is more than what 70 coal-fired power plants could produce every year. In a move to assuage the criticism, the Biden administration is looking at reducing the number of approved drilling pads from three to two and offering to boost nature conservation measures elsewhere in the state, according to two sources familiar with the details of the plan. White House officials are considering cutting the most ecologically sensitive drill site of the three, one source said. And in a final environmental impact statement, the administration described how it would plant trees to mitigate carbon emissions from the project and move some drilling infrastructure to protect local loon habitat. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the discussions. A final decision on Willow is expected next week. The concessions are not going over well with environmental groups – while at the same time enraging Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation. “I don’t see people rejoicing in the climate community over any amount of drill pads being opened up in the petroleum reserve,” one climate advocate who has been engaged with the White House in recent weeks told CNN. On Wednesday, Alaska’s Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, and Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, the first Alaska Native in Congress, slammed the idea of reducing drill pads to appease environmental groups. “If they go to two pads, we have told them we will view it 100% as a full denial,” Sullivan said. “Conoco has made it clear it would not be economically viable, and we have warned the White House: Don’t try to be cute.” No matter where the administration ultimately lands on the massive oil project, it could face lawsuits from multiple sides that could hold the project up further. ConocoPhillips could pursue legal options if the drill pad sites are reduced. ConocoPhillips spokesperson Dennis Nuss said the company is waiting to see a final decision on the project before it shares next steps. Environmental legal group Earthjustice has been preparing a lawsuit against the project if it is approved. That won’t change – even if the number of drilling pads is reduced – said Jeremy Lieb, a senior attorney for Earthjustice. “I think that litigation is very likely,” Lieb, who is based in Alaska, told CNN. “We and our clients don’t see any acceptable version of this project.” For climate groups that have been celebrating monumental wins in Congress under Biden, the Willow project represents a galvanizing moment of a different kind. The League of Conservation Voters last month launched six-figure television and digital ad campaign urging Biden to reject Willow. LCV’s senior vice president of government affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld told CNN her group is not negotiating with the Biden administration for a reduced number of drill pads; they still want to see the project canceled. “It clearly flies in the face of both his incredible climate accomplishments to date and his goal of cutting climate pollution in half by 2030,” Sittenfeld said. “Such significant swaths of the coalition that supports him are deeply opposed, and we’re seeing that this is incredibly galvanizing for young people.” And activism against the project has surged on social media, with 50 million direct views of #StopWillow videos on TiKTok alone in recent weeks. Climate advocates say that as Biden gears up for the 2024 election, a decision to approve Willow could risk alienating a base of young voters. It could also galvanize a widespread movement against a new fossil fuel project, like the resistance to the Keystone XL pipeline during the Obama administration. “There’s a specific thing happening in a physical place; I think it makes it feel more real,” said Jamal Raad, co-founder and executive director for climate and clean energy group Evergreen Action. “I do not see one new voter for the Biden administration for approving the largest American oil extraction on public lands.” The politics of the huge Alaska drilling project are messy – both inside and outside the Biden administration. The Willow project has been under consideration since the Trump administration, which initially planned on approving it with a larger scope. The Biden administration has pursued the project with a smaller footprint. It has sparked controversy even within the administration; when the Bureau of Land Management in Alaska released its preferred alternative of three drill pads last month, the US Department of the Interior put out a statement saying it had “substantial concerns” with the project, “including direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and impacts to wildlife and Alaska Native subsistence.” Alaska Natives are divided on the project. While the project has been largely opposed by the nearby Alaska Native village of Nuiqsut – which some villagers evacuated last year during a gas leak from another ConocoPhillips project in the area – it has garnered support from other Alaska Native tribes and officials who want the jobs and revenue the project could bring to the North Slope, which could boost the basic services for people that live there. Nagruk Harcharek, president of the advocacy group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, said Tuesday the project has “majority consensus” among Alaska Natives on the North Slope. “We utilize the jobs that projects like this provide,” he said. “[They] provide income for the families on the North Slope” Harcharek also said he doesn’t believe the project would negatively affect subsistence hunting for animals, including whale and caribou. “As the subsistence hunters of the North Slope, we would not support a project that threatened our subsistence livelihood,” Harcharek said, adding that subsistence hunting and resource development “are not mutually exclusive.” “When you talk about environmental justice and protecting the environment, us Alaska natives are part of that environment,” Alaska state Rep. Josiah Patkotak, who has no party affiliation, said on Tuesday. “We’re asking the president, his Cabinet, all those involved in the decision-making process to keep that in mind.” A final decision on the project is expected next week. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre last month said the final decision on Willow rests with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. But ultimately, environmental advocates and lawmakers like Murkowski told CNN they believe the White House – not Interior – will make the final decision on whether to approve Willow. Peltola, Murkowski and Sullivan have been asking White House staff to meet with Biden directly about the project, Murkowski told CNN – a meeting request that so far has not been added to the president’s calendar. Murkowski told CNN that if that happens after a Willow decision is released, “That’s pretty rude, I think.” “It’s not any great state secret that I have been a cooperative Republican with this administration,” Murkowski told CNN. “Cooperation goes both ways.” This story has been updated with more information."

","Jack Guy, CNN","The world’s most northerly forests could be a “time bomb” of planet-warming pollution as expanding wildfires have released record high levels of planet-heating pollution into the atmosphere, according to a new study. Using new satellite data analysis techniques, researchers found that, since 2000, summer wildfires have expanded in boreal forests, which wrap around the northernmost parts of the Earth. Boreal forest fires usually make up 10% of global wildfire-related carbon pollution. But in 2021, their contribution soared to 23%, according to the study, as extreme drought and heatwaves in Siberia and Canada helped drive intense fires. “Boreal forests could be a time bomb of carbon, and the recent increases in wildfire emissions we see make me worry the clock is ticking,” said study author Steven Davis, a professor of earth system science at the University of California at Irvine, in a press release. These forests, which cover huge swaths of Canada, Russia and Alaska, are the world’s largest land biome. They are also carbon dense, releasing 10 to 20 times more planet-heating carbon pollution for each unit of area burned by wildfires than other ecosystems, according to the study. Boreal forests are one of the fastest warming biomes on Earth, and warmer and drier fire seasons are contributing to expanding wildfires. Russia’s Siberian region experienced particularly bad wildfires in 2021 which burned nearly 45 million acres (18.16 million hectares) of Russian forest in 2021. In July that year, reconnaissance pilot Svyatoslav Kolesov told CNN he couldn’t fly his plane in the far eastern Russian region of Yukutia because smoke from the fires was so thick. The region is prone to wildfires and much of the land is covered in forests, but Kolesov said something has changed. “New fires have appeared in the north of Yakutia, in places where there were no fires last year and where it had not burned at all before,” he said. Wildfires are becoming larger and more intense and they are also happening in places that aren’t used to such extreme fires. The situation is likely to worsen as temperatures rise, study author Bo Zheng, an assistant professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, told CNN via email. Higher temperatures encourage the growth of vegetation, which then becomes exceptionally dry during heatwaves, increasing the risk of wildfires. “We are facing dangerous positive feedback between climate and boreal fires,” Zheng said. “Heatwaves and droughts are likely to occur more frequently over the boreal region, and the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires like those in 2021 are likely to increase, with the release of CO2 emissions in turn leading to further global warming,” he added. Jeff Wells, the vice president for boreal conservation at the conservation organization National Audubon Society, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that he was not surprised that the study had found such a high level of carbon pollution from boreal fires. But, he said, “the size of the spike in 2021 is shocking.” The findings are “yet another stark warning” of the need to “drastically reduce CO2 emissions,” Wells said. Wells also pointed to the role Indigenous communities play in protecting forests and peatlands. “It is time the world recognizes the leadership and knowledge of Indigenous peoples and their governments in the boreal and across the world in stewarding their traditional territories, especially in the face of the increase in the size and frequency of wildfires,” said Wells."

But don’t get too used to the warmer weather. We could see a huge shift in temperatures next week, and this one won’t be subtle.                                             ","Jennifer Gray, CNN Meteorologist","Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. For the last several weeks, high temperatures have been breaking records. Many of you may have kissed winter goodbye and already moved on to spring. But don’t get too used to the warmer weather. We could see a huge shift in temperatures next week, and this one won’t be subtle. The Climate Prediction Center is calling for below-average temperatures for much of the country beginning this weekend and lasting for much of next week, and possibly beyond. The cold snap could bring snow as far south as the southern Appalachians next week and bring snow into the mid-Atlantic. There’s even a shot of snow for Washington, DC, where some cherry blossoms around the capital are already blooming. Areas seeing little to no snow this winter could make up for some of the deficit during winter’s final breath. There may be some potential for some snow. “I’m cautiously optimistic for snow lovers for snow to potentially be across the mid-Atlantic and other areas that haven’t seen really any snow at all,” Jon Gottschalk, Branch Chief at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. While the exact temperatures and impacts are still being fine-tuned, the Climate Prediction Center is calling for the Southeast to feel the pendulum swing the most. They are calling for temperatures to run at least 15 degrees below normal, which comes on the heels of temperatures running 15 to 25 degrees above normal during a record warm February. Here are a few cities that experienced their top five warmest meteorological winters (December 1, 2022, through February 28, 2023): The warm weather has reached far and wide this year. Aside from the West, who has been experiencing a historic cold and snowy winter, much of the country has been oddly warm. “Much of the cold has been kept bottled up in the Arctic for much of this year so far, but that appears to be changing and most people in the US will feel it later this week,” CNN senior meteorologist Brandon Miller explained. “On the positive side, there just isn’t as cold of air in March left to invade the US and bring too much in the way of a deep freeze, like what we saw in late-December.” The Tennessee Valley will get hit with a big temperature swing, going from the 80s last week to highs in the 40s next week. We could see several mornings with temperatures below freezing, which is a huge concern for agriculture. “The main impact that we’re concerned with is the vegetation or potential crop losses, if it does come to fruition, because we do expect freezing temperatures to reach pretty far south,” Gottschalk said. Rusty Mangrum is one of those farmers. He grows hundreds of thousands of plants every year, including fruit trees at his nursery in McMinnville, Tennessee. His trees, like most in the South and mid-South, already think it’s spring. “A lot of trees are blooming out because of the warm temperatures,” Mangrum said. He says if the temperature drop does materialize, they have a lot to lose. “When we get a cold spell below freezing, it will end up killing the blooms, and it won’t produce fruit that year. So, you’ve lost a year’s worth of fruit really,” Mangrum explained. He said his plants could still produce fruit if the cold snap is short-lived, but if the cold lasts more than a day, it could not only be trouble for the farmers, but for the consumers as well. Keep up with the latest forecast here We will keep watching the forecast and the cold weather ahead, but in the meantime, we have a few more days of warm temperatures. “Highs are expected to soar into the 70s this afternoon as far north as the Ohio Valley, with 80s across the Deep South and southern Plains,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “These warm temperatures could break several daily record highs.” By midweek, heavy rain will fall across the southern Plains. We could see showers and thunderstorms from North Texas to Arkansas. The rain is expected to linger for much of the week, due to a stalled frontal boundary. “This will lead to the chances for scattered flash floods, particularly over parts of central/eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas on Tuesday night,” said the prediction center. Much of the Northeast and New England so far has experienced an unusually quiet winter season (aside from areas around the Great Lakes). However, it is all changing this week. CNN Meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this story."

","Tara Subramaniam, CNN","Parts of Asia’s largest cities could be under water by 2100 thanks to rising sea levels, according to a new study that combines both the impact of climate change with natural oceanic fluctuations. Sea levels have already been on the rise due to increasing ocean temperatures and unprecedented levels of ice melting caused by climate change. But a report published in the journal Nature Climate Change offers fresh insight and stark warnings about how bad the impact could be for millions of people. While many shoreline Asian megacities were already at risk of flooding, the study suggests that previous analysis underestimated the degree of sea level rise and subsequent flooding caused by natural ocean fluctuations. Since natural fluctuations have a high degree of variability, their impact is hard to quantify. But the study showed that with the maximum possible impact from natural fluctuations combined with the expected consequences of climate change, several Southeast Asian megacities would become new hotspots of high sea-level rise. In the Philippine capital Manila, for example, the study predicts that coastal flooding events within the next century will occur 18 times more often than before, solely because of climate change. But factoring in naturally-occurring fluctuations in sea level increases the frequency of coastal flooding up to 96 times more often than before, the study found. Lourdes Tibig, a climate science adviser for the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities in the Philippines, said the study’s findings underscore the urgency of addressing climate change. “The world needs to act on climate change with far more urgency and ambition to protect the millions living in our coastal megacities,” Tibig said. Manila, where more than 13 million people live, is far from alone. The study, conducted by scientists at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the University of La Rochelle in France and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the United States (NCAR), found that Thailand’s capital Bangkok, Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City and Yangon, Myanmar are particularly at risk, along with Chennai and Kolkata in India, some western tropical Pacific islands and the western Indian Ocean. The rise in sea level along the west coasts of the United States and Australia would also increase, the study suggested. Across the Asian megacities alone, more than 50 million people could be affected by the higher than expected rise in sea levels – nearly 30 million of them in India. Bangkok is home to at least 11 million people, Ho Chi Minh City more than 9 million and Yangon around 5.6 million. The sea level changes detailed in the report are not likely to take effect until the end of the 21st century. However, if the pace of greenhouse gas emissions increases, the threat becomes more imminent, the authors warned. NCAR scientist Aixue Hu, one of the study’s authors, said policy makers and the general public alike should be concerned about these potential threats. “From a policy perspective, we have to prepare for the worst,” Hu said. According to a NCAR news release, the study found that naturally occurring events such as El Niño, a weather phenomenon known to leave much of the West Pacific, Australia and Asia warmer than usual, could amplify the anticipated sea level rise due to climate change by 20-30%, which also increases the risk of extreme flooding events. Climate change has already triggered unprecedented extreme flooding in the Asia-Pacific region within the last year. An analysis by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service described 2022 as “a year of climate extremes,” including deadly floods in Pakistan and widespread flooding in Australia. At the same time, ocean temperatures are the highest they’ve ever been and expected to continue increasing. A January report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted that ocean temperatures were at a record high last year, surpassing the previous record set in 2021. The past four years have been the warmest four on record for the planet’s oceans. “And unfortunately, we’re predicting that 2023 will actually be warmer than 2022,” Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist at NASA, said in January."

","Taylor Ward, CNN Meteorologist","The threat of flooding later this week continues to increase across much of California. The Weather Prediction Center now has a Level 3 of 4, moderate risk, for excessive rainfall late Thursday and Friday. Not only is this event quite strong, but is also much warmer than recent storms, which will cause significant rain on top of a heavy snowpack for many. The late-week event, known as an atmospheric river, is forecast to be a Category 4 out of 5, according to the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. “Unlike several of the previous events into the West Coast, this atmospheric river will have a tropical connection that will advect prodigious amounts of both Pacific moisture and also sub-tropical warmth into California,” the prediction center said. “Thus, snow levels are expected to rise well above the levels seen in previous events.” “A much stronger, wetter, and warmer storm system will impact all of Central California Thursday night into Saturday night,” the National Weather Service in Hanford said. “Excessive rainfall below 8,000 feet and rapid snow melt from 2,000 feet to 5,000 feet may result in flooding.” The incredible snowpack over California complicates the forecast flood threat from the heavy rain. “The uncertainty lies in how much rainfall will be absorbed by the snowpack before there is significant release of that water into the rivers,” the prediction center said. “It’s likely some of the (precipitation) will simply be absorbed into the many feet of snow at the highest elevations, but lower elevations, generally below 5,000 ft, appear most likely to not have the snowpack necessary to absorb the multiple inches of rainfall expected.” “It’s also worth mentioning that while not flooding related, the heavy rain falling into the deep snowpack will result in rapid increases in the weight of the snow on the roofs of buildings, increasing the threat of roof collapses,” the prediction center warns. “Affected communities are urged to remove the existing snow from their roofs to mitigate this.” Flash flood watches have been issued for much of northern and central California, including San Francisco and Sacramento and cover more than 16 million people. The National Weather Service is forecasting widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 4  inches, with isolated amounts of up to 8 inches. The Monterey County Office of Emergency Services is urging its residents and businesses who are located in Big Sur “to begin stocking up with at least 2 weeks of essential supplies” in anticipation of an atmospheric river weather event that will impact the region this week. “The National Weather Service (NWS) is predicting that a strong weather system, stronger than recent systems, may arrive late Thursday of this week lasting several days. Current hydrographic estimates have all rivers rising, with the Big Sur River reaching ‘action stage’ and other Monterey County rivers getting close to ‘action stage’ by the weekend,” the news release from the county said. The Big Sur area is roughly 150 miles south of San Francisco. The county went on to say “this is a preliminary notice in an effort to provide Monterey County residents and Big Sur residents, in particular, ample time to prepare.” CNN has reached out to county officials for additional details on preparations. A flood watch has been issued for the county, according to the National Weather Service’s San Francisco office. Marin County officials are preparing for this week’s anticipated atmospheric river. “At this point, we are monitoring expected rainfall both timing and amounts. Our reservoirs are all full from storms earlier this year. With reservoirs full we expect our creeks will rise more rapidly with most of the rain becoming runoff,” Marin County Fire Chief Jason Weber told CNN. The chief added, “We will up-staff and pre-position water rescue resources and add additional staffing as we get closer based on forecasts.” Weber said one of the state’s 10 regional Urban Search & Rescue Task Forces is located in the county and will be available to deploy to other counties if they are experiencing significant impacts from the storm system. The US&R Task Force is comprised of 29 people specially trained and equipped for large or complex urban search and rescue operations, the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services website says. A flood watch has been issued for the county beginning Thursday afternoon into Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Marin County is about 20 miles north of San Francisco. CNN’s Joe Sutton contributed to this report."

","Allison Chinchar and Brandon Miller, CNN Meteorologists","After three consecutive years of an unusually stubborn pattern, La Niña has officially ended and El Niño is on the way, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday. That could mean a less active Atlantic hurricane season, a more active season in the Pacific – and another spike in global temperatures, forecasters say. El Niño is associated with a band of warm ocean water that forms in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, which has consequences for weather patterns around the globe. NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center said “neutral conditions” are in place now and are expected to last through early summer in the Northern Hemisphere for the first time since the initial La Niña advisory was issued in September 2020. The prediction center also wrote its forecast now favors “El Niño forming during summer 2023 and persisting through the fall.” The transition to El Niño during the later summer months could have major influence over the Atlantic and Pacific hurricane seasons. “Tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic is more sensitive to El Niño influences than in any other ocean basin,” NOAA said. Generally, El Niño reduces Atlantic hurricane activity, but has the opposite result in the Pacific, where warmer waters can produce more intense hurricanes. The warmer the Pacific Ocean is, especially in the eastern region, tropical cyclone quantity and strength can tend to increase. The Atlantic, however, sees fewer hurricanes as a result of increased upper-level winds that prevent hurricanes from developing. El Niño also significantly impacts California’s weather and could mean a continuation of the current wet pattern already plaguing the state. Traditionally, El Niño brings increased rain and snow across the Golden State, especially in the cool season, leading to flooding, landslides, and coastal erosion. “Southern California is generally much more impacted with El Nino conditions bringing higher than normal precipitation,” the National Weather Service in Sacramento, California said. But having a very robust La Niña winter could still have lingering effects this summer even as we transition into more of an El Niño pattern. “Even though La Niña is coming to an end we are likely to see latent impacts for some time to come and therefore some of the … rainfall impacts of La Niña may still continue,” the World Meteorological Organization said. “The lingering impacts of multi-year La Niña is basically due to its long duration, and continuous circulation anomaly, which are different from the single-peak La Niña event.” That’s a cause for concern for many Californians, given the surplus of moisture across the state in the past two months. The more widespread concern with the return to El Niño conditions for the first time since the summer of 2019 will be the warming ocean’s impact on global temperatures and heat waves. “If we do now enter an El Niño phase, this is likely to fuel another spike in global temperatures,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. In fact, 2022 was the warmest La Niña on record, and adding the additional heat of El Niño means the next year or two will likely climb even higher on the list of hottest years on record. “La Niña’s cooling effect put a temporary brake on rising global temperatures, even though the past eight-year period was the warmest on record,” said Taalas. El Niño and La Niña are major drivers of Earth’s climate patterns, but not the only ones. The North Atlantic Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole are also have influence and are taken into account for the WMO’s global seasonal climate updates. The change in La Niña and El Niño patterns contributes to a widespread prediction of above-normal temperatures over land areas, according to those updates. “The El Niño and La Niña phenomenon occurs naturally,” the WMO said. “But it is taking place against a background of human-induced climate change, which is increasing global temperatures, affecting seasonal rainfall patterns, and making our weather more extreme.”"

",Story by Reuters,"European Union countries agreed to promote a global fossil fuel phase out on Thursday ahead of the United Nation’s COP28 climate summit this year, attempting to boost a global deal that failed at last year’s summit. Ministers from the 27 EU member states approved a text on their diplomatic priorities ahead of the COP28 summit, which begins on November 30 in Dubai, where nearly 200 countries will attempt to strengthen efforts to rein in climate change. “The shift towards a climate neutral economy will require the global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels,” the EU text said, citing the scientific consensus that this is necessary to avoid more severe climate change. “The EU will systematically promote and call for a global move towards energy systems free of unabated fossil fuels well ahead of 2050”, it said, adding that global fossil fuel consumption should peak in the near term. Europe is in the midst of transforming its energy system to meet climate targets and end decades of reliance on Russian fossil fuels. The text said countries should combine the two aims and use renewable energy or energy savings - rather than fossil fuels – to replace Russian energy. “There is no need for a one-to-one replacement of former Russian natural gas import volumes,” it said. Some countries are hoping this year’s COP28 summit could secure a global deal to phase out fossil fuels, which emit planet-heating pollution. They want this to include not only coal, as agreed at previous UN climate talks, but also oil and gas. More than 80 countries, including the EU, supported an Indian proposal to do this at last year’s summit, but Saudi Arabia and other oil and gas-rich nations opposed it. EU countries approved their climate text two weeks later than planned, owing to a spat among countries over whether it should promote nuclear energy. The final version scrubbed some wording that countries had disagreed on, but said that alongside renewable energy, EU diplomacy will promote sustainable “low-carbon technologies” - a phrase that often refers to nuclear energy."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Scientists have set out a way to suck planet-heating carbon pollution from the air, turn it into sodium bicarbonate and store it in oceans, according to a new paper. The technique could be up to three times more efficient than current carbon capture technology, say the authors of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. Tackling the climate crisis means drastically reducing the burning of fossil fuels, which releases planet-heating pollution. But because humans have already pumped so much of this pollution into the atmosphere and are unlikely to sufficiently reduce emissions in the near term, scientists say we also need to remove it from the air. Nature does this – forests and oceans, for example, are valuable carbon sinks – but not quickly enough to keep pace with the amounts humans are producing. So we have turned to technology. One method is to capture carbon pollution directly at the source, for example from steel or cement plants. But another way, which this study focuses on, is “direct air capture.” This involves sucking carbon pollution directly out of the atmosphere and then storing it, often by injecting it into the ground. The problem with direct air capture is that while carbon dioxide may be a very potent planet-heating gas, its concentrations are very small – it makes up about 0.04% of air. This means removing it directly from the air is challenging and expensive. It’s a “significant hurdle,” Arup SenGupta, a professor at Lehigh University and a study author, told CNN. Even the biggest facilities can only remove relatively small amounts and it costs several hundred dollars to remove each ton of carbon. Climeworks’ direct air removal project in Iceland is the largest facility, according to the company, and can capture up to 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year. That’s equivalent to the carbon pollution produced by fewer than 800 cars over a year. The new technique laid out in the study can help tackle those problems, said SenGupta. The team have used copper to modify the absorbent material used in direct air capture. The result is an absorbent “which can remove CO2 from the atmosphere at ultra-dilute concentration at a capacity which is two to three times greater than existing absorbents,” SenGupta said. This material can be produced easily and cheaply and would help drive down the costs of direct air capture, he added. Once the carbon dioxide is captured, it can then be turned into sodium bicarbonate – baking soda – using seawater and released into the ocean at a small concentration. The oceans “are infinite sinks,” SenGupta said. “If you put all the CO2 from the atmosphere, emitted every day – or every year – into the ocean, the increase in concentration would be very, very minor,” he said. SenGupta’s idea is that direct air capture plants can be located offshore, giving them access to abundant amounts of seawater for the process. Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the chemistry was “novel and elegant.” The process is a modification of one we already know, he said, “which is easier to understand, scale-up and develop than something totally new.” But there may be regulatory hurdles to surmount. “Disposing of large tonnages of sodium bicarbonate in the ocean could be legally defined as ‘dumping,’ which is banned by international treaties,” Haszeldine said. Others remain concerned about negative impacts on the oceans, which are already under pressure from climate change, pollution and other human activity. Peter Styring, professor of chemical engineering and chemistry at the University of Sheffield, told CNN: “Unless you’ve got a full eco-toxic study, then you don’t know what it’s going to do, even at small concentrations.” Direct air capture also remains expensive and inefficient, Styring said. “This is a big scale problem. Why would you capture from the atmosphere when you’ve got so much coming out of power stations and industrial plants? It just makes sense to go for the high concentrations first,” he said. Some scientists have expressed concerns that a focus on technology to remove carbon pollution could distract from policies to reduce fossil fuel burning, or could give polluters license to carry on polluting. But given the scale of the climate crisis, there is a big push from governments and international bodies to scale up this technology. More research will be needed to understand how the method works at scale, Haszeldine said. But it’s promising, he added, saying “the world needs lots of this type of discovery.” SenGupta said the technology is ready to be taken out of the lab and trialed. “This is the time to go forward and do something in maybe two or three different places around the world. Let other people get involved, find faults, improve on it, and then proceed accordingly,” he said."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","From lengthy droughts to severe flooding, the intensity of water-related disasters around the world has increased over the last two decades as global temperatures climbed to record levels, according to new research. The study from NASA scientists published Monday in the journal Nature Water found that increasingly frequent, widespread and intense droughts and floods were linked more strongly to higher global temperatures than to naturally changing weather patterns, like El Niño and La Niña. This suggests these intense events will increase as the climate crisis accelerates, the study says. The study comes as California is slammed with its 11th atmospheric river so far this season – storms that have brought torrential rainfall and crushing snow to a region that for the past several years has been mired in extreme drought. These storms have caused significant flooding, mudslides, collapsed bridges and unusable roads. While scientists have been predicting climate change will increase the frequency of droughts and floods, it has been tricky to measure. Matthew Rodell, lead author of the study and hydrologist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, looked at 20 years of NASA satellite data from 2002 to 2021, and analyzed the size, duration, and severity – how much wetter or drier it is than normal – of water-related extreme events around the world. The study identified 505 extreme wet events and 551 extreme dry events during this period, with roughly 70% lasting six months or less and about 10% lasting for more than a year. The scientists found that these extreme events grew in intensity and frequency since 2015, when the trend of record warm years began. “We thought, well, maybe this is related to global warming, because we do know the past seven or so years have been the hottest on record,” Rodell told CNN. “Sure enough, there was a significant correlation between this total worldwide intensity of these events and the temperature record.” Rodell wanted to be certain of this conclusion, so he ran analyses to rule out other climate indicators including El Niño-Southern Oscillation, which is a natural climate pattern that involves sea temperature changes in the Pacific Ocean and affects weather globally. And in the end, he said the climate change signal was stronger than the other natural indicators. “What I feel more confident about is that as the world warms, we’re going to see the greater global intensity of all the wet and dry events increase, meaning they’re going to be more frequent, larger and more severe in total,” Rodell said. “What happens in a regional sense is a little bit more difficult to say with certainty.” Monday’s report found that the most extreme wet event during the study period happened in 2020 in sub-Saharan Africa, where months of intense rain swelled Lake Victoria – Africa’s largest lake – to the highest levels ever recorded. Rising water flooded homes and affected critical infrastructure such as drinking water, healthcare facilities, and hydropower. The most intense dry event the study recorded was in Brazil and Venezuela from 2015 to 2016, which Rodell said “was about twice as intense” as the current drought in the southwestern US as of the end of 2021. The drought severely threatened hydroelectric power, drained critical reservoirs, and cut crop yields. Richard Seager, professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, who was not involved with the study, told CNN that the scientists’ use of satellites to analyze water events was a new angle as most studies just measure levels of precipitation or soil moisture. “This study uses novel data to confirm that human-driven warming is driving the climate system to more extremes of extended both wet and dry episodes,” he said. UN scientists recently concluded that as the climate changes, droughts that may have occurred only once every 10 years or so now happen 70% more frequently; whereas heavy rainfall that used to happen once every 10 years now occurs 30% more often. While 2022 was not included in the study period, vast swaths of the world saw extreme events last year, including the deadly flooding that submerged a third of Pakistan as well as the severe European drought that caused some rivers to dip to historic lows. Kim Cobb, a climate scientist and director of the Institute for Environment and Society at Brown University who did not participate in the study, told CNN that the latest research brings “a new lens on our rapidly changing water cycle, linking many of the headlines about droughts, floods and wildfires to this global analysis.” Dramatic swings between both extremes – periods of drought and high precipitation – also known as weather whiplash is another phenomenon that scientists warn will occur more often under a warming planet in the coming decades. California, which has been experiencing a historic megadrought triggering severe water shortages, has been suddenly pummeled by heavy rain and snowstorms over the last few months. “This finding really reinforces the trends that we see from analysis of rainfall data and climate model output, and in that sense adds significant evidence to inform emergency planning and response, infrastructure planning, agricultural practices, and water resource management under continued warming,” Cobb said. Rodell added he hopes the study will help people realize that every little increase in global temperature matters, and that the world must curb the relentless rise of planet-warming pollution. “The study is another way for people to recognize that climate change affects everyone,” he said. “It’s not just about the temperature rising on average around the world, it’s the actual weather events that have severe impacts on people that may be increasing in intensity and frequency.”"

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Only 13 of the world’s countries and territories had “healthy” air quality last year, according to a new report, as air pollution surged to alarming levels in 2022. The report by IQAir, a company that tracks air quality worldwide, found that average annual air pollution in roughly 90% of the countries and territories analyzed exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which are designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health. IQAir analyzed average air quality from 131 countries and territories, and found that just six countries — Australia, Estonia, Finland, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — and seven territories in the Pacific and Caribbean, including Guam and Puerto Rico, met the WHO air quality guidelines, which call for an average air pollution level of 5 micrograms per cubic meter or less. Seven countries – Chad, Iraq, Pakistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Kuwait and India – had poor air quality that far exceeded the WHO guidelines with average air pollution over 50 micrograms per cubic meter. The study looked specifically at fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, which is the tiniest pollutant but also the most dangerous. When inhaled, the PM2.5 travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health problems including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. WHO tightened its annual air pollution guidelines in September 2021, cutting the acceptable amount of fine particulate matter from 10 to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. Millions of people die each year from air pollution-related health issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to the UN agency. If the latest guidelines had been applied back then, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. The report also continues to highlight a worrying inequality: the lack of monitoring stations in developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, which results in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. Although Africa saw improvement in the number of countries included in this year’s report compared with 2021, the continent still largely remains the most underrepresented. According to IQAir, only 19 out of 54 African countries had sufficient data available from their monitoring stations. Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, said that each time it adds a new country that once lacked air quality data – as it did with Chad in 2021 – those countries inevitably wind up at the top of the most-polluted list. “If you look at what’s called satellite or modeled data, Africa is supposed to be probably the most polluted continent on the planet, but we don’t have enough data,” Hammes told CNN. “What that means is there’s a whole lot more data that’s needed in order for us to truly determine what are the most polluted countries and cities in the world.” But one of the biggest barriers right now, she said, is “the way that governments currently monitor air quality.” Hammes said most governments tend to invest in instruments that fail to accurately measure fine particulate matter in the air. In the United States, the report found air pollution improved significantly last year compared with 2021 due to a relatively mild wildfire season. Coffeyville, Kansas, had the worst air quality in the US last year, which IQAir attributed to a nearby oil refinery. Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta and Chicago topped the list of major US cities with the worst air quality, though the researchers also noted that California was home to 10 of the 15 worst major cities for air pollution, including Los Angeles and Sacramento. Around the world, researchers said, the main sources of air pollution last year were wildfires and the burning of fossil fuels for transportation and energy production, which wreaks havoc on the most vulnerable and marginalized communities. “This is literally about how we as a planet are continuing this unhealthy relationship with fossil fuels,” Hammes said. “We are still dependent on fossil fuels and fossil fuels are responsible for the majority of air pollution that we encounter on this planet.” China, which had for decades been near the top of the list for the worst air pollution, continued to show improved air quality in 2022. Nearly 64% of the 524 cities analyzed in mainland China saw reductions in annual PM2.5. Still, IQAir notes that the country’s coal usage continues to be a major climate and environmental concern, and that despite the improvement, none of the Chinese cities actually met the annual WHO guidelines. Climate change-fueled wildfires, Hammes said, also play a significant role in worsening air quality, especially in the US. The report notes that wildfires in recent years have been rapidly erasing air quality improvements that the US has made over the past decade. “Wildfires are very much so a global warming issue, and it is creating essentially unsafe conditions,” Hammes said. Hammes said countries must learn from each other, noting that the countries with best air quality, for example, are the ones taking on specific actions to transition away from polluting industries and into greener forms of energy, such as solar and wind. She adds it is also important to expand air quality monitoring networks, especially in predominantly disadvantaged regions. For instance, despite Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, the IQAir report shows that Ukraine expanded air monitoring networks, collecting data from nearly triple the number of cities in 2022 than in 2021. “What we’ve learned is that what gets measured gets done,” Hammes said. “We need to collect more data. We need to inform folks of this information, and it does need to be free and available, so that they can make more informed choices.”"

But what has happened shocked him, he said. “The length – five months – and intensity of this endless, brutal heat went beyond what I had imagined,” Herrara said. Records have been beaten time and time again. Buenos Aires has seen highs above 30 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit) every day since February 28. Multiple other locations across the country saw their highest temperatures in the last 63 years during March. In key agricultural provinces of Córdoba, Santa Fe and Northern Buenos Aires, the heat has been “catastrophic” for corn and soybean crops, Mickaël Attia, crop analyst for EarthDaily Analytics, told CNN. “The worst drought of the last 30 years in Argentina will have an enormous impact on national corn and soybean production, which is expected to be at least 20-30% lower than last year,” he said. Wheat is also affected. Exports are projected to fall 28% in 2023 compared to last year, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Farmers are facing loses of around $14 billion, Julio Calzada, head of economic research at the Rosario Grains Exchange, told Reuters. There are fears that the agricultural crisis will exacerbate the country’s economic problems. Figures released this week showed yearly inflation topped 100% for the first time in three decades – one of the highest inflation rates in the world. The heat-stricken country is also grappling with wildfires. More than 100,000 hectares (nearly 250,000 acres) have been burned this year in northeast Argentina, according to an AFP report. While Argentina’s brutal heatwave has been driven by La Niña, which has just ended after three consecutive years, some scientists have pointed to the role the climate crisis plays in intensifying these events. A February report from the World Weather Attribution initiative found that while climate change was not the main driver of low rainfall in central South America, it was causing higher temperatures in the region, likely reducing water availability and making the drought more severe. Another WWA report in December found that record temperatures in Argentina and other South American countries late last year were made 60 times more likely by human-caused climate change. Herrera cautioned against blaming individual extreme weather events on the climate crisis, but, he said, “generally speaking it’s true that climate change, by fueling more energy to the atmosphere and the oceans, might be responsible for bigger contrasts which in turn worsen such extreme events.” As global temperatures continue to rise, scientists say heatwaves will only become more common. CNN’s Claudia Rebaza and Stefano Pozzebon contributed to this story"

","Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN","Brightly colored toys buried in mud. Brown murky water where cars once parked. Family photos floating through a neighborhood. This is what one Southern California community looked like last week, lifelong Ventura resident Angie Thompson said, after the state’s 11th atmospheric river this winter wrought hurricane-like winds and catastrophic flooding. “We’re tired,” Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said of a similar mess and clean-up effort hundreds of miles to the north as she joined Gov. Gavin Newsom and other local leaders to tour damage, including the breached Pajaro River levee. “Everyone is tired.” Yet again, though, the vast state is bracing for the wet blast of another atmospheric river – a long, narrow moisture band that carries saturated air thousands of miles, then discharges it like a fire hose. It’s due to impact the US West from Monday to Wednesday, with widespread rain across central and Southern California and more snow in the Sierra Nevada. While the series of storm systems – a regular part of California weather that may be supercharged this year by key climate patterns – is putting a dent in the state’s historic drought, it’s also lashed many of its residents to a carousel of misery with at least one more ride in store. “We have neighbors that have lost their entire home,” Thompson said. “One person in particular lost everything, and every time they’d get it under control, something else would happen, and the water would reroute and come back right through the family’s home.” The fatigue reaches far beyond those forced to muck out their living rooms. Evacuees fret over when they might be able to return. First responders ponder more triple-shift days – sometimes with their own relatives in need of rescue. And for some who’ve survived California’s other recent woes – from wildfires to mudslides to the Covid-19 pandemic – it’s another battle in the war with worry. “Anxiety wants something that no one can have, which is 100% certainty about things,” said Andrea Kulberg, a  licensed clinical psychologist who works with Southern California clients highly anxious about disaster. People, she said, “want answers that no one can give them.” Thompson’s driveway has been a lake since an atmospheric river in January pushed a creek into the Camp Chaffee neighborhood where she’s lived for four years, she told CNN. Flooding swept away a whole box of wedding albums, baby photos, clothing, appliances and tools likely passed down through generations. Compared to some neighbors, Thompson’s damage was minimal, she said. But no one remains untouched. “Cars, yards … It’s affected every single person over here,” she said. “It’s just really horrible to watch people’s lives just wash down the river.” A four-hours’ drive north, more than 2,000 people were evacuated – and more then 200 rescued – this month in Pajaro. Ruth Ruiz left in hurry before dawn March 11 and couldn’t immediately return, she told CNN affiliate KPIX. She worried about her property – and how long it might take to get back to normal life. “We don’t really have a plan. We’re just taking it day by day,” Ruiz said. “But we have a feeling it’s going to be months before even insurance can cover any damages.” Von Berlanga, meanwhile, stayed in Pajaro and watched last week as water started seeping into his garage, he told CNN. His mom’s home had flooded back in January 1995, when an intense winter storm slammed Monterey County with 6 inches of rain, damaging over 100 homes. Three months later, a second winter storm hit already-saturated areas, causing much more damage. As the latest of this year’s atmospheric rivers pushed toward shore, Berlanga stayed put with supplies, even as the furnace still showed markings from the 1995 flood, he told CNN. “I was prepared,” he said. “I had 30 gallons of water, food for me, food for my dogs.” Then as floodwater started seeping into his garage, Berlanga raised his vintage cars out of harm’s way. “I jacked up my cars real quick. … They’re OK,” he said as he used a wide hoe to push muddy water around the driveway. “I woke up about 4 o’clock this morning and started cleaning.” During January’s storms, Ventura County Fire Department Capt. Brian McGrath and his team also rushed into action – completing about 80 rescues in one day, he told CNN. Such calls weren’t nearly as frequent last week, he said, crediting residents with being more prepared. As another atmospheric river revs up, McGrath and his team are, as always, on call, ready to go within 45 seconds – in some cases for 48 hours or more straight – he said. But being a firefighter in one’s own community can be draining. “We try to treat everyone around the community as members of our families or friends because a lot of times they are,” McGrath said. “We will make a rescue or end up finding out that it was one of our coworkers friends or family members.” “That also runs a toll on us because we’re missing so much of our own family.” McGrath is grateful for support from his colleagues and relatives, he told CNN. Without it, going from a long fire season straight into a long winter storm season would be completely draining. The state’s varied existential risks – on top of the waning pandemic – also weighs on ordinary Californians. As clinical director of Anxiety Experts in Southern California, Kulberg treats clients with anxiety stemming from the state’s deadly wildfires, mudslides and now its devastating floods, she told CNN. Some lost their homes or were rescued from their roofs. People “want to know: How long am I going to be distressed for? When’s it going to end? How bad is it gonna get?” she said. “No human can have that.” Through a treatment known as exposure therapy, Kulberg works with clients to confront their own stories repeatedly “to habituate to their fear thoughts and memories and visualizations surrounding the story.” “Then, they no longer are fearful of having their thoughts and memories and body sensations of anxiety surrounding those events,” she said. For those dealing with higher levels of anxiety during these times, Kulberg offers these recommendations: • Remember anxiety cannot harm you; it comes in spikes and it will eventually subside. • Remember thoughts are not threats; thoughts that something terrible might happen as a result of extreme weather don’t mean it is more likely to happen, and most of what we think never comes true. • Regardless of what body sensations or thoughts of anxiety might be present, try to continue to do things that bring meaning and purpose to life. CNN meteorologist Gene Norman and CNN’s Natasha Chen, Veronica Miracle and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report."

Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety. The world is rapidly approaching catastrophic levels of heating with international climate goals set to slip out of reach unless immediate and radical action is taken, according to a new UN-backed report. “The climate time-bomb is ticking,” said António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, in a statement to mark the launch of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s synthesis report on Monday. “Humanity is on thin ice – and that ice is melting fast,” he added. The report draws on the findings of hundreds of scientists to provide a comprehensive assessment of how the climate crisis is unfolding. The science is not new – the report pulls together what the IPCC has already set out in a cluster of other reports over the last few years – but it paints a very stark picture of where the world is heading. “This report is the most dire and troubling assessment yet of the spiraling climate impacts we all face if systemic changes are not made now,” Sara Shaw, program coordinator at Friends of the Earth International, said in a statement. The impacts of planet-warming pollution are already more severe than expected and we are hurtling towards increasingly dangerous and irreversible consequences, the report says. While the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels is still possible, the report noted, the pathway to achieving it is rapidly closing as global production of planet-heating pollution continues to increase – emissions grew by nearly 1% last year. Concentrations of carbon pollution in the atmosphere are at their highest level for more than two million years and the rate of temperature rise over the last half a century is the highest in 2,000 years. The impacts of the climate crisis continue to fall hardest on poorer, vulnerable countries that have done least to cause it. “Our planet is already reeling from severe climate impacts, from scorching heat waves and destructive storms to severe droughts and water shortages,” said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of World Resources Institute, in a statement. The biggest threat to climate change action is the world’s continued addiction to burning fossil fuels, which still make up more than 80% of the world’s energy and 75% of human-caused planet-heating pollution. Despite the International Energy Agency saying in 2021 that there can now be no new fossil fuel developments if the world is to meet climate commitments, governments are continuing to approve oil, gas and coal projects. The Biden administration has just greenlit the hugely controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska. Once operational, it is projected to produce enough oil to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon pollution a year – equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads. Arati Prabhakar, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a statement that the new UN  report shows “the Earth’s future is not predetermined.” “It underscores the urgent need for leaders in every sector and every country to step up and take bold climate action,” Prabhakar said. China is planning a huge expansion of coal – the dirtiest of fossil fuels. In 2022, it granted permits for coal production across 82 sites, equal to starting two large coal power plants each week, according to a report last month. But Monday’s report also set out pathways to keep the world on track to limit warming to within 1.5 degrees. “This IPCC report is both a blistering condemnation of major emitters’ inaction and a sound blueprint for a much safer and more equitable world,” Dasgupta said. Staving off the worst impacts of the climate crisis will require radical shifts across every sector of the economy and society, according to the report. It called for deep cuts to planet-heating pollution by moving away from fossil fuels and investing in renewable energy. To limit warming to 1.5 degrees, global levels of planet-heating pollution must fall by 60% by 2035 compared with 2019, according to the report. It emphasized the need for greater investment to build resilience to climate impacts, and increased support for people struggling with climate-related losses, especially in the most vulnerable countries. The report also said we need to remove carbon from the air, including potentially through technology such as “direct air capture” – removing carbon directly from the air and storing it, possibly by injecting it underground. This technology does remain divisive, however, as some believe it distracts from policies to cut planet-heating pollution. “In my country, Sri Lanka, the impacts of climate change are being felt now. We have no time to chase fairy tales like carbon removal technologies to suck carbon out of the air,” Hemantha Withanage, chair of Friends of the Earth International, said in a statement. Guterres called on all countries to “massively fast-track climate efforts” and, specifically, for rich countries to hit “the fast-forward button” on commitments to reach net-zero – which means removing as much plant-heating pollution from the atmosphere as they emit. For the first time, he said developed countries must reach net-zero as close to 2040 as possible, far earlier than the 2050 deadline a lot of countries – including the US and the UK – have pledged to meet. “Today’s IPCC report is a how-to guide to defuse the climate time-bomb,” Guterres said. “But it will take a quantum leap in climate action,” he added. The report, which was signed off over the weekend by representatives from the UN’s nearly 200 countries, will feed into the next UN climate conference, COP28, in Dubai at the end of the year. The conference will include the first “global stocktake” from the Paris Climate Agreement, an assessment of progress toward addressing the climate crisis and averting climate catastrophe."

","Sana Noor Haq, CNN","The world is facing a looming global water crisis that threatens to “spiral out of control” as increased demand for water and the intensifying impacts of the climate crisis put huge pressure on water resources, a UN report has warned. Water use has increased by about 1% a year over the last 40 years, driven by population growth and changing consumption patters, according to the UN World Water Development Report published Tuesday, on the eve of a major UN water summit in New York. By 2050, the number of people in cities facing water scarcity is projected to nearly double from 930 million people in 2016 to up to 2.4 billion, the report found. Urban water demand is expected to increase by 80% by 2050. Without action to address the problem of water scarcity, “there definitely will be a global crisis,” said Richard Connor, the report’s lead author, at a news conference to launch the report. Water access is already a huge problem. Two billion people do not currently have safe drinking water and 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation, according to the report. About 10% of the global population already lives in countries with high or critical water stress. Urban and industrial growth and agriculture are compounding existing shortages, with agriculture alone using up 70% of the world’s water supply, Connor said. Seasonal water scarcity is set to increase in areas where water is currently plentiful including in Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America, the report found. Meanwhile, scarcity will worsen in the Middle East and the Sahel region in Africa, where water is already in short supply. Extreme and prolonged droughts, made more frequent and severe by the climate crisis, are also putting pressure on ecosystems, which could have “dire consequences” for plant and animal species, the report’s authors said. Solutions include better international cooperation to avoid conflicts over water, Connor said. Flood and pollution control, data sharing and efforts to reduce levels of planet-heating pollution should “open the door to further collaboration and increase access to water funds,” he said. “There is an urgent need to establish strong international mechanisms to prevent the global water crisis from spiraling out of control,” said Audrey Azoulay, the director general of UNESCO, the UN’s cultural body. “Water is our common future, and it is essential to act together to share it equitably and manage it sustainably.”"

","Rachel Ramirez and Brandon Miller, CNN","California has faced an onslaught of powerful, atmospheric river storms this winter, which has led to record-breaking snowpack, nearly full reservoirs and overflowing watersheds. At this time last year, all of California was caught in a drought. But according to the latest US Drought Monitor released Thursday morning, just over a third of California remains in some level of drought – the lowest amount since the drought began – with severe drought only covering 8% of the state. For the last three years, the state has been in desperate need of some rain and snow. Just a month ago, more than 33 million people in California, including in the major metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego, were facing an unrelenting drought. Years of unfavorable precipitation trends and more intense heat waves have fed directly to the state’s prolonged, historic megadrought that has triggered dire water shortages. Now, that number has dropped dramatically, with 4.6 million people still facing drought conditions. Snowpack, which serves as a natural reservoir that eases the drought, has largely reached an all-time record high. The state’s largest reservoirs, which were recently at critically low levels, have been replenished and are way past its historical averages. Groundwater reserves, however, are still having a hard time recovering, even with all the rain. “The good news is that the wet winter has eased the drought significantly,” Jon Gottschalck, of the Climate Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said at a media briefing last week. “Drought is expected to improve further or go away completely across much of California.” Here is where things stand in California after this epic winter. Climate researchers have said it’s the lack of precipitation, higher temperatures and an increase in evaporative demand – also known as the “thirst of the atmosphere” – that had pushed the West’s drought into historic territory. So these storms, experts say, were desperately needed. After at least 12 significant atmospheric river storms pummeled California since December, rainfall totals amounted to 150% to 200% of normal since October across most major cities. Since October 1, the start of the water year, Los Angeles has received more than 24 inches of rain, which is nearly 200% of normal for the time period. In addition, San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento, Stockton and Fresno have also all seen 150% to 200% of their normal rainfall since then. High-elevation snowpack in the Sierra Nevada accounts for 30% of California’s fresh water supply in an average year, according to the California Department of Water Resources. After years of being at record lows, the state is seeing more than double what they normally see on April 1, when the state surveys the snowpack to forecast the year’s water resources. The Southern Sierra now stands at 283% of normal and has never been higher since official record-keeping began in the 1950s. The Central Sierra is at 231% of normal, which is almost at record high, and may reach that point soon after this most recent atmospheric river storm. Meanwhile, the Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab near Tahoe reported Monday that it has received 677 inches of snow this winter, which is second only to the winter of 1952, when 812 inches fell. The barrage of storms has also increased soil moisture, which is good for California’s severely parched vegetation. Moisture in plants help keep California wildfires at bay, and April 1 is usually the time of the year when the state has the highest fuel moisture content. Brad Rippey, meteorologist with the US Department of Agriculture, said the acres of land that have been fallowed due to the drought should decrease in California for the 2023 growing season due to improved water allocations. Land for rice production in the Central Valley, for example, decreased from 517,000 acres in 2020 to 256,000 acres last year, according to the USDA. But “those gains may be partially offset in areas where levee breaches caused extensive flooding,” Rippey said. “Severely flooded agricultural land, including areas along the Salinas and Pajaro Rivers, may not be planted in 2023 due to soil contamination, pathogenic testing or simply missing the appropriate window for planting.” This winter’s precipitation will undoubtedly help the state’s reservoirs in the short-term, which have for several years been running at critically low levels. This record snowpack is good for reservoir storage since the snowpack stores water through the winter months and slowly releases it through the spring and summer melting season. The months of deluge have already helped raise the levels in the state’s largest reservoirs, Shasta Lake and Lake Oroville, bringing them back to historical averages. The reservoirs have risen by more than 100 to 180 feet respectively since December. Rippey said end-of-February storage in the state’s 154 primary intrastate reservoirs is effectively normal for the end of winter, “But storage does not yet include the amazing snowpack that will melt in coming months.” According to the California Department of Water Resources, these reservoirs gained almost 10 million acre-feet of water from November 30, 2022, to February 28, 2023 – an improvement from 67% to 96% of normal and from 35% to 61% of capacity. And additional storage gains have occurred during March, especially after recent storms. (An acre-foot is the amount of water that would fill one acre a foot deep – roughly 326,000 gallons.) “We’re up approximately 7.5 million acre feet in California storage since last year at this time, so already a significant gain in water supply and this snowpack is going to benefit those reservoirs, as opposed to melt in the spring,” said Brett Whitin, a hydrologist with the California Nevada River Forecast Center. “But it will be a challenge to manage all this snowpack. I mean, there’s been record snow and a lot of these rivers have limited channel capacity downstream, so getting that water out safely is going to be a challenge.” But overall, Andrew Schwartz, lead scientist at the Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab, previously told CNN that he is “cautiously optimistic” that all this snow will go far to alleviate the state’s reservoir concerns this year. While the rain has largely benefited California, the situation in the drought-stricken Colorado River Basin remains dire: The country’s largest reservoirs – Lake Powell and Lake Mead – are hovering at or near record-low levels following several years of drought and continued overuse. But it could also improve in the coming months as snowpack levels rise in the region. “It’s definitely moving in the right direction, but we’re far from filling the reservoirs in the Colorado River system and we’re far from being at a comfortable point from a water supply perspective,” Paul Miller, a hydrologist at the Colorado River Basin Forecast Center, told journalists last week. As the cocktail of rain and snow raise snowpack and reservoir levels, experts remain concerned about the state’s groundwater aquifers, which is another major source of water for residents, agriculture and industry, particularly in the Central Valley. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California in Los Angeles, previously told CNN that even with a huge winter like this, it won’t ultimately solve the groundwater problem. That’s partly because they expect drought conditions to return as the West’s climate changes, but also because there’s just too much demand on the system. “This is not nearly enough, partly because it’s a supply and demand problem. We still got a lot of straws in the ground,” Swain said. “But you’d need multiple years like this in a row to really move the needle on recharging those aquifers.” There are nearly 200 groundwater monitoring sites in California, according to data from the US Geological Survey, all of which show a variety of conditions from complete recovery to partial recovery of groundwater reserves. “Complications in some areas include decades of over-pumping of groundwater, leading to land subsidence and decreased groundwater storage capability – you can see a couple of low well readings in the San Joaquin Valley,” Rippey told CNN. “More realistically, there is a bit of lingering ‘groundwater drought’ in northeastern and southeastern California.” Experts have also been thinking about how California could harness all of the rainfall to help replenish groundwater. And they say the best thing to do would be to let the land flood in a controlled way, so it has a chance to absorb into the aquifers, instead of being channeled through levees, rivers and reservoirs and ultimately lost. “We have to let our rivers flow differently, and let the rivers flood a little more and recharge our groundwater in wet seasons,” Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and co-founder of the Pacific Institute in Oakland, previously told CNN. “Instead of thinking we can control all floods, we have to learn to live with them.” Gottschalck, of the Climate Prediction Center, said the Western spigot of rain and snow will likely turn off come April. “Our model forecast information that we have and the other climate indicators that we’re looking at, it does look like that will probably shut off as we go into our early part of April,” Gottschalck said. “And at that point, normal climatological precipitation, for much of California, goes toward zero quite quickly, so we do think there will be a break.” Water officials in California say that while the record-high snowpack and nearly full reservoirs are good news for the state, snow measurements on April 1 are considered the most important when it comes to forecasting the year’s water resources as well as the state of the drought."

In February, the European Parliament approved the law. All that was needed was a rubber stamp from the bloc’s political leaders. Then Germany changed its mind. In a reversal that stunned many EU insiders, the German government decided to push for a loophole that would allow the sale of combustion engine cars beyond the 2035 deadline — as long as they run on synthetic fuels. It’s an exception that could put the European Union’s green credentials at risk. The bloc is legally obligated to become carbon-neutral by 2050. With cars and vans responsible for around 15% of its total greenhouse gas emissions, a phase-out of polluting vehicles is a key part of EU climate policy. Here’s what’s at stake. The ban on internal combustion engine cars is intended to be one of the centerpieces of the European Union’s ambitious plan to cut its emissions to net zero by 2050 — which means removing from the air at least as much planet-heating pollution as the bloc emits. The law envisions a total ban on the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars by 2035. The European Union argues that the deadline is necessary because the average car’s lifespan is around 15 years — so to get a fleet that produces no carbon pollution by 2050, sales of combustion engine cars must end by 2035. But earlier this month, just before the final vote, Germany pushed back on the idea that all internal combustion engines must be banned. Instead, it argued for engines powered by “green” fuels to be allowed. Other European countries, including Italy, Poland and the Czech Republic, joined Germany in demanding the exception and after intense negotiations, the EU’s Climate Chief Frans Timmermans announced on Saturday that “an agreement with Germany on the future use of e-fuels in cars” had been reached. While the text of the law remains unchanged, Germany says it now has the assurances it was seeking from the EU on e-fuels. “Vehicles with combustion engines can still be newly registered after 2035 if they use only CO2-neutral fuels,” German transport minister Volker Wissing said on Twitter. Timmermans said the EU will work now on drafting specific rules to implement the agreement. Synthetic fuels, or e-fuels, are made using hydrogen and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere. Their proponents often portray them as “clean”, but the reality is not straightforward. Burning these man-made fuels releases similar amounts of planet-heating emissions and air pollutants as using conventional fossil fuels. The “green” credentials refer to the manufacturing process: e-fuels are made from carbon that was removed from the atmosphere, which offsets the emissions they produce. For climate campaigners and the lawmakers who negotiated the new rules, this is not good enough. “E-fuels emit carbon dioxide from the tailpipe,” said Dutch EU lawmaker Jan Huitema, who led in drafting the policy. There are other problems too. For one, e-fuels are not yet produced at scale. The manufacturing process is expensive and requires a lot of renewable energy. Supply of e-fuels is likely to be limited for some time, and critics say they should be reserved for industries that do not have a viable alternative to fossil fuels, such as aviation and shipping. Many EU policy makers were flabbergasted by the demands from Germany and others. The legislation had been in the works for more than two years and had required many rounds of negotiations. “I was the lead negotiator with the [European] Council on the final text, it was adopted there by the ambassadors of the different member states,” said Huitema. “You have an agreement and now, all of a sudden, a couple of member states want to refrain from the agreement. That is not how you negotiate and how you make deals with each other.” Climate groups say the changes water down action on climate change. Transport & Environment, a clean transport campaign group, said the loophole for e-fuels would slow down the transition to electric vehicles. “[Germany’s] plan would derail the decarbonization of the new fleet while allowing more conventional oil to be used in the existing fleet post-2035 — a win-win for Big Oil.” Even some carmakers came out against the potential changes to the law. A group of dozens of companies including Volvo and Ford penned an open letter to the European Union, pushing against the exception. “First-mover companies have already significantly invested in zero-emission vehicles and should be rewarded for taking the inherent risks to decarbonize their fleet. It would be a very negative signal to reverse the political agreement reached last year,” they said. Germany is governed by a coalition, and it is one of the parties, the liberal FDP, that called for the changes. “The internal combustion engine is not the problem. The fossil fuels that run it are,” Wissing, who is a member of the FDP, said on Twitter earlier this month. “The goal is climate neutrality, which is also an opportunity for new technologies. We need to be open to different solutions,” he added. Germany is home to some of the world’s largest automakers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Volkswagen, and the government has to walk a tightrope between ambitious climate policies and the interests of a powerful industry that keeps the economy humming. Manufacturers of car components and engines, fossil fuel producers and fuel transportation companies have lobbied for the exception because it would allow them to continue using their existing infrastructure and products. The Federation of German Industries, a lobby group, said e-fuels could make “a major contribution to achieving the adopted climate targets.” “Since they can be used immediately without having to build a new infrastructure, they can also be implemented in economically less developed countries,” according to a statement on the group’s website. The dispute over the legislation has caused friction within Germany’s government. Environment Minister Steffi Lemke of the Greens, another coalition party, criticized the challenge to the law. “Germany should remain a reliable partner to its EU partners. The new CO2 fleet regulation for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, which Germany has supported in recent months, is a major step forward for European climate protection,” she said in a statement earlier in March. The law is intended to be one of the world’s strongest measures to phase out gasoline vehicles. Scientists say reducing planet-heating pollution is non-negotiable if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels and avoid a key tipping point beyond which extreme flooding, droughts and wildfires will likely become much more frequent. Despite such warnings and the pledges made in the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change, global emissions have continued to rise, barring a dip in 2020. Some are concerned that the dispute casts doubt on the European Union’s ability to implement its ambitious climate agenda. “This debate is really destabilizing,” said Elisa Giannelli, a senior policy advisor at E3G, a climate think-tank, noting that the European Union had been “on track for climate neutrality.” “Backtracking on a piece of legislation is potentially really undermining the credibility of what we’ve achieved over the past years,” she said. “It’s not just about cars. It’s about the political signals that that [dispute] sends.” The revised law, which will allow some combustion engines that run on e-fuels to be sold beyond 2035, is expected to be approved on Tuesday. This story has been updated with new information"

","Bill Weir, CNN","One hundred years ago, colorful canaries warned humans of the hidden hazards of digging for coal by riding shotgun down the mine and dropping dead. Now, penguin experts say these birds that move like tuxedoed toddlers are showing us the hidden hazards of burning coal and other fossil fuels by the way they march. And as global warming changes the survival-of-the-fittest game at the bottom of the world, one particular species of Antarctic penguin is modeling a poignant lesson for humanity: Adapt or die…and make it quick. With numbers in the millions, Antarctica’s six species of waddling aquabats are far from extinction and as I stepped foot on the Antarctic peninsula in early March, and drank in the wildest place I’ve ever seen, there were hundreds there to make an adorable first impression. Colonies were brimming with life. But then I learned how the Southern Ocean warmed by the climate crisis is turning my little boy’s favorite bird into a sentinel species of the Anthropocene. While some are abandoning nesting sites where chicks have been hatching for thousands of years to find better ground, colonies of those that refuse to move have collapsed. “It is incredible,” Heather Lynch, the Endowed Chair for Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University told CNN. “As ecologists, we know that animals shift their range over geologic times, they disappear in one area and colonize new areas. But it’s rare to see those dynamics happening over the course of one’s career.” Along with seals, seabirds and baleen whales, penguins gorge mainly on Antarctic krill, a shrimp-like crustacean that thrives on the kind of phytoplankton found under sea ice. Unlike the Arctic, where sea ice has declined consistently, Antarctic sea ice has swung up and down – although recently scientists have seen a steep downwards trend. At the end of the Southern Hemisphere winter in September 2014, there were more than 7.7 million square miles of frozen saltwater floating around Antarctica – a record high – and many species like humpback whales were feasting on krill and thriving. But early this year, sea ice reached a record-shattering low of less than 700,000 square miles, breaking the previous record set just last year. “If we have a 1 degree [Celsius] temperature change in a temperate environment such as the UK or the US, who cares?” Tom Hart, biology lecturer at Oxford Brookes University explained. “Doesn’t ruin your day. But down there, 1 degree makes a huge difference – whether you can stand on water or sink into it. Or whether there’s snow cover on a breeding site or not. It’s a completely different habitat.” Using satellites, camera traps, citizen science and AI computing to keep tabs on millions of penguins around Antarctica, Hart and Lynch say they are watching a real-time lesson in evolution and adaptation. While Adélie and chinstrap penguins remain stuck in their ancient ways come hell or warm water, the much more flexible gentoo penguins are ranging further and further south. And as they show willingness to chase new prey or abandon a nest to increase the odds of long-term survival, their numbers are exploding. “Gentoo penguins are big climate change winners in the Antarctic,” Lynch said, confirming reports that some colonies in some parts have grown by 30,000%. “They are perfectly happy to take advantage of a warming Antarctic. They don’t mind that it’s getting wetter. The flip side of that is that the Adélie and chinstrap populations have cratered in many areas and particularly chinstrap penguins. Their populations have declined in some areas by as much as 80%.” “Adaptation means several things,” Hart said. “It means being really tough in a hard environment but it also means reading the room on seasonality. It means averaging, so if you don’t do well one year, you’ve got to do better. And then you really only have to do well one year in three.” “I think there’s a lesson in here for us as well,” Lynch said. “If we just stick to what we’ve always done, it’s not going to turn out well for us. Just because Manhattan has always been where it is, does it make sense that it will be there in 200 or 300 years? I don’t know. But I think we would benefit from being plastic and flexible and adaptive. And I think that’s kind of what the gentoos are telling us.” Along with the worry that a crash in krill could follow the crash in ice, avian flu is now present in Chile and Argentina and Hart predicts it could migrate with seabirds to the Antarctic Peninsula next spring and devastate penguin colonies. “I think we’re in for a horrible year next year,” he told me. “But we won’t know until it happens.” These cascading threats also make gentoos an example of what humans in the world of terrifying UN climate reports call the “hard” and “soft” limits of adaptation. If political or financial hurdles block an available strategy, it’s considered a soft limit. But if the physical changes are too sudden and severe, there is a hard limit to finding any fix at all. As I saw during the expedition in early March, even the roll-with-the-punches gentoos are struggling after a warmer, wetter Antarctic created snow and rain events freakish enough to delay this year’s penguin nesting season by a month. We watched with grim resignation as gentoo couples gathered rocks for worthless nests and mothers hatched chicks that simply won’t have enough time to grow the feathers and fat needed to survive winter. But Lynch reminded me that was one colony on one island, and so far, what doesn’t kill a gentoo only makes it tougher. If they changed neighborhoods so easily, she believes, they’ll just shift the timing of their baby-making season. “I think that if there was a permanent shift towards a snowy year climate, gentoo penguins would probably start breeding earlier,” she said. “I think the gentoos are going to be just fine.”"

Here’s how they’re doing it",03-29-2023,"                                                 Cities’ relationship with water is a fragile balance. Too little leads to parched landscapes and water shortages; too much can cause deadly flooding, washing away homes, lives and livelihoods.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","Cities’ relationship with water is a fragile balance. Too little leads to parched landscapes and water shortages; too much can cause deadly flooding, washing away homes, lives and livelihoods. Last year severe flooding caused devastation around the world, including in Nigeria, Pakistan and Australia. And it’s predicted to get worse. Parts of Asia’s largest cities are projected to be underwater by the end of the century. US coasts are expected to see 10 to 12 inches of sea level rise by 2050. To protect themselves, cities have tended to focus on trying to keep water out, often turning to concrete: Building up walls, dams and other “gray infrastructure.” “This approach works well when it is possible to predict the extent and volumes of flooding events, but has serious limitations in the current climate unpredictability,” Elisa Palazzo, senior lecturer at UNSW Sydney’s School of Built Environment, told CNN. As the climate crisis continues to threaten cities and reshape coastlines, it’s prompted some to try a different way. These vulnerable urban areas are looking to work with, rather than against, water by incorporating it into the fabric of the city – soaking it utp when there’s too much; retaining it when there’s too little. Whether these efforts can scale up quickly enough to meet the enormity of the climate challenge cities face is not yet clear. But they show the possibilities when cities stop seeing water only as a threat to be controlled by concrete. Here’s how five cities are trying to reclaim their relationship with water. Bangkok – constructed on the floodplains of the Chao Phraya River – is incredibly vulnerable to flooding. In 2011, devastating floods inundated the city, killing hundreds of people. To add to the pressure, as the water levels in the Gulf of Thailand rise, the city of nearly 11 million people, which sits at about 1.5 meters above sea level, is sinking due to growing urbanization. Thai architect Kotchakorn Voraakhom, who founded the landscape architecture firm Landprocess, has dedicated much of her work to understanding how to design better for floods by asking: “What if we could design cities to work with nature instead of against it?” “Climate change is causing cities to sink, and our current infrastructure makes us even more vulnerable to severe flooding,” she told CNN. One of her solutions for Bangkok is Centenary Park at Chulalongkorn University in central Bangkok – a rare green space in a city with a dearth of them. Completed in 2017, the 11-acre park (45,000 square meters) is designed to work with and capture water. Built on a slope, it is able to funnel water through its gardens and artificial wetlands, then into a retention pond. Perhaps its most ingenious feature lies out of sight. Underneath the park are underground tanks able to hold 160,000 gallons of water. Altogether the park can hold up to one million gallons of water. The concept for the park came from the idea of monkey cheeks, Voraakhom told the New York Times. Monkeys use their cheeks to store food to eat when he’s hungry; that’s what the park aims to do with water. Green spaces can also help reduce air pollution and reduce the urban heat island effect, where dense, concrete-heavy cities trap heat. While Centenary Park is only a tiny slice of the city, Voraakhom said it’s an example of what can be done. China, which suffers from both flooding and drought, has long been an advocate of “sponge cities.” The idea is to enable cities to soak up and retain excess water with designs focused on nature, including gardens, green roofs, wetlands and permeable sidewalks – allowing water to both sink into the ground and flow outwards. In 2015, the government announced a pilot scheme of 16 sponge cities, prompted in part by severe flooding which hit Beijing in 2012, killing nearly 80 people and causing widespread damage. Many more projects have since been added. “All cities are trying to resist water like an enemy,” said architect and professor Kongjian Yu, founder of design firm Turenscape and the pioneer of sponge cities. The aim of sponge cities is to “give water more space,” he told CNN. Yongxing River Park in Beijing is one of Yu’s many sponge city projects. Formerly a concrete drainage channel, Turenscape turned it into a “sponge river,” designed to manage floodwaters and filter rainwater. A network of paths connects the park, which is full of plants and trees, including willow, crab apple and hawthorn trees. It also has playgrounds for children as well as a sports ground. As sponge cities proliferate in China, there have been some questions about their ability to cope with heavier rains and storms, made more severe by climate change. In 2021, the city of Zhengzhou, in Henan province, which is part of the sponge city initiative, experienced devastating rains that killed almost 300 people. But for Yu, sponge cities offer a necessary correction to the mistakes that have been made as cities grow, including damaging and destroying rivers and wetlands and heavy reliance on concrete. The Netherlands, around a third of which lies below sea level, is trying to work with the water by literally building on it. Rotterdam is home to the world’s first floating dairy, which opened in 2019, as well as floating parks made from waste and even a floating office building. And over the last few years, the idea of floating homes has been slowly gaining traction. In the northern Amsterdam neighborhood of Schoonschip, architecture firm Space&Matter has designed a community of 30 houses on the water. Construction was completed in 2021 and it’s now home to more than 100 residents. “The thinking behind floating homes comes like logic when living in a city like Amsterdam. Water and land are interwoven,” said Jeroen Dellensen, one of the three founders, along with Jaspar Jansen and Chris Collaris, of design firm i29, which designed one of the houses in the community. Built with timber frames and insulated with burlap and straw, the homes are equipped with heat pumps and solar panels. Roof gardens aim to help them cool in the summer as well as absorbing rainwater. A flexible jetty connects the houses with each other and to the land. They are designed to rise and fall with the ebb and flow of the water. “Schoonschip seeks to serve as a prototype for how to deal with coastal and delta regions under pressure. Instead of fighting rising sea levels, we should adapt to and embrace the water as an urban condition,” Tjeerd Haccou, co-founder of Space&Matter, told CNN. The community is designed to withstand changing water levels over the next few decades, but it will need extra infrastructural support to resist the much higher sea levels projected beyond that, Haccou said. Few countries are more at risk from the climate crisis than the Maldives. The vast majority of the archipelago of more than 1,000 islands in the Indian Ocean sits less than one meter above sea level. The threat of flooding, combined with a need for more housing, is driving a project from the government – in partnership with developer Dutch Docklands – to build a new floating city. It’s a kind of “techno city … [but] with the look and feel of an old fisherman village from the Maldives,” Koen Olthuis, a founder of Waterstudio, the firm designing the city, told CNN. Located on a lagoon about 10 minutes by boat from the capital Male, the city will be made of a series of floating units which are built locally and towed out into the water. They will be attached to the seabed on telescopic stilts which will allow the city to rise and fall with the waves and cope with rising sea levels. Olthuis said the environmental impact was rigorously assessed. The design is based on a brain coral and its ability to find “a balance between space and openness,” he explained, adding that the city would look like such a coral from above. The aim is a dense city that provides enough space for people while ensuring enough sunlight reaches the seafloor beneath it. Artificial coral banks will be attached underneath the city to create coral ecosystems. Construction starts in earnest toward the end of this year and is expected to be completed by the start of 2028. Floating cities have been criticized for offering housing solutions that will be too expensive, but Olthuis said affordability was a requirement set by the government in the Maldives. The aim is for 90% of residents to be local to the Maldives and the houses will be at the same price level as similar properties in Male, he said. “There is a growing need for these kinds of developments,” said Olthuis, who said his firm has had many requests about floating cities: “Not because people love the idea of living on water, but because it can be a solution for the need for space and safety caused by the effects of climate change.” In 2011, Copenhagen experienced a cloudburst – a very sudden and destructive rainstorm which unleashed months’ worth of rain over a few hours, leaving parts of the city under a meter of water. Damages were extensive, estimated at around $1 billion. The disaster supercharged the city’s climate plans. One of its responses is Enghaveparken – a huge “climate park.” The park, which dates back to 1928, was redesigned by architectural firm Tredje Natur (Third Nature). “It was kind of a catch 22 situation,” Fleming Rafn, a founding partner of Tredje Natur, told CNN. They had to work out how to preserve the park’s heritage, while preparing it for a future of more extreme climate events. The redesigned park, which lies at the bottom of a hill, is based on the idea of having chambers for water. A concrete hockey court was lowered 3 meters, and will be the starting point for containing flood water. After the court fills up, water can flow on to a sunken rose garden and finally to the lake. The park also has subterranean basins, which harvest rainwater from the neighborhood. A perimeter wall around the park will keep water contained and was built in a way that meant all the historical trees could remain where they were, Rafn said. In extreme 100-year events, the whole 35,000 square meters (380,000 square feet) of park can be filled with water from end to end, where it can be contained until floods have eased enough for the water to be released into the sewer system. The park can handle around 6 million gallons. The aim is to reconnect people with nature and the impacts of the climate crisis, Rafn said. “It’s so difficult for us to understand climate and our own relationship with it, and how do we as individuals actually participate in something that is this abstract, and I think making it tangible has a large promise in terms of making it more of a down-to-Earth discussion.”"

",Madison Richardson and CNN meteorologists Allison Chinchar and Monica Garrett,"A powerful Pacific storm continues to bring more rain, snow and damaging winds to California, a state already waterlogged from at least 12 atmospheric rivers that have delivered a barrage of rain and snow in recent months. Up to 3 inches of rain have fallen over the central California coast, and more is one the way Wednesday. Up to 4 feet snow is likely in the northern coastal mountain ranges and the Sierra by Wednesday. A slight, Level 2 of 4, risk for excessive rainfall remains across the central California coast through early Wednesday morning, with the expectation the risk will weaken throughout the day. At this time in a normal year, this type of atmospheric river storm would bring beneficial precipitation to the region. But given the unprecedented amount of rain and snow California has already received over a prolonged period, the storm will exacerbate flooding issues, bring down weakened trees and add more snow to already record levels. Cities including Oakland and Monterey are on track to hit records for rain in March by the end of this week. “Preceding storms have saturated soils which will result in trees coming down and the potential for more power outages,” National Weather Service meteorologist Roger Gass told CNN. “We still have road closures in the mountainous areas because of the sheer number of landslides and rockslides since we have been impacted by so many storm systems,” Gass said. The impacts of this storm are further complicated by strong winds. Nearly four million people were under a wind advisory in California and Oregon with gusts expected up to 55 mph Wednesday. Because of the strong winds, near whiteout conditions are possible in parts of Northern California near Mount Shasta, where 1 to 3 feet of snow could fall. Winter storm warnings are in effect for this region and other parts of California through Wednesday. Sections of Interstate 5 running from California into Oregon were closed Tuesday due to “severe winter conditions,” according to a tweet from the Oregon Department of Transportation. I-5 northbound is closed from Redding, California, to the border, ODOT said. Southbound traffic is closed from Ashland, Oregon, to the border. “This could be a long closure until conditions in CA improve,” the agency said. Statewide, the snowpack in California for the Sierras is currently at 228% of its normal amount for this time of year and this storm will only increase that margin. The Southern Sierras specifically have reached record levels, while the Central Sierra likely will by the end of the winter season. In response to the severe weather, California Gov. Gavin Newsom requested a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration and expanded the state of emergency to include additional counties impacted by storms that started in late February, his office said in a news release on Tuesday. The declaration request would help response and recovery for the counties of Calaveras, Kern, Los Angeles, Mariposa, Monterey, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Tulare, and Tuolumne, the release said. The governor also added Alameda, Marin, Modoc and Shasta counties to the state of emergency already covering 43 other counties, according to the news release. Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled the last name of NWS meteorologist Roger Gass. CNN’s Robert Shackelford, Andi Babineau and Taylor Romine contributed to this report."

","Hilary Whiteman, CNN","Melting ice in the Antarctic is not just raising sea levels but slowing down the circulation of deep ocean water with vast implications for the global climate and for marine life, a new study warns. Led by scientists from the University of New South Wales and published Wednesday in the journal Nature, the peer-reviewed study modeled the impact of melting Antarctic ice on deep ocean currents that work to flush nutrients from the sea floor to fish near the surface. Three years of computer modeling found the Antarctic overturning circulation – also known as abyssal ocean overturning – is on track to slow 42% by 2050 if the world continues to burn fossil fuels and produce high levels of planet-heating pollution. A slow down is expected to speed up ice melt and potentially end an ocean system that has helped sustain life for thousands of years. “The projections we have make it look like the Antarctic overturning would collapse this century,” said Matthew England, deputy director of the Australian Research Council’s Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science, who coordinated the study. “In the past, these overturning circulations changed over the course of 1,000 years or so, and we’re talking about changes within a few decades. So it is pretty dramatic,” he said. Most previous studies have focused on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the system of currents that carry warm water from the tropics into the North Atlantic. The cold, saltier water then sinks and flows south. Its Southern Ocean equivalent is less studied but does an important job moving nutrient-dense water north from Antarctica, past New Zealand and into the North Pacific Ocean, the North Atlantic and Indian Ocean, the report’s authors said in a briefing. The circulation of deep ocean water is considered vital for the health of the sea – and plays an important role in sequestering carbon absorbed from the atmosphere. According to the report, while a slowdown of the AMOC would mean the deep Atlantic Ocean would get colder, the slower circulation of dense water in the Antarctic means the deepest waters of the Southern Ocean will warm up. “One of the concerning things of this slowdown is that there can be feedback to further ocean warming at the base of the ice shelves around Antarctica. And that would lead to more ice melt, reinforcing or amplifying the original change,” England said. As global temperatures rise, Antarctic ice is expected to melt faster, but that doesn’t mean the circulation of deep water will increase – in fact the opposite, scientists said. In a healthy system, the cold and salty – or dense – consistency of melted Antarctic ice allows it to sink to the deepest layer of the ocean. From there it sweeps north, carrying carbon and higher levels of oxygen than might otherwise be present in water around 4,000 meters deep. As the current moves northward, it agitates deep layers of debris on the ocean floor – remains of decomposing sea life thick with nutrients – that feed the bottom of the food chain, scientists said. In certain areas, mostly south of Australia in the Southern Ocean and in the tropics, this nutrient-rich cold water moves toward the surface in a process called upwelling, distributing the nutrients to higher layers of the ocean, England said. However, Wednesday’s study found that as global temperatures warm, melting sea ice “freshens” the water around Antarctica, diluting its saltiness and raising its temperature, meaning it’s less dense and doesn’t sink to the bottom as efficiently as it once did. The report’s co-author, Steve Rintoul from Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Australian Antarctic Program Partnership, said sea life in waters worldwide rely on nutrients brought back up to the surface, and that the Antarctic overturning is a key component of that upwelling of nutrients. “We know that nutrients exported from the Southern Ocean in other current systems support about three quarters of global phytoplankton production – the base of the food chain,” he said. “We’ve shown that the sinking of dense water near Antarctica will decline by 40% by 2050. And it’ll be sometime between 2050 and 2100 that we start to see the impacts of that on surface productivity.” England added: “People born today are going to be around then. So, it’s certainly stuff that will challenge societies in the future.” The report’s authors say the slowing of the Antarctic ocean overturning has other knock-on effects for the planet – for example, it could shift rain bands in the tropics by as much as 1,000 kilometers (621 miles). “Shut it down completely and you get this reduction of rainfall in one band south of the equator and an increase in the band to the north. So we could see impacts on rainfall in the tropics,” said England. Earlier this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in its latest report that the impacts of rising global temperatures were more severe than expected. Without immediate and deep changes, the world is hurtling toward increasingly dangerous and irreversible consequences of climate change, it added. The IPCC report found that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels was still possible, but it’s becoming harder to achieve the longer the world fails to cut carbon pollution. England points out that the IPCC predictions don’t include ice melt from Antarctic ice sheets and shelves. “That’s a very significant component of change that’s already underway around Antarctica with more to come in the next few decades,” England said. Rintoul said the study was another urgent warning on top of all the ones that have come before it. “Even though the direct effect on fisheries through reduced nutrient supply might take decades to play out, we will commit ourselves to that future with the choices we make over the next decade.”"

Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action. Water cascading from a wall of ice with gray brushstrokes of clouds overhead makes for a beautiful image – but the story behind it is one of destruction; Earth’s glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate due to human-caused climate change. Canadian photographer Paul Nicklen remembers taking the photograph. It was August 2014, and temperatures in Svalbard, Norway, were unusually warm – hovering above 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). As he came around the corner of an ice cap on Nordaustlandet island, he saw more than a dozen waterfalls pouring off its face. “It was the most poetic, beautiful scene I’d ever seen, but it was also haunting and scary,” he recalls. The picture came to symbolize the realities of climate change and became Nicklen’s best-selling fine art image. It appeared multiple times in National Geographic, was used by Al Gore in his climate talks, and graced the cover of Pearl Jam’s 2020 album “Gigaton,” the title of which refers to the unit used to calculate ice mass. Its beauty is central to its impact, believes Nicklen. “When you take a photograph that is in focus, properly exposed, moody and powerful, it creates a visceral reaction,” he says. “It has to be beautiful and engaging, it has to invite you in … and it has to have a conservation message.” In 2014, Nicklen, along with his wife Cristina Mittermeier, and later joined by Andy Mann (both also award-winning photographers), co-founded the nonprofit organization SeaLegacy, which uses film and photography to raise awareness of climate issues and help protect the planet. “Photography is one of the most effective and powerful tools we have to tell complex stories, like the story of climate change,” says Mittermeier. She witnessed this power with one of her own photographs, taken in August 2017, which showed a starving polar bear. After being published in National Geographic, the photo and accompanying video went viral, shared on social media and by news organizations worldwide. It sparked a global conversation on climate change, provoking responses ranging from concern and empathy to climate denial. But there was no denying that it shook the world: “People still remember it and have strong reactions when they see it,” Mittermeier reflects. As guest editors for CNN’s Call to Earth series, Nicklen and Mittermeier selected these two images, along with eight others, that they believe have alerted the world to the climate crisis. Nicklen compares photographing climate change to photographing conflict. “We’re out there on the front lines of the war being waged against our planet. It’s emotionally draining, exhausting,” he says. In recent decades, as climate disasters have become more frequent and intense, images have more explicitly captured the urgency of the situation. Six dead giraffes, bodies emaciated from the lack of food and water, photographed by Ed Ram, show the horror of Kenya’s prolonged ongoing drought, which has threatened and displaced animals and humans alike. Photographs of wildfires, like those that ravaged Australia in 2019 and 2020, show the scale of devastation, with homes on fire and wildlife fleeing in despair. “They show that climate change isn’t just happening somewhere else, it’s happening everywhere,” says Mittermeier. “All of a sudden, it will come knocking a lot closer to your own door.” Mittermeier remembers the work of her friend and one of her great influences, Gary Braasch, who she describes as a “chronicler of climate change.” The photographer, who died in 2016, dedicated the last two decades of his life to documenting how the Earth was changing in response to global warming – from Antarctica, with its melting glaciers, to Bhola Island in Bangladesh, where sea level rise and increasing erosion have turned villages into islands. Braasch’s commitment to the cause blazed the way for Nicklen and Mittermeier’s generation of conservation photographers. At times however, climate change can be tediously slow to chronicle. Sea levels rise by a matter of millimeters each year – a barely visible increment despite happening at a faster rate than ever before. But such changes add up, and if they are visually documented over years or decades the impact becomes clear. “It’s like photographing a slow-moving tsunami,” says Mittermeier. “It’s often hard to see in the moment, but when two images are put side-by-side, it’s hard not to see the impact the climate crisis is having.” Read: Scientists are listening to glaciers to discover the secrets of the oceans The work of photographer James Balog has been crucial in creating the visual narrative of climate change, she says. Using a network of time-lapse cameras recording glaciers around the world, his Extreme Ice Survey has demonstrated how glaciers are vanishing over time. The extensive archive of photos of each glacier taken year-round at every daylight hour has also provided a baseline from which future changes can be measured. “It became just irrefutable proof,” says Mittermeier. “That was a very important moment for climate photography.” Mittermeier and Nicklen also selected images where humans and nature collide. One effect of climate change is a dramatic loss of biodiversity. Since 1970, wildlife populations have plummeted by 69%, due predominantly to land-use change that has fragmented crucial habitats, and also rising temperatures, which have led to mass mortality events, according to the WWF’s 2022 Living Planet Report. Read: The icy patience of an Arctic photographer With the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the globe, the ice that polar bears depend on is melting away. Dmitry Kokh’s photograph “House of Bears,” one of the winners of the 2022 Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, shows polar bears roaming an abandoned Soviet settlement on Kolyuchin Island. While the buildings had long been deserted, Mittermeier believes it points to the increasing problem of polar bears – with no ice left to hunt on – encroaching on human spaces and encountering local people, leading to tragic outcomes for both sides. The effects of climate change will – and are already – hitting animals and humans alike. “It’s impossible to deny that we are all in this together,” says Mittermeier. “We are all impacted in devastating ways, and we cannot separate ourselves from the life we share this planet with.” The series “The Day May Break” from photographer Nick Brandt portrays this by showing people and animals affected by environmental destruction. The photographs, taken in animal sanctuaries around the world, feature people that have been displaced by climate change events such as drought or floods, and animals that have been victims of habitat destruction or wildlife trafficking. Portraying both in the same frame shows how deeply our fates are intertwined. Among the images of devastation and displacement, there are also those that signify hope. In Brandt’s work, he points out that the subjects of the images, both people and animals, are survivors – “And therein lies hope and possibility,” he wrote in an email. Read: The ocean’s ‘blue carbon’ can be our secret weapon in fighting climate change For Mittermeier and Nicklen, and SeaLegacy as a whole, striking a message of hope is vital to the wider mission. “Martin Luther King didn’t start his famous speech by reminding us that we live in a nightmare – he told us what the dream is,” says Mittermeier. “You have to point out what it is that we’re aspiring to and show where the hope is.” The hope, she believes, is in wildlife and the ocean. Humans are just waking up to the role that both play in mitigating climate change, and restoring nature will be crucial in averting the crisis. For Mittermeier, her photograph of a sea lion rising up to the surface in the Galapagos – one of the largest marine protected areas in the world – shows how ocean life can flourish with the right protection. And Nicklen’s photograph of a bowhead whale represents to him one of our greatest allies in decarbonization: not only are whales’ bodies enormous stores of carbon, their feces fuels phytoplankton which soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. By showing off the beauty of the planet, the couple believe they can show people it is still worth fighting for. “We’re trying to climb to the tallest mountain and scream from the mountaintops that this planet is dying, and that we are at risk,” says Nicklen. “But the only emotion greater than fear is hope,” adds Mittermeier. “And the only way you can feel hope is if you take action.”"

And in 2021, it launched its call for the UN International Court of Justice to provide an “advisory opinion” on the legal responsibility of governments to fight the climate crisis, arguing that climate change has become a human rights issue for Pacific Islanders. Although the advisory opinion will be non-binding, it will carry significant weight and authority and could inform climate negotiations as well as future climate lawsuits around the world. It could also strengthen the position of climate-vulnerable countries in international negotiations. This year has already been rough for Vanuatu: It is currently under a six-month state of emergency after a rare pair of Category 4 cyclones pummeled the country within 48 hours during the first week of March. The islands’ residents are still picking their way through the storms’ rubble. Wednesday’s resolution for an advisory opinion passed by majority, backed by more than 130 countries. Two of the world’s largest climate polluters, the US and China, did not express support, but did not object meaning the measure passed by consensus. This is the first time the highest international court is called on to address the climate crisis. The landmark decision is “essential,” UN Secretary General António Guterres said in his remarks to the assembly. “Climate justice is both a moral imperative and a prerequisite for effective global climate action.” Advisory opinions have “tremendous importance and can have a long-standing impact on the international legal order,” Guterres said. “Today we have witnessed a win for climate justice of epic proportions,” said Ishmael Kalsakau, prime minister of Vanuatu, soon after the resolution was adopted. “The very fact that a small Pacific island nation like Vanuatu was able to successfully spearhead such a transformative outcome speaks to the incredible support from all corners of the globe.” Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s minister of climate change adaptation, told CNN that he hopes the opinion would be “greatly persuasive in terms of increasing domestic action and identifying what gaps in international law and domestic law need to be filled.” “It is quite historic,” he added. The push to seek an advisory opinion from the world’s highest court began in an environmental law class in Fiji in 2019. Cynthia Houniuhi, president of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, said she and her peers had been looking for ways to address the climate crisis head-on through various international legal pathways, until they decided on the International Court of Justice. “To be honest, at first, I was very hesitant when this idea was discussed,” Houniuhi said. “My mind keeps telling me to back off. I mean, let’s be real here, it was too ambitious to say the least. Like, how can a small group of students from the Pacific Region convince the majority of the UN members to support this unique initiative?” But as Pacific Island nations continue to suffer from hotter temperatures and more droughts, rising sea levels, and increasingly intense cyclones, Houniuhi realized they needed to do this. “What is the use of learning all this knowledge if it’s not for people to fight the single greatest threat to their security?” she said. “For me, the memories of my childhood growing up in my village with my people are slowly fading, as the environment that sustained us disintegrates before our eyes.” Tropical cyclones are not rare in Oceania, but Vanuatu, which has the highest disaster risk in the world, suffers disproportionately highly. Scientists say these storms are intensifying as the planet warms and will continue to carry a tremendous economic toll. According to Regenvanu, the financial damage caused by the recent twin cyclones will likely amount to more than half of Vanuatu’s GDP. “It’s an enormous impact,” he said. “We just have to try to recover, rebuild, all the while knowing that we are coming up to the next climate impact.” To get support for their idea, the Pacific Island students passed around a petition that garnered signatures from teachers and students. And while campaigning for the initiative, they drafted a letter and proposal that they sent to Pacific Island governments. After receiving positive feedback from Vanuatu, the student members met with Regenvanu, who was the foreign affairs minister at the time. “I could empathize with them, and I share their convictions and passions,” Regenvanu said. “I was very happy to receive that proposal and to commit to advancing it.” The Vanuatu government kept its word, endorsing the proposal and taking it to the international stage. “It was history in the making,” Houniuhi said. “I don’t want to show a picture to my child one day of my island. I want my child to be able to experience the same environment in the same culture that I grew up in.” During last year’s UN Climate Week in New York City, a group of Pacific Islander climate activists amped up the pressure on UN leaders, who were gathering for the annual UN General Assembly to discuss climate change-related matters. Along the East River in front of the UN headquarters, students and climate activists sailed in a flotilla of boats, flying the flags of more than a dozen Pacific Island nations while calling on leaders to vote “yes” to their request for an advisory opinion. The momentum continued two months later at the UN’s COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where world leaders and negotiators agreed to create a loss and damage fund, which Vanuatu first proposed back in 1991. The idea is that rich countries — which have contributed the most to climate change with their planet-warming pollution — should pay poorer nations to recover from the resulting disasters. “It’s a great injustice when you see oil companies make billions in profits when countries like ours in the Pacific are looking for and seeking support for climate adaptation and mitigation,” said Lavetanalagi Seru, Fijian climate activist and regional policy coordinator with the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network. “And now, we are living through an era of loss and damage.” While the advisory opinion is separate from loss and damage, Regenvanu said they are both rooted in climate justice. Having an advisory opinion from the highest court would provide legal clarity of how a loss and damage fund would work. “The ICJ advisory opinion will come at a the right time to help us define what loss and damage means [and] how it will work,” he said. Regenvanu said Vanuatu’s request brings attention to the legal avenues small countries can take to fend off the worsening effects of the climate crisis. “While the Paris Agreement is an essential part of the international legal framework for climate action, it is certainly not the only instrument … nor is it the most legally enforceable,” Regenvanu said. It could still take around 18 months for an opinion to be issued, with countries able to provide input into the process. The climate change minister will now head home to Vanuatu, where he said he will rejoin the ongoing relief efforts after the recent storms. “We’re basically constantly in a state of recovery in response to climate disasters,” Regenvanu said. “This is why we are so passionate on the climate change front, because this is our reality, and we need to deal with it, and we need other countries to assist us to deal with it.”"

The European Union reached a provisional deal to increase its renewable energy targets, an important pillar of the bloc’s plans to fight climate change and end dependence on Russian fossil fuels. And the United Kingdom released its long-awaited climate strategy, promising “an energy revolution.” Negotiators from the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, which represents EU member states, agreed that by 2030, the 27-country bloc would commit to sourcing 42.5% of its energy from renewable sources like wind and solar, with a potential top-up to 45%. The European Union’s current target is for a 32% renewable energy share by 2030. In 2021, the bloc got 22% of its energy from renewable sources, though the level varied significantly between countries. Sweden leads with a 63% renewable energy share, while in Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Ireland, renewable sources make up less than 13% of total energy use. A rapid shift to renewable energy is crucial if the European Union is to meet its climate goals, including a legally binding aim to cut levels of planet-heating gases by 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels. Renewable energy targets have gained significance since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The European Union has vowed to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2027 and plans to do this mostly through locally produced, low-carbon energy. Reaching the new goals will require massive investment in wind and solar farms, scaling up production of renewable gases, and reinforcing Europe’s power grids to integrate more clean energy. The European Commission has said additional investments of 113 billion euros ($123 billion) in renewable energy and hydrogen infrastructure will be needed by 2030, if EU countries are to end their reliance on Russian fossil fuels. Thursday’s deal must be approved by the European Parliament and EU countries to become law, normally a formality. The United Kingdom also announced its own climate strategy Thursday. The plan sets out a pathway for the nation to reach net zero — which means removing from the air at least as much planet-heating pollution as it emits. The strategy focuses on clean energy technologies, and energy security in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. It includes support for offshore wind energy, electric vehicles, green hydrogen, nuclear technology, home insulation and home heat pumps. The strategy also emphasizes carbon capture and storage, which traps and stores carbon pollution. While many scientists say this technology will be crucial for meeting climate goals, it has also been heavily criticized for allowing polluters to continue polluting, rather than cutting their emissions. UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt said in a statement: “Transforming our energy system is no longer just about tackling climate change, it is also a matter of national security. To protect ourselves from future price spikes, we need to accelerate the move to cleaner, cheaper, home-grown energy.” The strategy announcement comes after a UK court ruled last year that the government had not adequately set out how it intended to reach net zero. It also follows the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate investment in American history, which has kick-started a global green subsidies race. Some have criticized the UK government’s new plans as weak. Pauline Chetcuti, head of policy at the non-profit Oxfam, said in a statement that they are “tinkering around the edges but are far off the mark for the scale of the challenge we face.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/01/world/el-nino-forecast-weather-climate-impacts/index.html,The oceans just reached their hottest temperature on record as El Niño looms. Here are 6 things to watch for,04/01/2023,"                                                 It’s unclear how strong the coming El Niño will be – some models predict it could reach super-strength, others suggest it will be more moderate.                                             ","Laura Paddison and Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Scientists have watched in astonishment as ocean temperatures have steadily risen over the past several years – even as the cooling La Niña phenomenon had a firm grip on the Pacific. The oceans have been record-warm for the past four years, scientists reported in January. Then in mid-March, climatologists noted that global sea surface temperature climbed to a new high. The incredible trend worries experts about what could lie ahead, especially as forecasts predict El Niño is on its way starting this summer – and along with it, impacts like extreme heat, dangerous tropical cyclones and a significant threat to fragile coral reefs. La Niña and El Niño are natural phenomena in the tropical Pacific Ocean; La Niña is marked by cooler-than-average ocean temperatures, while El Niño brings warmer-than-average temperatures. Both have major influence weather across the globe. And a switch to El Niño will almost assuredly bring warmer global temperatures along with it. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles, said there is already a “dramatic transition” from La Niña to El Niño happening in the tropical Pacific. “Right now, the atmosphere and the ocean are both in sync and screaming ‘El Niño rapid development’ over the next few months,” he said. The last three years have still been some of the warmest on record, even with La Niña’s cooling effect.  “We’re now switching that off,” Professor Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at the UK Met Office, told CNN. It’s unclear how strong the coming El Niño will be – some models predict it could reach super-strength, others suggest it will be more moderate. But what is clear is that, layered on top of human-caused global heating, the signs point to El Niño ushering in severe and unprecedented impacts for many parts of the world. Here are six weather and climate extremes to look out for. El Niño could – for the first time – push the world past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above the pre-industrial levels of the mid-to-late 1800s. Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees – compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically. A strong El Niño could push the planet to that point, Scaife said, even if only temporarily. “We will probably have, in 2024, the warmest year globally on record,” Josef Ludescher a senior scientist at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told CNN. The hottest year on record is currently 2016, which followed a very strong El Niño. The world has already seen around 1.2 degrees of warming, as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and produce planet-heating pollution. And despite three years of cooling La Niña, temperatures have soared to dangerous levels. Europe saw its hottest summer in 2022, with temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and Pakistan and India experienced a searing heatwave, where parts of the country reached more than 49 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit). Ultimately, whether the 1.5-degree threshold is hit or narrowly missed “doesn’t really matter,” Scaife said. “It’s the first time in human history that that value is within reach – and that’s the really significant point.” Whatever the exact level of heating El Niño brings, some of its impacts – including extreme temperatures – are very likely to be unprecedented, Scaife said. “Each time we now get an El Niño, it’s adding on to an ever-larger amount of global warming that we’ve accrued.” California has seen an onslaught of rain and snow in recent months. That could intensify during El Niño. California already faces potential flood threats this spring, NOAA reported in March, after record-breaking snow fell in the Sierra and torrential rain drenched the rest of the state. Once El Niño kicks in, much of the state will likely see an elevated chance of above-normal rainfall with an increased risk of flooding, landslides and coastal erosion, experts told CNN. It could even deliver “meaningful drought relief” to the Colorado River Basin, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the US Department of Agriculture. “Whereas La Niña is historically a ‘drought maker’ for the continental United States, El Niño is a ‘drought breaker,’” Rippey told CNN. “Although the exact location of drought, or lack thereof, varies considerably from event to event.” The situation on the Colorado River, which provides water for drinking, irrigation and electricity for roughly 40 million people across the Southwest, has been plagued by overuse and a climate change-fueled drought. The water crisis has become so dire that the federal government announced never-before-seen mandatory water cuts in the last two years. Jon Gottschalck, a head forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, echoed Rippey, noting that a stronger and extended Pacific jet stream — fast-flowing air currents in the upper atmosphere that influence day-to-day weather — could “elevate odds for atmospheric river-type events for the West Coast,” while also causing more intense precipitation in the South. In other parts of the world, El Niño could amplify droughts, fierce heatwaves and dangerous wildfires. South Africa and India are at risk of drought and extreme heat, as are nations near the West Pacific including Indonesia, Australia and Pacific island nations such as Vanuatu and Fiji. For Australia – still reeling from extensive flooding – El Niño is likely to bring much drier, hotter weather, especially in the eastern areas of the country. Since 1900, 18 of the 27 El Niño years have meant widespread winter and spring drought, a spokesperson for Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology told CNN. Its recent floods have also increased fears for a particularly destructive bushfire season, as increased vegetation growth could provide fuel for fires as the weather gets drier and hotter. India, too, is bracing itself for the impacts of El Niño, which can weaken the monsoon that brings the rainfall it relies on for filling aquifers and growing crops. The monsoon tends to be most affected when there is a flip from a La Niña winter, which we have just seen, to an El Niño summer, which the 2023 summer is likely to be, said Raghu Murtugudde, an Earth systems scientist at the University of Maryland. “The overall [monsoon rainfall] deficit can be as high as 15%,” he told CNN. El Niño could also push up temperatures in India, which is already experiencing unusually early heatwaves. It’s a “compound hazard because heat waves and El Niño tend to delay the onset of the monsoon,” said Kieren Hunt, a research scientist at the University of Reading in England. Months of dry spells would “put a tremendous strain on water security,” he said. One of the first fingerprints of El Niño, according to Gottschalck, will be evident in the changes in tropical cyclone activity. Unlike La Niña, El Niño tends to reduce Atlantic hurricane activity, but creates the opposite effect in the Pacific, where warm waters can fuel more intense typhoons. “Tropical cyclones can often form further west in the basin and remain stronger longer and so potential impacts to Hawaii are increased,” Gottschalck said. This means “more chances of landfall and remotely driven impacts, such as stronger and longer duration seas, heavy rainfall, and more.” Elsewhere in the Pacific, Swain said models show “very warm waters” off the coast of Peru that are already bringing in unusually heavy precipitation and flooding in the deserts. “That is a classic precursor to a significant El Niño event.” As El Niño forms and strengthens later this year, Peru could be at even greater risk of more flooding. The government is already set to invest more than $1 billion on climate and weather measures to prevent the worst consequences. El Niño is an ocean heater, and warmer water is bad news for coral reefs. When they get too hot, corals will spit out the algae living within their tissue, which provides them with both their color and most of their energy. This causes corals to turn white – in a phenomenon called bleaching. While they can recover if temperatures eventually cool, bleaching puts them at higher risk of starvation and death. A particularly catastrophic period of coral bleaching happened between 2014 and 2017 – hitting every major reef on earth. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef saw nearly 30% of its corals die in a record-breaking marine heatwave in 2016 – which followed a very strong El Niño that started in 2015. More mass bleaching events have followed, and with El Niño on the horizon, scientists are increasingly concerned about the impacts on coral that has simply not had enough time to recover. “What’s being predicted here is very scary,” said Peter Houk, a professor at the University of Guam Marine Laboratory who studies coral in Micronesia. “Every time one comes it grows a little bit more in intensity.” El Niño doesn’t necessarily mean that all coral will be affected, Houk said. Each El Niño is different and there are always other natural climate patterns at play. “But when it does happen, it’s brutal,” he said. Whenever it arrives, El Niño is going to be a chance to learn more about how coral reacts and where pockets of resilience might appear, Houk said. He just wants it to hold off a bit longer. “We hope that the predictions are wrong and then we can buy a few more years for the corals to recover.” Antarctic ice is already in trouble and El Niño could make it worse. Earlier this year, ice levels on the continent dipped to record-breaking lows for the second time in two years, sparking fear that after years of ups and downs, it could now be on a steep downward trend. El Niño could help speed up this process, according to recent research, which found a link between the strength and frequency of El Niño events and the speed of Antarctic ice melt. “Models that project a greater increase in El Niño systematically produce a faster ice sheet melt than models that projected a smaller change in El Niño,” Wenju Cai, chief research scientist at CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, told CNN. Scientists are watching Antarctica closely because it holds such a catastrophic amount of water in its ice. Though the Antarctic ice sheet is unlikely to melt completely, it has enough water in it to raise global sea level by 230 feet (70 meters). In the immediate term, El Niño events have divergent impacts across Antarctica, Cai said, with increases and decreases in different areas. But taken together, he said, the trend is clear – “an overall sea ice decrease.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/us/california-april-snow-survey-water-climate/index.html,What a difference a year makes: From nearly no snow to a potentially record-breaking pile-up in California,04/04/2023,"                                                 After a remarkable series of winter storms, California water officials reported Monday in their April snow survey the Sierra snowpack is among the largest on record, dating back to the 1950s.                                             ","Stephanie Elam and Rachel Ramirez, CNN","After a remarkable series of winter storms, California water officials reported Monday in their April snow survey the Sierra snowpack is among the largest on record, dating back to the 1950s. The state’s Department of Water Resources surveys mountain snowpack once a month through the winter, and the April survey is usually the most consequential. Officials use the measurement to forecast the state’s water resources for the rest of the year. Last year’s survey was pitifully low. Water officials had just a small patch of shallow snow to measure after a disappointing winter. The snow depth on April 2 was just 2.5 inches – part of a disastrous multiyear dry spell that triggered water cuts across the state. But what a difference a year makes. Twelve months later, the mountains are now loaded with white gold. South of Lake Tahoe at Phillips Station, as snowflakes fell from the surrounding hills, officials measured a snow depth of 126.5 inches and a snow water equivalent – how much liquid water the snow holds – of 54 inches. Snowpack in the California Sierra is 221% of normal for this location at this time of year, officials at the Department of Water Resources said. Statewide, snowpack is averaging 237% compared to normal for the date – a significant boost after the back-to-back storms. Sean de Guzman, snow survey manager for the state Department of Water Resources, said this is the “deepest snowpack” he has personally ever measured, noting that there have only been three other years when California snowpack has been greater than 200% of average in April. “This year is going to join that list and be another year well above 200% of average,” de Guzman told journalists at a briefing Monday. “We still are waiting for more snow data and snow survey results to come in from our various cooperators and partners. But as of this morning, as of right now, it’s looking like this year, statewide snowpack will most likely be either the first- or second-biggest snowpack on record dating back to 1950.” Snowpack in the Sierra is critical to the state’s water resources. The snow acts as a natural reservoir – melting into rivers and human-made reservoirs through the spring and summer – and accounts for 30% of California’s freshwater supply in an average year. The state’s largest reservoirs, which were recently at critically low levels, have been replenished and are running higher than their historical averages. While the heavy rains caused widespread flash flooding and several feet of snow trapped residents in their homes in the higher elevations, the deluge of snow and rain has largely improved California soil moisture and streamflow levels after being gripped by the drought for so long. California Gov. Gavin Newsom last month also announced the removal of some drought restrictions, while the Department of Water Resources said it will increase the amount of water deliveries to 75% of requested water supplies this year – up from the initial plan of only 5% last year. “Even though we have this extraordinary snowpack, we know that the droughts are getting deeper and more frequent, and that means we have to use water efficiently no matter what are hydrologic conditions,” Department of Water Resources Director Karla Nemeth said. “And the governor has emphasized that as the path forward for California, and to make sure that we are resilient as an economy and for our environment that we all continue to use water wisely in the state.” To find out just how much snow the Sierra Nevada were buried under this winter, Airborne Snow Observatories Inc., which provides its data to California’s Department of Water Resources, flies over the range to gauge what’s fallen. “We measure snowpack wall-to-wall over mountains from aircraft using lasers and spectrometers,” said Tom Painter, the company’s CEO. “From that information, we can then know the full distribution of how much water there is in a mountain snowpack and also how fast it’s going to melt. That’s allowed us then to change forecast errors from being pretty large to very small and really dramatically changed water management in the west.” The planes fly for about six hours at a time, collecting different kinds of data through open portals in the belly of their planes, which they process and deliver within about 72 hours to help municipalities allocate water resources, generate hydroelectricity and meet environmental metrics. “The scanning LIDAR is a fancy laser pointer, essentially, that sprays out laser pulses – about 500,000 pulses per second – flying along at 23,000 feet, and measures how long it takes for the laser pulse to go out, hit the surface and come back,” Painter said. “And we can use that information to then know the surface of the snow. Every square foot of mountain snow is touched by our lasers.” The scientists then compare this data to when they’ve flown over the same area when there wasn’t any snow. “The difference between those two is snow depth,” Painter explained. “Depth times density is equal to what’s called snow water equivalent, which is the most important water metric out there that allows civilization to exist in the Western US. It really is the mountain snowpack that drives all of this civilization.” The year-to-year difference couldn’t be starker, Painter said, adding that this year, there will be snow in the Sierra into the summer. Last year, the company ended its flyover season in late May; this year, they expect to be flying until August. For the Tuolumne River Basin around Yosemite National Park – which supplies water to San Francisco and other Bay Area municipalities – imagery from last year this time is mostly dark blue: barely any snow. This year, the same area is swathed in orange, yellow and white, indicating snow depths of 10 to 20 feet. On Mammoth Mountain in the eastern Sierra, about 60 feet of snow has fallen this year, breaking the old record set in 2010. And snow depths have reached more than 100 feet in some areas around Mammoth. The amount of snow is so profound that the resort has already announced that the ski season will last through the end of July this year. “It’s fascinating to look at how the cliffs up on the upper mountain have really gotten buried and the gullies between them are filling in to where they just are kind of disappearing,” Painter noted, adding that he’s never seen Mammoth Mountain this covered. Despite all the rain and snow that has boosted reservoirs and allowed officials to lift some water restrictions, scientists still say drought concerns are a priority as climate change continues to impact California’s weather. “The climate models had already been predicting what it is that we are seeing now, which is this hydroclimate whiplash where we’re going from really dry years to really wet years,” Painter said, adding that this whiplash is hard on water managers. “That means we could very well have a dry year next year. No one really knows.” And as temperatures warm again as summer approaches, experts warn more flood threats lie ahead as the snow melts. California water officials said that after today, they plan to shift their focus “from snowpack building to snowpack melting,” and actively support emergency flood protection efforts. “We’re now heading into another issue of increasing solar radiation and chances of warm nights and lack of refreeze, and that brings up snowmelt flooding concerns,” said Benjamin Hatchett, researcher at the Desert Research Institute. “That’s going to be something to think about as we move into the spring, summer with this colossal snowpack sitting above us.” Hatchett also warns not to get “caught up in all these benefits,” and consider what all this water can mean for vegetation growth and wildfire fuel. “As things start to dry out and get warmer, this is a good year to really think about what’s going to happen, what’s growing, and how can you deal with [the fuels] to reduce your fire risk in upcoming seasons,” Hatchett said. Even with California’s historic snowpack this year, the state still pulls about a third of its water needs for the southern part of the state from the Colorado River Basin, where the snowfall totals improved this year, but were not as strong as the numbers posted in California. The country’s largest reservoirs – Lake Powell and Lake Mead – in the Colorado River Basin are still hovering at or near-record-low levels following years of drought and overuse. But it could also improve in the coming months as snowpack levels rise in the region. “That’s good news for a very strained and stressed system,” Hatchett said. “But we probably need five, six or maybe 10 more years of this to really make a big dent in the situation there, but this is much more encouraging to see.” In California, water officials will head back to Phillips Station in May to measure more snow. The last time a May snow survey was necessary was in 2020, when the drought began. The difference between last year and this year in California is significant. And although the state has all this excess of water now, climate experts warn that drought is always looming, especially in a drier, hotter and thirstier world. Nemeth said there is much more work to be done to prepare and “adapt to our new climate realities.” “You really get a sense of the extreme nature of our climate here in California,” she said. “There’s lots of fascinating research around the degree to which climate has been driving the intensity of these storms, but also the very rapid shift from very dry to very wet.” “It is truly an extraordinary moment,” she said. “But we don’t get to stop and enjoy that for too long.”"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico is belching out significantly higher levels of potent, planet-heating gas than previously thought, according to new research, which found the climate effects of the operations are twice that of official estimates. The report comes as the Biden administration last month put millions of acres of water in the Gulf of Mexico up for auction to offshore oil and gas drilling, and has plans for further auctions. In August 2020, scientists spent 10 days doing airborne surveys of more than 50 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Flying in concentric rings around the facilities, they measured plumes of carbon pollution from burning processes as well as methane pollution from leaks and venting. They combined the findings with previous emissions surveys and inventories to calculate the “carbon intensity” of oil and gas operations – the total amount of planet-warming pollution released for each unit of energy produced. Their results revealed a climate impact twice as large as that estimated by government inventories, driven by high levels of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in its first two decades in the atmosphere. Methane pollution in the Gulf of Mexico totaled 600,000 metric tons a year, according to the report, which found that average methane levels in federal waters were three times higher than official inventories, and 13 times higher in state waters. “Inventories are generally challenged by methane,” Alan Gorchov Negron, a study co-author and climate science researcher at the University of Michigan, told CNN. Unlike carbon pollution, which comes from burning the fuel, methane from oil and gas operations escapes into the atmosphere – either through deliberate venting and flaring or accidentally through dilapidated equipment or unknown leaks. The study found that the worst climate performers were platforms in shallow waters, which include older style “central-hub platforms” that collect oil and gas from smaller platforms for processing. These have an “extraordinarily high” carbon intensity that far exceeds that of deeper water facilities, according to the report’s authors. There are multiple reasons for this outsized climate impact of shallow-water platforms, according to the report, including persistent venting, emissions associated with equipment as well as the tendency of the facilities to be older and sometimes poorly maintained. Even though shallow-water oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico have declined since 2000, the facilities will still likely have an impact for years to come, especially as these areas are included in prospective lease sales, the report noted. There is an upside to identifying their high levels of pollution, said Eric Kort, a report co-author and associate professor in climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan. “The good news is that the bulk of emissions comes from one class of facilities, which means mitigation measures can be more targeted,” he told CNN. The report outlines a series of measures to tackle planet-warming pollution from offshore oil and gas, including replacing venting with efficient flaring, refurbishing and repairing equipment, and plugging and abandoning platforms which cannot be repaired or improved. The study’s findings may be particularly pertinent, Negron said, as “the Gulf of Mexico is on the eve of a series of expansions in production.” The Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate and energy bill signed into law last year, includes provisions inserted by Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, for more of the Gulf of Mexico to be made available for oil and gas drilling. Manchin has argued the US should ramp up its oil and gas drilling to become more energy independent, especially as gas prices rise. There are up to 10 new lease sales proposed between now and 2028, according to the report. Climate considerations must legally be factored into decisions on drilling. In 2022, a federal judge invalidated an 80-million-acre oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico for not taking climate impacts into account, after a coalition of environmental groups sued the Biden administration. “This discussion around carbon intensity in the Gulf of Mexico will pop up in at least 10 more environmental impact statements,” Negron said. Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, said: “This study underscores what we’ve long known to be true: offshore drilling in the Gulf puts coastal communities at risk and threatens devastating and irreversible harm to our climate.” “The Biden administration should take this alarming data seriously and protect our climate and communities by putting an end to all new leasing in the Gulf,” he told CNN."

And almost every year, they find them shrinking. This year was no different. At the end of March, the team of scientists spent eight hours flying over the peaks, taking thousands of photographs of glaciers for the annual snowline survey. Andrew Mackintosh, a professor at Monash University in Australia who was on the flight, said in a statement that he was “shocked” by what they saw. Some of the smaller elevation glaciers had largely disappeared, he said, while the famous Franz Josef and Fox glaciers showed marked signs of retreat. “The observations this year reinforce the view that we are continuing to see ice loss across the Southern Alps,” Andrew Lorrey, principal scientist at the research body National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and coordinator of the survey, told CNN. Glaciers are huge masses of ice that build up in and around mountains. They grow in cold, snowy winters and retreat when temperatures warm. Glaciers are fresh water sources for nearly 2 billion people globally, but their rapid melting poses a huge risk: not only is it increasing the risk for deadly flash flooding, the melting ice is driving sea level rise. Two years of severe, record-breaking heat have taken a toll on the glaciers – 2022 was New Zealand’s hottest year ever, beating a record that was set just a year earlier. But the trend of declining ice is long term. It’s difficult to witness, said Lorrey, who has been on these aerial surveys since 2009. “I’m seeing this beautiful part of our natural environment slipping through our fingers. And if you’ve experienced a glacier firsthand, they are absolutely breathtaking and mind-blowing and life-altering.” The snowline survey, organized by NIWA, has happened almost every year for nearly five decades and aims to capture a snapshot of a set of more than 50 glaciers – ranging in size and elevation – as close as possible to the end of snow and ice melt season. The scientists are looking specifically at the snow that coats them. By understanding where the snowline is “you capture something about the health of our glaciers,” Lorrey said. The snow, which provides a nourishing and protective layer for the glaciers, starts in the autumn and continues until spring. Lorrey has a financial analogy for the process: The snow is like a savings deposit for the glacier, a buffer against the warmer period ahead. When the melt season starts in the spring, it has to go through this “savings account” of new snow before it reaches the body of the glacier. In years when the snowline is lower on the mountain, the glacier can bulk up and is able to advance further down the slope – it has a healthy balance. But when the snowline is higher up, more of the glacier is exposed to melting – sending it into the red – and it will shrink. “Right now, we see rapid changes happening in the mountains, with indications that the snowline rise is accelerating along with ice loss,” Lorrey said. The results from this year’s flight will be fed into a report on longer term variability in the glaciers which will come out later in the year. The climate crisis is having a huge impact. “It’s mostly temperature changes that drive what glaciers in New Zealand are doing,” Lauren Vargo, a glaciologist at the Victoria University of Wellington, who was part of the survey, told CNN. The extreme melting in 2018, one of the worst years on record for New Zealand’s glaciers, was made up to 10 times more likely by climate change, according to a 2020 study co-authored by Vargo and Lorrey. As a scientist, at first the dramatic change in the glaciers “was exciting” in some ways, said Vargo, who has been studying them since 2016. But the persistence of this trend is tough. “It also feels sad and scary when you think about what’s driving it,” she said. “As the current warming trend continues, we will keep losing more glaciers,” said Lorrey. And this is a global trend. Up to half the world’s glaciers could disappear by the end of the century, even if ambitious climate targets are met, according to research published in January. In addition to the impacts of climate change, natural climate variations have also played a role. The unusually long run of La Niña years, which have just ended, brought warmer-than-average sea and air temperatures, helping to drive glacier melting. Its counterpart, El Niño, which often brings cooler conditions to this part of New Zealand, is forecast for later in the year and may provide a temporary reprieve. “I always look forward to an El Niño and seeing a snow line that is where it normally should be,” Lorrey said. But, he cautioned, “it’s not going to save the bacon of the glaciers.” These years “occur too few and far between to counteract the ongoing warming trend that we’ve been experiencing.” The loss of ice is is keenly felt, Vargo said. “People in New Zealand have this connection to the glaciers.” Where once it was possible to park in the car park of a national park and walk a short distance to touch a glacier, now that’s much less common – people often need to go further into the mountain, even fly there on small planes. “It’s an experience that will be out of reach for many,” Lorrey said. “A loss of our glaciers will have a significant impact on our relationship with and experiences in the environment.” These “water towers,” as Lorrey calls them, also have an important role in supplying high Alpine streams, especially during years of drought. The shifts that are happening are a reminder that our mountains – and other places around the world – are changing quickly, he said. Glaciers are a “a highly visual element of environmental change that tells us there are other things that we are not seeing.”"

","Ella Nilsen and Sam Fossum, CNN","The US Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to release strict new proposed federal emissions standards for light-duty vehicles that, if implemented, would move the US car market decisively toward electric vehicles over the next decade. The EPA is considering emissions standards that could make up to two-thirds of new passenger vehicles sold in the US electric by 2032, according to a source familiar with the proposal. If implemented, the new greenhouse gas performance standards would start for light-duty vehicles that are model year 2027 and gradually increase through model year 2032. By 2032, the rules would ensure that 64% to 67% of all new-car sales in the US would be electric vehicles, according to the source. The EPA’s proposal, which was first reported by The New York Times, comes after California air regulators voted last year to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and set interim targets to phase these cars out. EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll did not comment on the specifics of the proposal but said the agency is working on developing new standards “to accelerate the transition to a zero-emissions transportation future, protecting people and the planet,” as directed by a previous executive order from President Joe Biden. “Once the interagency review process is completed, the proposals will be signed, published in the Federal Register, and made available for public review and comment,” Carroll said. The new rules could come as soon as Wednesday. The EPA proposal is a monumental step toward zero-emissions vehicles, coming as the US tries to keep up with other countries racing toward EV adoption, one expert told CNN. “I believe it’s pretty doable,” said Margo Oge, chair of the International Council on Clean Transportation and a former Obama EPA official. “The industry is there. Europe is ahead of the US, China is ahead of Europe, and these companies are global companies.” Oge noted that in the US, California is already proposing 70% new zero-emissions vehicle sales by 2030 and other states are planning to adopt California’s rules – meaning much of the US car industry will be transitioning ahead of any proposed federal rule. Still, the EPA’s proposal takes a different approach from California’s policy. Whereas California is mandating car companies sell a certain percentage of electric vehicles, the EPA would gradually raise greenhouse gas emissions standards to increasingly stringent levels from 2027 to 2032, pushing the industry toward electric vehicles to meet those high standards. The EPA rule would ensure that the rest of the country and the US car industry would follow California’s lead, Oge said. Biden has made electrifying the cars that Americans drive a key part of his climate goals. In 2021, the president set a new target that half of all vehicles sold in the US by 2030 would be battery electric, fuel-cell electric or plug-in hybrid. The US Treasury Department is set to release rules for new federal electric vehicle tax credits on April 18. While these tax credits are complex and could take time for consumers to take full advantage of, experts hope they will help accelerate the transition to EVs in the US. “Given the industry, the [Inflation Reduction Act] and what companies are doing globally, I just don’t see this number as being out of reach,” Oge said. The proposed EPA rules will go through a lengthy public comment process and could be changed before they are finalized."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/10/us/colorado-river-water-cuts-winter-snow-climate/index.html,"Did this winter solve the Colorado River crisis? No – but it took some pressure off, for now",04/10/2023,                                                 The Colorado River water crisis is not solved. But state water officials feel the blockbuster winter means they shouldn’t have to make severe cuts.                                             ,"Ella Nilsen, CNN; Photographs by Will Lanzoni, CNN","Across the Southwest, the signs of a phenomenal winter are everywhere. Snow blankets the tops of the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles. And in downtown Phoenix, the Salt and Verde rivers are full. After three years of record-breaking drought and plummeting water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell, water officials and experts across the West are now looking at more snow and water than they can handle. While many are not ready to declare the crisis on the Colorado River solved, they feel the blockbuster winter means basin states should no longer have to cut up to 25% of the basin’s water usage that was called for last year by Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, the river’s top federal official. “We can probably create the protection levels with cuts not as big as what she described,” Arizona’s top water official Tom Buschatzke told CNN. “I think that might help us get to the place we need to be.” After more than a year of contentious negotiations between Arizona, California and other Western states on how exactly to distribute those cuts, Buschatzke and other officials say the wet winter has taken some of the pressure off. On Tuesday, the Interior Department and Bureau of Reclamation are expected to release the first installment of an environmental analysis examining what different volumes of Colorado River cuts will look like for the cities, farmers and tribes who all depend on the water. The wet winter likely won’t be reflected in Reclamation’s analysis, according to Bill Hasencamp, the manager of Colorado River Resources for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides water to Los Angeles. “People in the upper basin are dealing with feet and feet and feet of snow. The snowpack is still increasing,” Hasencamp told CNN. “It’s a completely different trend than we’ve seen the last three years. This is definitely going to make a huge difference in the short run. But people don’t want to go too far because they don’t want to go back to complacency.” Still, others are cautioning that one historic winter will only delay the inevitable pain of water cuts, as years of overuse collide with climate change-fueled droughts. As welcome as the reprieve this winter is, if water usage isn’t cut by up to 25%, “we will crash that system,” said Cynthia Campbell, water resources management adviser for the city of Phoenix, told CNN. “I think we’re going to come right back to that conclusion in a year – in a very short amount of time.” Even with the possible short-term reprieve from this winter’s snowpack, the Biden administration is readying a flurry of Colorado River announcements as it scrambles to deal with a fast-growing crisis in the Western US. On Tuesday, the federal government’s highly anticipated analysis will compare several scenarios on the Colorado River – comparing taking no action with other water-cutting scenarios of various degrees. The Biden administration is expected to select a preferred scenario this summer. But the administration is also hoping to incentivize water cuts by paying cities, tribes and farmers to reduce water use for the next few years. Last week, administration officials announced the first deal it signed in a series of short-term agreements to fallow farmland and keep more water in Lake Mead. The Gila River Indian Community in Arizona promised to conserve 125,000 acre-feet – about 40 billion gallons – of Colorado River water for the next three years. In exchange, the federal government agreed to pay for $233 million worth of water infrastructure and conservation projects for the tribe. At a news conference at Arizona’s state capital on Thursday, Deputy Interior Secretary Tommy Beaudreau told reporters more fallowing agreements would be coming soon. “What you’re going to see in the coming months are additional announcements of deploying and awarding [federal] funding to communities throughout the basin in order to conserve water,” Beaudreau said – adding funding would also go to longer-term projects to cut water use in the West, such as water recycling and drip irrigation. “You’re going to see a steady drumbeat of that.” Federal and state officials are hoping that the short-term payments to let agricultural fields go dry could add 10 additional feet of elevation in Lake Mead – the Colorado River’s largest reservoir and the largest reservoir in the country overall. But whether 10 feet is achievable remains to be seen; many of these agreements have yet to be signed and are flexible enough to give farmers and cities the chance to back out if dry conditions return and they need the water, one source familiar with the agreements told CNN. The 25% cuts Touton called for last year spurred a tough series of state negotiations that yielded little consensus. Sticking points have included whether the senior priority rights that protect California and Arizona farmers and tribes from cuts should remain intact. Stakeholders around the basin are expecting more tough negotiations to take place in 2026, when the current guidelines that govern how the river is managed are set to expire. Many state water negotiators are breathing a sigh of relief the wet winter and short-term fallowing agreements are coinciding this year. “What we expect that means is that Lake Powell and Lake Mead will balance,” Brenda Burman, general manager of the Central Arizona Project and former Bureau of Reclamation commissioner, told CNN. “That helps with what type of shortage we might have next year, that helps as far as where we think the reservoirs might be in two to three years, so it’s very good news.” Still, Burman cautioned that since 2000, the Colorado River hasn’t seen two years of good hydrology in a row – meaning celebrations could be short-lived. “Even though this year is looking like a very good year for runoff; one, we haven’t seen it yet, and two, we don’t know what will happen next year,” Burman said. Along the Colorado River, all eyes are on the federal government’s forthcoming announcement of what different water cut scenarios could look like. In the meantime, Colorado Basin state negotiators are starting to look more toward 2026, increasingly confident the good year of winter and water will help them avoid dire cuts in the short-term. “We don’t want to be fighting over the short term and miss the real prize, which is the long term,” Hasencamp told CNN. One outside expert watching negotiations told CNN the talk about not having to make hard choices now is concerning, given how close the river has already come to crashing. “Perhaps more worrisome is the fact it buys us time,” said Sarah Porter, the director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. “We have already come very close to minimum power pool and we’re now able to say the words dead pool. We need a negotiated agreement or a federal action to get us out of this zone.”"

","Sophie Tanno, CNN","A boom in wind and solar has pushed the amount of electricity produced by renewable energy to record levels last year, according to a new analysis. The use of coal, oil and gas to produce electricity is expected to fall in 2023, according to the report, published Wednesday by energy think tank Ember. This would mark the first year to see a decline in the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity, outside of a global recession or pandemic. Levels of planet-heating pollution from fossil fuel electricity generation may have already peaked, the report found. The findings show the world has reached the “beginning of the end of the fossil age,” the lead author of the research, Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, said in a statement. “We are entering the clean power era,” she added. Ember analyzed data from 78 countries representing 93% of global demand for electricity, for the fourth edition of its annual Global Electricity Review. Nearly 40% of global electricity is now powered by renewables and nuclear energy, marking a new record high, according to the report. Wind and solar made up 12% of global energy generation in 2022, up from 10% the previous year. Solar energy was the fastest-growing source of electricity in 2022 for the 18th year in a row, rising by 24% compared to the previous year. Wind generation increased by 17%. Ember forecasts that in 2023, clean energy will be able to meet the total growth in electricity demand. Fossil fuels do still dominate, however. Coal power remained the single largest source of electricity across the globe, accounting for 36% of global electricity production in 2022. This is because overall demand for electricity rose, and not all of it was met from renewable sources, according to Wiatros-Motyka. But Ember forecasts that 2022 will come to mark a “peak” in levels of planet-heating pollution from electricity generation, and the final year of fossil power growth. The report predicts a small drop in fossil fuel generation of 0.3%, in 2023, with larger falls in subsequent years as wind and solar energy takes off. “The stage is set for wind and solar to achieve a meteoric rise to the top,” Wiatros-Motyka said. “A new era of falling fossil emissions means the coal power phase down will happen, and the end of gas power growth is now within sight. Change is coming fast. However, it all depends on the actions taken now by governments, businesses and citizens to put the world on a pathway to clean power by 2040.”"

Twin Cities, Minnesota, also broke a record after reaching a high of 88 degrees. As an area of high pressure continues to build in the region, this will allow for temperatures to continue to warm and dry conditions to prevail. “The dry airmass in place makes it quite easy to overachieve on highs and it is certainly possible that we approach 90 again in La Crosse,” the National Weather Service office in La Crosse, Wisconsin, said. If La Crosse hits 90, that would shatter their old record of 80 degrees. The heat will stretch as far as the Northeast and parts of New England, with New York City expected to top out in the mid-80s, which will come close to tying or breaking records for Thursday and Friday. Cities including Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington and even Boston could set records this week. “Most areas away from Cape Cod, the immediate south coast and the North Shore should see their first 80 degree day since Sept/Oct 2022, and it is not out of the question that the Hartford and Springfield CT Valley areas could get very close to or reach 90,” the weather service office in Boston said. Overnight lows are also staying warm, which doesn’t allow for much recovery from the heat. More than 75 record-high minimum temperatures could be set by Saturday morning. Warm temperatures, along with low humidity levels and gusty winds, will create an elevated risk of wildfires. The weather service is warning of an elevated fire risk while the record warmth and dry conditions persist. “Fine fuels in the form of dry or dead vegetation will be quite dry as well, and conducive to fire starts and fairly quick fire spread,” the weather service office in Mount Holly, New Jersey, warned. “This is particularly true in areas that have not received hardly any rainfall in the last 10 days, across much of Pennsylvania to northern and central New Jersey.” Winds could gust as high as 35 mph, which will cause any fire that forms to spread quickly. A wildfire has already broken out in New Jersey this week. The fire is now 75% contained, but it has already scorched roughly 4,000 acres and forced evacuations. CNN Meteorologist Rob Shackelford contributed to this article."

","Lauren Lee, CNN","People of color in the US face heightened risks of harm from climate-induced disasters. Now, non-profits are pushing to remedy that disparity with more equitable approaches to disaster preparedness, response and recovery. “Until we really address the root issues of climate injustice, we’re going to continue to see a disproportionate impact as it relates to disasters in Black and historically excluded communities,” said Abre’ Conner, Director of Environmental and Climate Justice for the NAACP. A report by the EPA’s Office of Atmospheric Programs looked at four vulnerable social groups: people living on low-income, racial minorities, those with no high school diploma, and seniors over age 65.  Of those four groups, the study found minorities are most likely to live in areas projected to be impacted by climate change. Moreover, Black people are 40% more likely than non-African-Americans to live in areas with the highest projected increases in mortality rates due to changes in extreme temperatures. It’s a dire warning for the future, based on an inequitable past. Many marginalized people, Black in particular, have faced socioeconomic factors that relegate them to living in environmentally hazardous areas or substandard housing structures. So, when a natural disaster hits, they are ill-equipped to withstand the impact. That was the situation this past March 24 when a severe tornado leveled much of the Black-majority  rural town of Rolling Fork, Mississippi, killing 26 people. Racial disparities existed in Rolling Fork for decades. Many residents there were poor, had low access to information or internet service, were priced out of insurance coverage, and lived in mobile homes that weren’t retrofitted to withstand severe weather conditions. With the nearest tornado shelter over 15 miles away, it set the perfect storm to leave people displaced and scrambling for aid and assistance, which was very slow to arrive. “The tendency is to ignore and exclude, and that’s a violation of human rights,” said Chauncia Willis, CEO and founder of the Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Management (I-DIEM). Willis’ group deploys equity response teams before and after disasters to help community organizations integrate equity into all facets of disaster policy and practices. She started I-DIEM after spending over 14 years in disaster management. “I’ve witnessed the disparities, and it hits a little different when the people look like you,” Willis said in an interview with CNN. Almost three weeks after the tornado, Rolling Fork’s mayor said about 500 people  – roughly a third of the town’s population— remained displaced, leaving victims with questions and concerns. To provide some answers, FEMA, MEMA (Mississippi Emergency Management Agency), the Small Business Administration, and the  American Red Cross are holding a series of town halls, the first of which took place  Tuesday at South Delta Elementary School. Housing is a major concern at the present. “It wasn’t just Rolling Fork; it was all of those other communities surrounding that were also impacted by the tornado,” said Willis. “That’s going to be the difference between life and death in the future.” The future is concerning; marginalized communities historically endured long-term effects from disasters. Remnants of destruction are still visible In New Orleans’ primarily Black 9th ward 18 years after Hurricane Katrina. Although natural disasters don’t discriminate, the response can, especially when the lingering effects of structural racism hamper relief. In Katrina’s aftermath, Louisiana instituted a “Road Home” program, disbursing emergency funds based on appraised home values rather than actual rebuilding costs. But after decades of discriminatory economic practices including redlining, homes in historically White communities typically appraised far higher than comparable houses in Black neighborhoods. Also, New Orleans’ White neighborhoods tend to sit on higher ground with less risk of flooding and easier access to jobs and resources. The circumstances after Katrina ended up forcing many Black families out of the city. “Poverty should not hinder survival from disasters. Being a person that is not White shouldn’t limit your survival,” said Willis. But there is growing awareness of the unfairness and concerted efforts to fix it.  Sally Ray from the Center for Disaster Philanthropy says racial and socioeconomic disparities are key factors guiding where her organization deploys funding. “I think we need to quit being uncomfortable talking about the intersection of climate change, racism, and disasters,” Ray told CNN. “The reality is we have long systemic racist problems across our country, and because of these things, when a disaster comes, it’s much more devastating.” A growing body of research spotlights the historical inequity in federal disaster response. One 2018 study by sociologists from Rice University and the University of Pittsburgh looked at counties that each suffered the same amount ($10 billion) in hazard damage. In those events, Black survivors’ wealth decreased by an average $27,000 while White survivors’ average wealth increased $126,000. In 2020, FEMA’s advisory council acknowledged the inequities and called for the agency to address the issue. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 13985 to advance racial equity and support for underserved communities through the federal government. Since then, FEMA has undertaken initiatives to expand access and reduce barriers to their response, recovery, and resilience programs. In an email to CNN, FEMA spokesman Jeremy Edwards said, “Recognizing this and the realities of historically underserved communities, FEMA—under the leadership of Administrator Criswell—has undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce barriers, so all people, including those from vulnerable and underserved communities, are better able to access our assistance.” The agency has simplified the eligibility process, expanded the ways survivors can verify home occupancy, and prioritized casework for vulnerable populations. FEMA says these changes have enabled 124,000 survivors to access over $709 million in assistance they would have previously been ineligible to receive. But non-profit leaders want FEMA to do more. “I think that in earnest they are trying to correct, but we can still do better in pushing to ensure these recoveries are equitable,” said Art delaCruz, CEO of Team Rubicon. This veteran-led humanitarian organization assists global communities before, during, and after disasters and crises. Grassroots activists insist equitable disaster planning and response must start with local voices. “The future of disaster management is actually going to be at the local level with the locals as the lead rather than the federal government or state government,” explained I-DEIM’s Willis. Inherent distrust of authorities after years of racist and discriminatory practices is one reason why. Another reason is simple pragmatism. “Who knows the community better?” asked Willis, whose group helps set up Community Resilience Hubs and local-led facilities to support neighbors, coordinate communication and provide emergency management training. Willis emphasizes that these types of initiatives, and more, need to be done before disasters strike. “When people are not prioritized before a disaster, those same people will bear the brunt.” For a long time, non-profit organizations have been counted on to plug gaps that the government had yet to fill in disenfranchised communities. And increasingly, non-profits are doing things differently to address racial disparities in disaster management. For Team Rubicon, that means using tools like the CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index. The index, launched by the Center for Disease Control and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, uses 16 variables to help emergency planners and officials identify vulnerable communities before, during, or after disasters. Those variables include social factors like poverty, lack of transportation, and crowded housing. The databases and maps generated by the tool help estimate supplies required, emergency personnel needs, evacuation procedures, and even whether an area needs emergency shelters. “As we see a disaster strike an area, that is where we try to deploy because we know that’s where the greatest need is,” explained delaCruz. The Center for Disaster Philanthropy focuses on identifying a diverse pool of applicants in their grantmaking, pushing more funds to organizations supporting struggling communities of color, and listening to the needs of the affected people on an individualized basis. “We work really at the local grassroots level to get to know the community,” said the Center for Disaster Philanthropy’s Sally Ray, who spoke to CNN from Oklahoma City, which was hard-hit by tornadoes last year. She and her team are on the ground, accessing lingering issues and working on proactive ways to support the town throughout this year’s tornado season. “Our goal has always been to leave a community in a better place and be there for the long-term commitment to that, Ray added. Meanwhile, many non-profits, especially at the local level, are overstretched as major disasters become more frequent and destructive. “There are communities that have suffered disaster after disaster after disaster, and the toll on the people and the community increases each time that happens,” said delaCruz. “We need to start integrating community-based organizations into the global emergency management structure,” said Willis. Disasters destabilize communities as well as economies. That is why much of the conversation among emergency management leaders lately has focused on building an inclusive approach to disaster resilience. “In Rolling Rock, there’s been a disaster. Now is the time to rebuild with the proper strategy, with forethought, a focus on resilience, and a focus on life-saving equity,” Willis from I-DIEM explained. She said these resilience efforts must include disaster preparedness and infrastructure improvement and awareness of socioeconomic issues impacting marginalized communities. FEMA says they are committed to helping Mississippi recover. To date the agency says they have visited 1,400 homes in Sharkey County alone, interacting with over 2,400 survivors and registering hundreds for assistance. They’ve also provided more than $5.4 million to Mississippi households since the deadly tornadoes struck earlier this year. The agency also implemented some grassroots efforts like non-financial direct technical assistance to help build community-wide resilience in 20 communities, tribes, and territories. Nonprofits continue to play a crucial role. But the problem looms large, and when it comes to disaster response for historically marginalized communities, there’s more than enough workload to go around. “There is no value in not directly preparing communities of color,” Willis said. “The government already underserves them. Do they also need to be underserved by humanity?”"

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","Planet-warming methane pollution from the US oil and gas industry was 70% higher than the Environmental Protection Agency’s own estimates between 2010 and 2019, scientists reported Monday. The new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the federal government’s current system for detecting methane leaks from fossil fuel pipes, wells and compressors is inadequate. Several recent studies have shown similar results, and scientists now say the EPA needs to leverage new technology to get a fuller picture of how much of this potent greenhouse gas is escaping into the atmosphere and hold companies accountable for the leaks. Methane, the main component of natural gas and a byproduct of fossil fuel drilling, has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide in the first two decades it’s in the atmosphere. The oil and gas industry is the main source of global methane emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. Levels have risen precipitously in recent years, and scientists are looking at the gas as a target to cut climate emissions quickly because it has such a powerful warming effect. While researchers used data from satellite instruments to paint a picture of methane leaks across the US, oil and gas operators and the EPA often rely on engineering models and hand-held infrared equipment to track leaks, which experts say is inadequate. “This has been known for a while, at least in the atmospheric science community,” said Daniel Jacob, one of the study’s lead authors and a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University. “When we observe methane in the air, we find concentrations much higher than one would expect from the EPA inventories.” In a statement, an EPA spokesperson noted that another recent study found that 2019 levels were on par with the agency’s estimates for that year. “The EPA continues to work through its stakeholder process to review new data from [its] Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and research studies to assess how emissions estimates can be improved,” the spokesperson said. Experts told CNN Monday’s study points to the need for the agency to adopt better monitoring practices, as technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in the last few years. New satellite instruments can monitor methane leaks with high accuracy from space, and there are emerging remote-sensing technologies that can help pinpoint leaks coming from specific locations. “There really have been transformational advances in remote sensing technology for methane over the last decade and the last three to four years,” Riley Duren, CEO at nonprofit Carbon Mapper and a University of Arizona researcher, told CNN. “That reporting program doesn’t require operators to go out and fly airplanes. It’s largely based on models and standard emissions factors.” There’s no question the EPA is monitoring methane leaks from oil and gas operations, experts said. The problem is the scale of monitoring is too small and infrequent. Existing EPA regulations require oil and gas companies to do quarterly inspections using hand-held infrared cameras and sensors to look for leaks coming from wells and equipment, and much of the rest is accounted for with engineering models. The problem is this technique tends to miss a lot of leaked methane, experts said. “A leak that goes on for some days and then gets fixed, or some operator venting gas at a particular time of day – if you’re just cruising around and trying to observe hotspots, you might miss them,” Jacob said. Jacob and other atmospheric scientists say there should be more monitoring of methane from the air, which can catch a huge plume that has gone undetected for weeks or months. But that’s not the silver bullet for the problem either, since monitoring from the air isn’t as precise and can’t drill down to locate which specific faulty equipment or well is causing a leak. This is leading to even further advancements in technology in which satellites can monitor leaks with more precision to figure out exactly where it is coming from. That technology is going to be used more starting this year, according to Duren. “We’re going to see more of that,” Duren said. “We need to get to a place where measurements are happening on a daily or hourly basis.” And the EPA is also in the process of writing new methane regulations as President Joe Biden has made cutting methane a key part of his climate agenda. Democrats’ climate law that passed last summer also included funding for a more robust methane program that, by next year, would require companies leaking methane above a certain threshold to pay a fine if they don’t fix the problem. EPA could in the future also rely more on third-party data from researchers like those at Harvard to help identify hot spots. “Detecting methane is really hard,” said Carrie Jenks, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental & Energy Law Program. “That bottom-up assessment should be better and (EPA’s) trying to make it better. Now these technologies have evolved so fast to say ‘goodness, we’re way off.’” Oil and gas companies also have a financial incentive to capture more methane; they are losing money when they allow gas that could be sold to leak into the atmosphere. Duren said that as Carbon Mapper has informed companies or state regulators about methane plumes they’ve discovered, companies have voluntarily fixed the leaks themselves. “The combination of that forward-looking mindset from operators as well as the new regulations, I’m optimistic we’re going to close the current holes in the net,” Duren said. “We need to accelerate our efforts, because we don’t have a lot of time.”"

","Taylor Ward and Helen Regan, CNN","Temperature records are being shattered in countries across Asia as a brutal April heat wave continues to grip large portions of the continent, with little relief in sight. In Southeast Asia, some countries posted their highest ever recorded temperatures this week, while searing heat in the Indian subcontinent has killed more than a dozen people. Laos is the latest country to set a new all-time record as Luang Prabang reached 42.7°C (109°F) Tuesday, according to weather historian Maximiliano Herrera. Over the weekend, Thailand topped 45°C (113°F) for the first time in its history, according to Herrera, using data from the Thai Meteorological Department. The northwest city of Tak reached 45.4°C Saturday, but large portions of the country have been in the upper 30s to low 40s since late March. Earlier this month, Thai authorities issued a health alert for several provinces as the heat index was forecast to reach 50.2°C in the Bang Na district of the capital Bangkok. The heat index is what the temperature “feels like” and considers both air temperature and humidity to measure its impact. On Tuesday, Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed concern over “dangerously high temperatures in various parts of Thailand” and said in Bangkok’s Bang Na area, temperatures “could reach 52.3°C,” according to a statement from the prime ministers office. Neighboring Myanmar set an April temperature record on Monday as Kalewa, in central Sagaing region, reached 44°C (111°F), Herrera tweeted. April and May are typically the hottest months of the year for South and Southeast Asia as temperatures rise before monsoon rains begin and bring some relief. But the heat in Thailand has been compounded by an intense smoggy season that has caused pollution levels to spike. The tourist hotspot of Chiang Mai in the north ranked as the world’s most polluted city for seven straight days as smoke from forest fires and widespread crop burning deteriorated the air quality. At least one hospital in the city said it had reached “full ward capacity” as patients sought medical treatment for respiratory issues. The scorching temperatures have also been widespread across China. On Tuesday, the country saw temperatures as high as 42.4°C (108°F) in Yuanyang, in the southeast – only 0.3°C from the country-wide record for April, according to Herrera. On Monday, more than 100 weather stations in 12 provinces broke their April temperature record, according to climatologist Jim Yang. Although not record-breaking in most cases, the heat has also been prevalent – and deadly – across South Asia. Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh have all seen temperatures topping 40°C (104°F) for many days. According to India’s Meteorological Department, 48 weather stations recorded temperatures over 42°C on Tuesday, with the highest at 44.2°C in the eastern state of Odisha. In western Maharashtra state, at least 13 people died from heatstroke after attending a state award ceremony on Sunday. More than 1 million people attended the event in Navi Mumbai and between 50 to 60 people were hospitalized, according to a city police official. Meanwhile, at least two states, Tripura in the northeast and West Bengal in the east, ordered schools to shut this week, as temperatures rose more than 5 degrees Celsius above normal, state governments said, Reuters reported. The Indian Ministry of Labor issued an advisory to all states and regions to ensure the safety of workers – especially outdoor laborers and miners – in the extreme heat. That includes providing adequate drinking water, emergency ice packs, and frequent rest breaks. Heat waves in India usually take place between March and July, but in recent years these hot spells have become more intense, more frequent and longer. Last year, India experienced a searing heatwave, where parts of the country reached more than 49°C (120°F). As the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis accelerate and global temperatures continue to rise, scientists say heat waves will only become more common. A 2022 study found that dangerous heat waves will be between three and 10 times more often by the turn of the century. In the tropics, which encompasses much of Asia, people could be exposed to dangerous heat most days of the year, the study found. Days of “extremely dangerous heat” – which is defined as 51°C (124°F) – could double and experts say those levels of heat push the limits of human survivability. Extremely hot temperatures across South and Southeast Asia are expected to continue. Meanwhile, cooler conditions are on the way for much of China as temperatures are forecast to fall from around 10°C (18°F) above average to 10°C (18° F) below average this weekend. CNN’s Kocha Olarn contributed from Thailand and Manveena Suri from New Delhi."

People of color are disproportionately affected, as are residents of Western cities. Since President Richard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act in 1970, emissions of outdoor air pollutants have fallen 78%, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. But Wednesday’s 2023 State of the Air report, which focuses on ozone and particle pollution, shows that millions put their health on the line every time they step outside. To capture pollution levels at the county level, researchers analyzed data collected by the EPA’s Air Quality System, a repository of ambient air quality data from more than 10,000 monitors. They characterized the hourly average ozone concentration and the 24-hour average particle pollution concentration for 2019-21 at each monitoring site and factored in year-round pollution information from the EPA. There were significant improvements in some areas. Generally, 17.6 million fewer people were breathing unhealthy air than in last year’s report, due largely to falling levels of ozone in some regions. Ozone pollution is the main ingredient in smog. It comes from cars, power plants and refineries. Exposure to ozone can immediately exacerbate asthma symptoms, and people with long-term exposure to higher levels face a significantly higher risk of death from respiratory diseases than those who live with cleaner air. Around 25% more counties got an A grade in the report for lower levels of ozone pollution. Some of that improvement can be attributed to the Clean Air Act, according to Katherine Pruitt, author of the report and the American Lung Association’s national senior director for policy. Emission controls have helped, she said, as has the country’s continuing move away from its reliance on coal for its energy needs. Even something simple as the increase in the number of people who work from home has played a role. “The Biden administration has set themselves a good, strong to do list of things that will help with environmental justice and climate protection,” Pruitt said. “They’re moving kind of slow, though. So we’d like them to pick up the pace.” Despite the progress, not everyone was lucky enough to live in a county with good ozone levels. More than 100 million people live in counties that get an F for ozone smog, the report says. Western and Southwestern cities are the most ozone-polluted, with 10 of the 25 most-polluted cities in California. New York, Chicago and Hartford, Connecticut, were the only three on that list east of the Mississippi River. The five metropolitan areas with the worst ozone pollution are Los Angeles-Long Beach, California; Visalia, California; Bakersfield, California; Fresno-Madera-Hanford, California; and Phoenix-Mesa, Arizona. Particle pollution, the other form of pollution tracked in the report, still seems to be a significant issue for the US. Often hard to see, particle pollution is a mix of solid and liquid droplets that may come in the form of dirt, dust, soot or smoke. Coal- and natural gas-fired power plants create it, as do cars, agriculture, unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfires. Particle pollution is so tiny – 1/20th of a width of a human hair – that it can travel past your body’s usual defenses. Instead of being carried out when you exhale, it can get stuck in your lungs or go into your bloodstream. The particles cause irritation and inflammation and may lead to respiratory problems. Exposure can cause cancer, stroke or heart attack; it could also aggravate asthma, and it has even been associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety, studies show. The new report says the number of people living in counties with failing grades for daily spikes of particle pollution was the highest it has been in a decade. Nearly 64 million live with these kind of unhealthy spikes in counties that get failing grades. One driver of the high amounts of particle pollution are the wildfires that have consumed hundreds of thousands of acres. In 2021 alone, there were 14,407 fires, many in the West, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. There used to be a wildfire season, experts say, but now they happen year-round. Those fires are why the regions with the highest concentrations of air pollution are largely in the West. When the American Lung Association started producing its report in 2004, 106 counties in 30 states got failing grades for daily spikes in particle pollution. Fewer than half were in eight states west of the Rocky Mountains. Today, 111 counties in 19 states got Fs for spikes in particle pollution, and all but eight counties are in the West, the report says. Urban centers in the Rust Belt and the industrialized East had gotten the most failing grades in the early 2000s, but many have cleaned up and now get passing grades. Bakersfield, California, displaced Fresno as the metropolitan area with the worst short-term particle pollution, but Fresno did not suddenly develop cleaner air. That city still had the most-polluted label for year-round particle pollution, tied with Visalia, in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley. Los Angeles is still the city with the worst ozone pollution, according to the report, as it has been for all but one of the years included in the report. California has some of the more progressive environmental legislation in the country, but the climate crisis has not been kind to the state, said Tarik Benmarhnia, an air pollution and wildfire researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who did not work on the new report. “All these cities like Bakersfield and Visalia are in a valley near the forests that are seeing big fires. There’s also intense agricultural and industrial work there, so they unfortunately have all the worst conditions for air pollution,” Benmarhnia said. There are some newcomers to the list of the 25 areas with the most particle pollution, including Denver and Fargo, North Dakota. Reno, Nevada; Yakima and Spokane, Washington; and Boise, Idaho; all made the worst list this year. San Luis Obispo, California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle and Bellingham, Washington; all moved off the list of worst 25 cities. Residents in the cities ranked worst for particle pollution are living with more of it, the report says. In the top 25 cities with the worst air, the average number of days residents were exposed to high levels of fine particle pollution increased to a weighted average of 18.3, up from 16.5 in last year’s report. East of the Mississippi, Pittsburgh and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, were the two worst metropolitan areas in the country, posting more days high in fine particle pollution in this year’s report. Not everyone experiences pollution the same way in the US. Regardless of the region, communities of color bear the brunt of the problem. Specifically, although people of color make up 41% of the overall US population, they are 54% of the nearly 120 million people living in counties with at least one failing grade for unhealthy air. And in the counties with the worst air quality, 72% of the 18 million residents are people of color, the report said. Other research has also shown this trend. On maps that lay out areas with high levels of air pollution and where communities were redlined – areas where Black people were forced to live – they line up perfectly, Pruitt said. “Then, the other aspect is, when you have a community of color that is a voluntary community, people aren’t forced to live there, those are communities that tend to have less of a voice, so decision makers place polluting sources in those communities because there’s not as much howling by people with power when they do. So those communities get the highways; they get the landfills; they get the fence lines,” she said. There’s a myth that only poor communities live with disproportionate pollution levels, says Chris Tessum, a professor in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department of the University of Illinois. Tessum, who was not involved in the new report, says race really is the determining factor. “The thinking is that people with more money will buy better property, which has lower air pollution and that’s just the way of the world or whatever, but that’s just kind of emphatically not, not true,” he said. Communities need to play a key role in making decisions to help clean air, Tessum said. “People that have the power will use that power to benefit themselves and not the people that have been historically overburdened,” he said. The new report says government and residents can make a difference. One suggestion is to leverage Inflation Reduction Act funding to help reduce emissions at ports and to invest in zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles and in infrastructure that would improve air quality monitoring. States can also use the Clean Air Act authority to adopt the California zero-emissions standards for cars and trucks, the report says. At the federal level, agencies must finalize stronger limits on air pollution to truly protect public health and advance environmental justice, the report says, including standards to move the country toward zero-emissions vehicles. The EPA also has to set stronger national standards for particle pollution and ozone, the researchers say. Pruitt said she knows firsthand how better policies can work. She said growing up before the Clean Air Act, pollution was so high that she could see it every time she stepped outside. Today, the pollution is not nearly as visible. “I’m in my mid-60s, and of course, air pollution was very tangible when I was young, but these days, thank goodness it isn’t. Most people don’t see it,” she said. Unless a person has a lung condition, they may not even feel it. But just because you can’t see it or feel it doesn’t mean it’s not there. Pruitt encourages people to remember that no level of pollution is safe. The World Health Organization estimates that the combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated with 6.7 million premature deaths annually. “People don’t really recognize that what they’re breathing is impacting their health,” Pruitt said."

","Helen Regan, CNN","Deadly heat waves fueled by climate change are threatening India’s development and risk reversing its progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth, a new study has found. Heat waves have already critically impacted the country, leading to power outages, increased dust and air pollution, and accelerated glacial melt in the north of India, researchers from the University of Cambridge said in the study published in the journal PLOS Climate on Wednesday. Since 1992, more than 24,000 people have died because of heat waves in India, the study said. And the impacts are expected to get worse as heat waves become more frequent, intense and lethal due to the climate crisis. “India is currently facing a collision of multiple cumulative climate hazards,” said the researchers. “Long-term projections indicate that Indian heat waves could cross the survivability limit for a healthy human resting in the shade by 2050.” The study shows that millions more people in India are vulnerable to climate change than first thought. More than 90% of the country could be severely impacted by heat waves, falling into an extreme heat “danger” zone, according to the heat index, the study found. The heat index is how hot it feels and considers both air temperature and humidity to assess the heat’s impact on the population. Last year, India experienced a searing heat wave, during which parts of the country reached more than 49°C (120°F). In 2022, India experienced its hottest April in 122 years and its hottest March on record, the study said. And it experienced extreme weather on 242 out of 273 days between January and October 2022, the researchers found. Such repeated heat stress will upend millions of lives and livelihoods. “Estimates show a 15% decrease in outdoor working capacity … during daylight hours due to extreme heat by 2050,” the study found. “The increased heat is expected to cost India 2.8% and 8.7% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and depressed living standards by 2050 and 2100, respectively.” By mid-century, 70 Indian cities are expected to have more than 1 million inhabitants, according to the study. Extreme heat will pose a threat to the energy security and health of those people, and reverse progress in inequality and poverty reduction, the researchers found. “My family in Kolkata is suffering from current heat waves leading to frequent load shedding,” said the author of the study, Dr Ramit Debnath, in a reference to enforced power outages that reduce strain on the grid. “The climate-energy nexus is becoming more relevant,” he added. Typically, it’s the poorest and most vulnerable who will suffer the most. Heat waves will “have unprecedented consequences on the low-income population” the study said. As an example, the authors point to the rapidly urbanizing capital New Delhi, which “has a high level of construction activities, mostly involving a low-income labor force, who are also at severe risk from heat wave impacts.” While India has a “climate vulnerability index” through which it assesses its vulnerability to the climate crisis, the authors believe this underestimates how heat waves impact the country’s development. India has committed to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, a list of 17 objectives that include cutting poverty, hunger, inequality and disease, as well as promoting health, education and sanitation. By not understanding the true threat of heat waves on its population, India risks missing out on those goals. The study’s co-author Professor Ronita Bardhan said the recommendations could be used to build heat resilience for low-income housing as “these communities are most vulnerable to heat impacts.” “Heat-health packages for low-income and slum dwellers are specifically critical as we show heat waves have devastating impacts on urban sustainability,” she said. Another practical application is urban greening strategies around highly dense areas, which “can provide relief from urban heat island effects,” Bardhan said. The authors stress “urgency” in recommending India update its extreme weather assessment to include the heat index and its impact on India’s sustainable development. “India has demonstrated tremendous leadership in scaling up heat action plans in the last five years by declaring heat waves a natural disaster and mobilizing appropriate relief resources,” the authors said. But “as the heat waves in India and the Indian subcontinent become recurrent and long-lasting, it is high time that climate experts and policymakers reevaluate the metrics for assessing the country’s climate vulnerability.”"

","Jack Guy, CNN","The Earth’s ice sheets lost enough ice over the last 30 years to create an ice cube 12 miles high, according to new research. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which hold almost all of the world’s freshwater ice, are shrinking at a frighteningly rapid pace, according to a report on Thursday from a team of international scientists. Combining data from 50 satellite surveys of Antarctica and Greenland, spanning the years 1992 to 2020, scientists from the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise, or IMBIE, were able to track changes in the ice sheets’ volume and ice flow. They found that ice sheet melting has increased six-fold over the past 30 years, as record levels of planet-heating pollution push up global temperatures. The seven worst years for polar ice sheet melting all happened during the past decade. In all, the polar ice sheets lost more than 8.3 trillion tons of ice between 1992 and 2020, according to the report. The worst year for ice sheet loss was 2019, the report found, when the ice sheets lost around 675 billion tons of ice. These losses were driven by an Arctic heatwave, which saw Greenland’s ice sheet shed 489 billion tons. The loss of ice is having a significant impact on the oceans, pushing up sea levels by 21 millimeters (just less than an inch), according to the report. Ice sheet melting now accounts for a quarter of all sea level rise – a fivefold increase since the 1990s. “This is a huge amount of ice,” study lead author Inès Otosaka, a research fellow at the University of Leeds, told CNN. “This is very worrying, of course, because 40% of the global population lives in coastal areas,” she said. Scientists found that the rate at which the Antarctic ice sheet is melting has slowed, but remains much faster than in the 1990s. The report identified the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica  – the location of the troubled Thwaites Glacier, nicknamed the “Doomsday” glacier for its potentially devastating impact on sea level rise  – as the regions where most of the continent’s melt was happening. Otosaka expects the Greenland ice sheet to continue losing ice, but said it’s not yet clear what might happen to the Antarctic ice sheet. “In Antarctica we have higher uncertainty in the future,” she said.”We have what we call some low-probability but high-impact mechanisms that could be triggered if we exceed a certain level of warming.” That could lead to a much higher sea level rise in the future, she added. If the world hits certain warming thresholds, it could trigger important and potentially irreversible feedback mechanisms, Otosaka said. “We really need to have strong governmental policies to limit future warming and to cut our greenhouse gas concentration,” she added. The European Space Agency, which along with NASA helps fund IMBIE’s research, said in a statement: “It is without doubt that climate change is causing our polar ice sheets to melt, thereby driving up sea levels and putting coastal regions around the world at risk.” Scientists at IMBIE plan to update the assessment every year. “We are finally at the stage where we can continuously update our assessments of ice sheet mass balance as there are enough satellites in space monitoring them, which means that people can make use of our findings immediately,” Andrew Shepherd, a professor at Northumbria University and founder of IMBIE, said in a statement."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","The Biden administration is planning to roll out aggressive new rules to regulate planet-warming pollution from natural gas power plants, three sources familiar with the plan and who have been briefed on the rules told CNN, in a move that could face fierce legal challenges. President Joe Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency has been exploring ways to tighten the rules for not just new power plants that will run on natural gas, but existing plants too, the sources said. According to the sources, the rules would be more stringent than previously planned regulations, which aimed to control pollution from new natural gas power plants and would have effectively grandfathered existing plants into older rules. The EPA’s new strategy on power plants has gained traction in the administration in the past few weeks, one source said, amid intense pressure from environmental groups. The Biden administration frustrated those groups – and young, climate-minded voters – when it approved the controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska in March. Since then, the administration has put forward an ambitious vehicle tailpipe rule that could revolutionize the car market in the US and see electric vehicles making up two-thirds of new car sales by 2032. Importantly for the forthcoming power plant regulations, the electricity sector generates a quarter of all planet-warming pollution in the US, according to the EPA, and slashing that pollution quickly is key for the country to achieve net-zero climate emissions by 2050, as Biden has pledged to do. The EPA did not comment on the details of the plan, noting that they were still under review. But EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll told CNN that the agency is “moving urgently to advance standards that protect people and the planet, building on the momentum from President Biden’s Investing in America economic agenda, including proposals to address carbon emissions from new and existing power plants.” “Once the interagency review process is completed, EPA looks forward to sharing more information with stakeholders and the public,” Carroll said. A source familiar with the plan said the rules show the EPA and Biden administration “appear to have fully learned the lessons of the Clean Power Plan.” During the Obama administration, the EPA put forward a broad-reaching power-plant rule that the US Supreme Court later threw out. The Biden administration is now trying to balance strengthening the country’s pollution standards with regulations that can stand up to further legal challenges from Republican-led states and the fossil fuel industry. “This is not an exercise in policy creativity, as much as climate advocates would like them to be,” the source said. “That’s not what these rules are going to be.” Massive amounts of funding for clean energy in the Inflation Reduction Act was a factor that helped push the administration toward the stronger rules. But it could spur concerns around the reliability of the electrical grid – especially as the Biden administration and automobile makers move aggressively toward electric vehicles. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who represents coal-heavy West Virginia and who was the one of the lead authors of the Inflation Reduction Act, has voiced concerns about retiring coal-fired power plants. The rules, which could be announced as early as Thursday, are among the most highly watched forthcoming actions from the EPA, after the Supreme Court curbed the agency’s ability to regulate emissions from power plants last year. The Supreme Court ruling said the EPA does have some authority to regulate planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions, but it limited the ways the agency could do so, saying it has the authority to regulate power plants’ activities inside their fence lines – with things such as carbon-capture systems – but couldn’t force them to transition to cleaner sources of energy. However, rules enforcing things such as carbon capture could ultimately encourage power plants to transition to renewable energy like wind and solar. Carbon capture technology is still quite expensive, and some utilities have chosen to shut down older, coal-fired power plants rather than outfitting them with the pricey equipment. Still, the EPA rules on existing and new natural gas plants are significant, since many utilities that are shutting down their coal plants are replacing them with natural gas. It is not yet clear whether the EPA will propose outfitting natural gas plants with carbon capture or similar, pollution-reducing technology."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Droughts, floods and record low ice levels – from the top of the world’s mountains to the depths of the ocean, the climate crisis took a heavy toll as it continued to intensify in 2022, new analysis from the World Meteorological Organization shows. The WMO’s annual State of the Climate Report, published Friday ahead of Earth Day, is essentially a health checkup for the world. It analyzes a series of global climate indicators – including levels of planet-heating pollution, sea level rise and ocean heat – to understand how the planet is responding to climate change and the impact it is having on people and nature. The findings paint a stark picture. “2022 was a year of extremes for the planet – and this continues the trend set in previous years,” Omar Baddour, head of the Climate Monitoring and Policy Division at the WMO, told CNN. A slew of climate records were broken, many of which have been, or are on course to be, broken again this year: These broad climate indicators are an important reflection of the state of the planet, the report noted, but extreme weather events – fueled by climate change – are where the immediate effects are most felt. “While greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and the climate continues to change, populations worldwide continue to be gravely impacted by extreme weather and climate events,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. Last year, climate change-fueled extreme weather “affected tens of millions, drove food insecurity, boosted mass migration, and cost billions of dollars in loss and damage,” he said. In 2022, China had its most extensive and long-lasting drought on record. Droughts also affected East Africa, with more than 20 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia facing acute food insecurity as of January this year. Many western and southern US states experienced significant drought and Europe’s punishing heatwave is estimated to have led to 15,000 excess deaths. In Pakistan, record-breaking rainfall left huge swaths of the country underwater, killing more than 1,700 people, with almost 8 million displaced, and causing $30 billion in damages. The most vulnerable are the hardest hit, Baddour said. “Communities and countries which have contributed least to climate change suffer disproportionately.” Last year is unlikely to be an outlier, as temperatures continue their upwards trajectory. The past eight years were the hottest on record, despite three consecutive years of the La Niña climate phenomenon, which has a global cooling effect. The global average temperature last year climbed to about 1.15 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to the report, as the world continues its march towards breaching 1.5 degrees of warming for the first time. With the predicted arrival later in the year of El Niño, which brings warmer global temperatures, scientists are deeply concerned that 2023 and 2024 will continue to smash climate records. The hottest year on record, 2016, was the result of a strong El Niño and climate change, said Baddour. “It is only a matter of time before that record is broken.” The WMO report follows an analysis published Thursday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which focused on how climate change affected Europe last year. It highlighted “alarming” changes to the continent’s climate, including the hottest summer ever recorded, unprecedented marine heatwaves in the Mediterranean sea and widespread wildfires. “The droughts and level of heatwaves that we saw throughout 2022 were quite remarkable,” Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, told CNN. “This is really a wake up call that climate change isn’t a future problem, it is a current problem. And we need to adapt as quickly as possible,” she added."

Watch Weir investigate “How to Unscrew a Planet,” on CNN’s “The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper,” Sunday at 8 p.m. ET. Dear River, You’ve only been around for three Earth Days, but your tiny lifetime has been a hell of a ride, kid. As a member of Generation Alpha (Good name! Hopeful.) I like to think you’ll read these letters with intent as you turn 30 in 2050. By then, you’ll know what became of the American experiment in the Age of Unreason and how fast the weather became unrecognizable. Since your last birthday, I watched the most expensive storm in Florida history upend lives down to the littlest, while out West, the hydrology has gone bonkers, with not enough water here and too much over there and no real plan on how to divvy it up among people who want lawns in the desert. While the American electricity made by clean sources surpassed coal-fired power for the first time, a Russian-led ground war in Europe set up a world where Saudi oil company Aramco made the second-highest annual profit in the history of humanity, just behind (checks notes) Saudi Aramco. If that’s not enough to make a new Old Dad stare in the middle distance, the nation of your birth has also been torn apart by $787,500,000 worth of lies without apology and conspiracy theories around every corner. The leading cause of childhood death is now a bullet – or usually several at once – and some nights, the only thought that brings me peace is that you are half-Canadian. But one thing I’ve learned as the first Chief Climate Correspondent on American television, when your beat is a “hyperobject” – a phenomenon so vast it exceeds human comprehension – one of the upsides is that you can choose to squint at it from an infinite number of angles on any given day. I spent the first couple years on this beat obsessing over the dark side of the human triptych in our real-life version of “The Garden of Earthly Delights,” while occasionally sneering at all the freaky human decadence causing our downfall in the middle – what Hieronymus Bosch called “Humankind Before the Flood.” But my mental health improved when I decided to spend more time between disasters over in the panel of goodness and light. One wild penguin colony or sustainable neighborhood at a time, I’m trying to balance out the firehose of peer-reviewed dread by focusing less on Life As We Blew It and more on Life As We Know It Could Be. Every week, I get pitched a world with airships hauling clean fuel instead of diesel tractor trailers, and sting ray-shaped robots that sink seaweed to bury carbon instead of factory-fishing trawlers that clear-cut the sea. Your buses could bring you to school on sunlight and then help power your classrooms after dark. The world’s most abundant fuel source might be hydrogen made from sun and sea water, or little nuclear fusion stars in boxes filling batteries made of salt or minerals mined on the Asteroid Psyche. All this utopian stuff is technically feasible but, as I learned filming “How To Unscrew A Planet” for CNN’s “The Whole Story,” they must also be scalable, affordable and profitable, which means our fates will be decided as much by marketers and influencers as policy makers and engineers. In a balloon over the Alps, legendary aeronaut Bertrand Piccard described how he found over 1,400 money-making, Earth-healing start-ups and tried to convince me that the answers are all around us, if only we can think like a balloonist and “change our altitude and attitude” by dropping the ballast of wasteful ideas and dirty fuels. But we still need dirty fuels to build all this new stuff and in your third year on Earth, we were just starting to wrap our heads around the trillion-ton problem of moving generations-worth of excess carbon out of sea and sky and back into the rock and seabed where it came from. “We have to build the oil industry in reverse!” Marty Odlin told me, sitting on a bucket on a dock in Maine as the fisherman/scientist gave me my metaphor for a show about planet-cooking CO2. “It’s a Godzilla,” he said. “It’s burning forests down. It’s stealing our fish. It’s devastating our crops. It’s hurting our farmers. All the stuff that’s free and fun is getting ruined. We should get mad and go kill that thing. Right?” Marty just wanted to be a fisherman growing up, but when he realized that the Gulf of Maine was too warm and acidic for his sons to ever consider the same, he started an ocean repair company to go hunting for Carbon Godzilla. Running Tide, which uses the natural carbon-sucking power of oysters and kelp, is among the finalists for the $100 million Carbon XPRIZE, funded by Elon Musk. Back when there were just a few Teslas on the road, I went to interview Musk in his modest garage headquarters on a side street in San Carlos, California, and I still remember the snap in my neck the first time I punched the Roadster’s pedal. But who could have known this guy would go on to launch his car into space for the LOLs, supplant GM and Toyota in profits and cause reputable news organizations to flee Twitter? Fifteen years later, I went back to that San Carlos street, and next door to Tesla’s old garage I met the founders of Ebb Carbon, another startup in the running for Musk’s $100 million Carbon XPRIZE. Their Model A is a machine that fixes the chemistry of water coming out of desalination plants, making the ocean less acidic while accelerating its ability to lock away carbon as bicarbonate. “That form of storage is stable for 10,000 years in the ocean,” Ebb’s CTO Matthew Eisamen told me. “And that’s a big reason for why we’re taking this approach is that’s basically the natural way the Earth regulates CO2.” They say their machine can capture 100 tons of Carbon Godzilla a year, at a current cost of over $1,000 a ton. “We need to get to billions of tons per year,” Eisamen said. “And we anticipate that this will, at scale, be one of the lowest cost approaches, much less than the magic $100 per ton.” But while Ebb just received $20 million in fresh investments, they are metaphorical toddlers at the starting line of a race to build a trillion dollar decarbonization industry in less time than it takes for an ice shelf collapse. And even if they somehow reach Tesla-like growth, science warns that the world will need hundreds of Ebbs to flourish in your lifetime to beat Carbon Godzilla. Which is why, in your third year on Earth, more people began talking in earnest about figuring out a way to turn down the sun. “We call it climate intervention,” Kelly Wanser told me as we sat under bluebird skies and the Washington Monument. Other people call it solar radiation management or geoengineering, and while the very idea touched off a fierce scientific debate, she left life as a systems expert in Silicon Valley to convince lawmakers and CEOs that humanity may be forced to mimic the cooling power of a volcano, so we should probably start studying the stratosphere now, just in case. Ever since the ash of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption blew into the stratosphere and cooled the planet by half a degree Celsius for more than a year, scientists have wondered if the effect could be duplicated by aircraft spraying enough sulfur dioxide or dust made of chalk or even diamonds to cool the Earth by a degree or two. At the University of Washington, they are trying to come up with an asthma inhaler the size of an airplane to mist seawater over land and sea to advance the field of marine cloud brightening. If properly scaled, the thinking goes that you could cool the Gulf of Mexico before hurricane season, or shade the Great Barrier Reef long enough to grow stronger coral. In the United Arab Emirates, they are even using drone-borne lasers to bring rain to the desert. But the reality is that we have no idea what works in the stratosphere, because we understand so little about the part of the sky twice as high up as our flights to Grandma’s. Chinese spy balloon scandals don’t help. “A lot more has been invested in the technology for helping determine like what shoes you want to buy than what the climate system is going to do,” Wanser said. In February, NOAA launched their first SABRE mission and sent pilots in space suits up to 60,000 feet above Alaska to take the first measurements of the stratosphere in decades. Their new tools will be a rare first glimpse into how the debris from wildfires, volcanoes and rocket exhaust is slowing, speeding or masking the rate of global warming. River, your great grandparents were alive from the Wright Brothers to the Space Shuttle, but as the Earth unravels and artificial intelligence rises faster than our imaginations, their 20th century rate of changes-per-lifetime will seem as quaint as the butter churn. So far, it feels like your future will be marked in new stories to frame our wants and needs, and new tools to build Life As We Know It Could Be. How it goes will depend on the wisdom and intent of the people wielding them, and how fast we grow or shrink Carbon Godzilla. Does this fill your Old Man with more wonder or worry? Depends on the day."

View more opinion on CNN. Last week, Germany closed its last three nuclear power plants, becoming nuclear free for the first time in 62 years. While such decisions are rightfully the responsibility of the government and electorate in Germany, it seems to be a premature choice for a world facing a changing climate, driven by humanity’s ravenous consumption of carbon-based fossil fuels. And Germany is not alone. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, many countries began phasing out nuclear power plants, citing issues of nuclear safety and long-term storage of nuclear waste. While these are valid concerns, let’s take a high-level look at energy and the potential role of nuclear power generation. In any conversation about power, we must admit a few things. First is that our technological society requires power to thrive and the need for power is constantly growing. A second consideration is that power generated by burning fossil fuels is indelibly harming our environment. Carbon dioxide released from fossil fuels are heating the planet, with substantial ecological and geopolitical consequences. Taken together, these two facts suggest that humanity needs to find increasing sources of energy which emit a minimum amount of carbon. In 1980, the annual worldwide energy production amounted to about 88,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) and it grew to 176,000 TWh in 2021, doubling in four decades. During those 40 years, the sources of energy have changed only modestly. Fossil fuels supplied 80% of the world’s energy in 1980. In 2021, it was 77%. Nuclear power grew from 2% to 4%. The remainder was generated using traditional biomass and renewable energy, like solar, wind, geothermal and hydropower. The story is not the same worldwide. For example, in Germany a substantial investment in renewables is showing significant returns. When one compares the 1990 annual German power generation to 2022, one sees a modest increase in energy usage: 550 TWh (1990) vs. 570 TWh (2022). However, the sources of energy have changed dramatically. If one compares the 1990 to 2022 percentages, one finds fossil (64% vs. 46%), nuclear (29% vs. 6%) and renewables (6% vs. 44%). The balance is from other sources. Thus, we see that Germany is making significant strides towards a green future. The country is to be congratulated for taking the danger of climate change seriously. However, we see that even as proactive a country as Germany still gets nearly half of their energy from fossil fuels, with nearly half of that carbon-based energy from burning lignite, a particularly inefficient form of fuel. While all fossil fuels release carbon dioxide when burned, when lignite is burned, it releases more carbon dioxide to get the same amount of energy than other fossil fuels do. And even if they hit their goal of 80% of their energy generated by renewables by 2030, that still leaves 20% using fossil fuels. Would not generating that power from carbon-free nuclear power plants be preferable? Opponents of nuclear energy cite safety concerns and cost. By some measures, nuclear power is more expensive than other sources. However, cost comparisons can be tricky. Costs include more than the fuel and staff needed to generate energy. It includes costs to build the power plants and, in the case of carbon-based fuels, it should include the hidden cost of damages from increasingly violent storms caused by a heating planet. In the US, the regulatory process involved in building a nuclear power plant is slow and obstructive. An American plant can take a decade or more to build, while a similar plant in Japan can take five years from starting construction to attaching the plant on the grid. The difference is mostly because of the much longer regulatory review in the US. This is made worse by the fact that American plants often differ from one another. Streamlining the process and adopting a common reactor design can shave construction costs. And, of course, nuclear power plants emit no carbon dioxide and even the carbon emissions necessary to mine the fuel are relatively modest. Solar and wind power are excellent prospects for the future, and we should vigorously pursue them. However, the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow. These green technologies require energy storage for a rainy day – literally. Nuclear power plants can run day and night, on breezy days and calm ones. Nuclear power generation is not a panacea. It does come with risks. We need to solve the problem of storing nuclear waste. The Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada was a good option, but public outcry shut down the project. Experts agree that the best choice for storing nuclear waste is in an underground facility that is “geologically stable,” which means one not prone to earthquakes or change of any kind. The most radioactive waste decays quickly, although some decay more slowly. The threat is substantially reduced in 100 years, and even more so in 1,000. The Yucca Mountain repository was designed to last even longer. America needs such a facility, and the government and nuclear industry should resume search for a suitable location to store the admittedly hazardous waste that is a byproduct of nuclear power generation. In addition, modern nuclear power plant designs generate less waste than earlier designs and further improvements should be pursued. The one thing we know about humanity is that it will continue to grow, with an associated need for energy. Nuclear power generation should be an important component of humanity’s energy future."

He is entitled to his opinion. But he has repeatedly defended that opinion by citing imaginary statistics on the extent to which sea levels are expected to rise in the future. In a Fox interview this month, Trump echoed a claim he made in his campaign launch speech in November. He said on Fox: “When I listen to people talk about global warming, that the ocean will rise, in the next 300 years, by 1/8th of an inch – and they talk about, ‘This is our problem.’ Our big problem is nuclear warming, but nobody even talks about it. The environmentalists talk about all this nonsense.” In a podcast interview that aired last week, Trump used a figure even smaller than 1/8th of an inch over 300 years: “When I see these people talking about global warming, where the ocean will rise by 1/100th of an inch over the next 350 years…” Facts First: Trump’s claims about sea levels are not remotely close to accurate. As the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has noted, the global sea level is currently rising at about 1/8th of an inch per year. In other words, the sea level rise Trump claimed people say will happen over 300 years is actually happening annually. NOAA says that, along the United States coastline in particular, sea level rise is expected to average a total of 10 to 12 inches between 2020 and 2050 alone. That means NOAA expects an average increase in the US sea level that is 80 to 96 times bigger, over just 30 years, than the “1/8th of an inch” increase Trump suggested has been projected over 300 years. And NOAA’s estimate for US sea level rise over those 30 years is 1,000 to 1,200 times bigger than the “1/100th of an inch” figure Trump cited on the podcast last week for the next 350 years. Gary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary sciences who studies sea level rise, said in an email on Friday that Trump’s claims “can only be described as totally out of touch with reality…simply untrue.” He said Trump “has no idea what he is talking about.” Sea levels rise by different amounts in different locations. For the US, sea levels are expected to rise particularly fast for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast – and Florida, which is bordered by both coasts, is expected to be affected more severely than many other coastal states. Trump’s claims about sea levels are highly inaccurate for his own home in Florida, the Mar-a-Lago resort on the Atlantic. Even in an optimistic scenario where global warming is limited to 2 degrees Celsius, the sea level near Mar-a-Lago is expected to rise nearly 3 feet by 2150 relative to 1995-2014 levels, according to a NASA projection tool that incorporates the latest climate science. That’s a projected increase of more than 3,500 times Trump’s “1/100th of an inch” figure, and in about half the time period – roughly 150 years versus Trump’s 300 years. Sea levels could rise much faster with more warming. Under a scenario with high emissions and a rapid collapse of ice sheets, NOAA says the contiguous US could see a sea level increase of 7.2 feet over 2000 levels by 2100 and an increase of 13 feet over 2000 levels by 2150. Trump has for years dishonestly dismissed the existence and impact of climate change. In a speech at a conservative conference last year, after saying that “the oceans may rise, over the next 300 years, 1/100th of an inch,” he joked, “Giving you slightly more seafront property.” In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland – rendering some communities uninhabitable and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of flooding, making hurricanes more destructive, and damaging infrastructure and ecosystems."

A huge spring chill will impact a large chunk of the country this week as well as increased flooding and ...","Jennifer Gray, CNN Meteorologist","Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. If you follow seasons by the meteorological calendar, we are halfway through spring, but if you look at the forecast this week, it seems like anything but. A huge spring chill will impact a large chunk of the country this week, dropping temperatures well below normal and even bringing the potential for a handful of record lows. “After 4 consecutive days with temperature departures of +20 to +30F mid-month, the stagnant cool pattern of late should mean April ends below normal for most,” the National Weather Service office in the Twin Cities said, speaking about the Upper Midwest. Monday morning, Indianapolis tied a record low temperature after a morning start of just 28 degrees. Just four days ago, Indianapolis nearly tied a record high temperature, missing it by only 1 degree. Many cities are bracing for a similar swing in temperature extremes in the coming days. The cold will spread south and east this week, where millions could see temperatures well below normal from the Upper Midwest to the South. Temperatures will be running 10 to 20 degrees below normal, potentially breaking a few low temperature records the first half of the week. The cold will spill pretty far south, affecting places from Texas to the East Coast. Asheville, North Carolina, could break a record low Tuesday morning if they get below freezing. The Tri-Cities area of Tennessee could also break a record low Tuesday morning. Temperatures will dip well below freezing across the Ohio Valley, which could kill crops and other vegetation. “It appears Wednesday night has the best shot for rather cold temperatures to occur. Lows could be quite damaging to tender vegetation in the middle 20s in the extreme east and lower 30s elsewhere,” the weather service office in Cleveland warned. Even parts of Georgia and the Gulf Coast states will dip close to freezing, as the big chill stretches as far south as the Gulf Coast. For parts of the northern tier and Midwest tired of the cold, and ready for the warmth of spring and summer, the cooler temps are having a beneficial impact on the region by slowing the inevitable flooding from snowmelt. The spring snowmelt is well underway, leading to major flooding across the Upper Midwest and along the Mississippi River. We talked about this occurring back in March, and now it is actually happening. This week, cities along the Mississippi River from Minneapolis to Burlington, Iowa, could experience flooding as more than 30 river gauges reach major flood stage. Unlike flash flooding, which occurs very rapidly, this is seasonal, spring river flooding, which is occurring rather gradually as record to near record snowpack across the Upper Midwest melts. This winter several cities in the Upper Midwest saw exceptional snowfall: Additional snowmelt across the Upper Midwest is expected to add more water to the rivers and streams this week. With forecast temperatures at or below average and minimal rainfall where snow is still on the ground, melting is expected to remain gradual. Cities experiencing flood effects this week and into the weekend include Minneapolis-St. Paul; Winona, Minnesota; La Crosse, Wisconsin; and McGregor, Dubuque and Davenport in Iowa. Riverside parks and city streets are expected to become submerged in floodwater. The river flooding will continue to move downstream along the Mississippi River as we move into May. Severe weather will start ramping up Tuesday and Wednesday across the South. While damaging winds and hail will be the main threats, tornadoes can’t be ruled out. On Tuesday, the Storm Prediction Center highlighted an area encompassing nearly 10 million people in Texas. Places like Dallas-Fort Worth are included in what the storm center has labeled as having a Level 2 of 5 “slight risk” of severe weather. “At this juncture, it appears Tuesday could end up being more of a low-coverage but high-impact day, perhaps with only a few storms but a higher-end threat potential,” the weather service office in Fort Worth said. There is a broader risk of severe weather stretching into Oklahoma, along with portions of southern Colorado and New Mexico. The Level 1 risk area includes San Antonio, Houston and Oklahoma City. Areas hit hard last week in Oklahoma from tornadoes, could experience strong storms once again. Despite the uncertainty in how the severe weather will unfold, “all severe hazards are possible,” the weather service office in Norman, Oklahoma, warned. By Wednesday, the severe threat broadens, still including many of the same areas from Tuesday. More than 10 million people are covered by Wednesday’s Level 2 risk for severe weather, including the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. A Level 1 risk extends to the north and south including places like San Antonio, Austin and Oklahoma City. The threat of flash flooding will also be a concern. The Weather Prediction Center has issued a Level 2 of 4 “slight risk” of excessive rainfall for Tuesday and Wednesday, mostly overlapping the areas with severe potential. “Multiple rounds of heavier rain are expected Tuesday into Wednesday which will bring a slight risk for flooding,” the weather service office in Norman, Oklahoma, warned in a tweet. The area could see up to four inches of rain through Wednesday. By the second half of the week, the severe weather and flash flood threat should be winding down across the midsection of the country. CNN Meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this report."

Geothermal heating and cooling could eventually be brought into homes and buildings using heat pumps, which are highly efficient appliances that circulate warm or cool air through buildings, according to the department. “That heat pump is basically run from heat in the ground,” Arlene Anderson, project manager for DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office, told CNN. “The fuel is basically the Earth source heat.” It’s part of a multi-year, $13 million project to explore how geothermal heating and cooling could be applied not only in rural areas but densely populated cities. After their year-long design phase, DOE will select a smaller number of these projects to fully fund and deploy. Details of the project were shared first with CNN. In the long run, the effort could help communities transition away from heating and cooling with energy from planet-warming fossil fuels. Residential energy use accounts for around 20% of the country’s climate emissions, and a large portion of that is from energy used to heat and cool homes. DOE’s announcement comes as the administration aims to make good on President Joe Biden’s promise to slash US carbon pollution in half by 2030. To get there, it’s looking to significantly increase wind energy and ramp up the adoption of electric vehicles. The administration is also expected to announce soon an aggressive new power plant rule that could dramatically reduce emissions from both coal and natural gas fired power plants. And the administration has found the climate potential of geothermal energy is huge. So far, it has only been used on a much smaller scale than other clean technologies like solar and wind. But a recent DOE report found geothermal energy for heating and cooling could reach 90 gigawatts by 2050, which would cut around 1 billion metric tons of planet-warming emissions – roughly the same amount as taking 20 million cars off the road per year. US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the technology “will expand the uses of clean energy in decarbonizing our communities,” and added that geothermal heating and cooling “can go a long way in decarbonizing the building and electricity sectors.” Geothermal technology can be used for two things: to produce electricity or to generate heat and warmth. This project will focus on the latter. To start the process, geothermal wells are drilled into the Earth – similar to a water well. The wells are outfitted with pipes which are installed in a closed loop so that water can circulate through them. That water is warmed up by the below-ground heat, and the warm water can then be used to power super-efficient heat pumps that push heat into or out of a building, depending on the season. Some individual houses currently use geothermal heating and cooling systems like this, Anderson told CNN, but it’s much rarer in the US to have systems that can power entire neighborhoods. There are 23 known communities that are using geothermal to heat and cool their buildings, according to the DOE. The best-known example of this, it says, is in Boise, where water warmed via geothermal energy is used to heat more than 6 million square feet of building space, according to the city’s website. Still, the US is behind the ball on the technology. “These are fairly common in Europe where geothermal is used in a district system, but not so much in the US,” Anderson said. “There’s a lot of competition from other energy sources, mostly oil, gas and coal. There’s also a lack of knowledge about this technology in the US even though it’s been around for a long time.” DOE’s goal is to eventually have a quarter of each of the selected communities’ overall heating and cooling be supplied by geothermal, Anderson said. And part of the goal of the first design phase is to see how well it can work in different communities of varying sizes and locations around the country. For instance, neighborhoods in two of America’s largest cities – New York City and Chicago – are planning to demonstrate how they can use geothermal to power hundreds of apartments and residential buildings. Duluth, Minnesota, which has a much colder climate, is planning to use a geothermal system that’s powered by wasted heat from their wastewater treatment plant, while the remote community of Nome, Alaska, wants to use the technology to help keep cool food storage areas, in addition to heating residential buildings. Anderson said DOE will spend the next month negotiating on funding for the design phase with each community. Once that is settled, the communities will each have a year to design their projects, including coming up with engineering designs that are “good enough to obtain permits,” according to Anderson. After that, DOE will move forward with a final selection process on a smaller number of projects. “We’re looking at a lot of different configurations, whether it’s rural, remote, or urban,” Anderson said. “It’s new for us; it’s exciting.”"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Dangerous, record-breaking heat waves are set to increase as the climate crisis intensifies, and they will be particularly devastating in countries and regions that are least prepared for them, according to a new study. Scientists analyzed temperature data sets spanning more than 60 years, as well as climate models, to calculate the likelihood of unprecedented heat extremes occurring – and where these might happen. They identified Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea and Central America – including Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua – as “hot spots” for high-risk heat waves. These regions are particularly vulnerable due to their fast-growing populations and limited access to healthcare and energy supplies, which undermine their resilience to extreme temperatures, according to the report, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. “There’s evidence there that those regions may well be in for a big heat wave and they wouldn’t be prepared for it,” said Dann Mitchell, a professor in atmospheric sciences at the University of Bristol in the UK and a study co-author. The threat facing Afghanistan is particularly stark, Mitchell told CNN. Not only is there high potential for record-breaking extreme heat, but the impacts will be intensified by the huge difficulties the country already faces, he said. Afghanistan is struggling with dire social and economic problems. It also has a growing population which is increasingly exposed to the problems of limited resources, according to the report. “When a really extreme heat wave does finally come along, then there are instantly going to be a lot of problems,” Mitchell said. Heat waves have a wide-ranging negative impact. They reduce air quality, worsen drought, increase the risk of wildfires and can lead infrastructure to buckle. They also take a heavy toll on human health, and extreme heat is one of the deadliest natural disasters. Heat stroke or heat exhaustion can trigger a wide range of dangerous symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, nausea and loss of consciousness, among others. Heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, causing body temperature to skyrocket in a matter of minutes, and can lead to permanent disability or death. Several regions have already seen unprecedented temperatures this year. In March, parts of Argentina grappled with temperatures up to 10 degrees Celsius, or 18 degrees Fahrenheit, above normal, while high temperature records were smashed across large parts of Asia in April. “Heat waves and other extreme weather events will only become more intense as the world continues to burn fossil fuels,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, who was not involved with the study. Nowhere is safe, noted the report, which found that “statistically implausible” heat waves – those that fell well outside the historical norm – occurred between 1959 and 2021 in around 30% of the regions assessed. These include the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave, where high temperature records were not just broken but completely smashed, killing hundreds of people. In Lytton, British Columbia, temperatures peaked at just under 50 degrees Celsius (121 degrees Fahrenheit) in June 2021, breaking the previous record by almost 5 degrees. The village was almost completely destroyed by a wildfire just days later. Scientists determined that the event would have been almost impossible without climate change. Parts of China, including Beijing, and European countries, such as Germany and Belgium, also face a high risk, according to the report. The millions of people who live in these densely populated regions could be badly affected by heat waves, even if these countries are more likely to have resources to mitigate some of the worst impacts. The report calls on governments around the world to prepare for heat events that go far beyond current record temperatures, such as setting up cooling centers and reducing hours for those working outside. Many policies exist that governments can implement to save lives, Otto said, including “preparing heat wave management plans, ensuring and testing they are implemented, informing the public about imminent heat waves, and protecting people who are vulnerable to the impacts of heat waves.” Unprecedented heat events are becoming more likely as the world continues to burn fossil fuels, said Lucas Vargas Zeppetello, a research fellow at Harvard University, whose 2022 research found that dangerous levels of heat are set to at least triple across the world by the end of the century. “By definition, we don’t know what could happen if large populations are exposed to unprecedented heat and humidity stress,” Vargas Zeppetello told CNN, “but heat waves in the past few decades have already been extremely deadly and there is serious cause for concern in the future.”"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","The unrelenting drought that has devastated the Horn of Africa and left more than 20 million people facing acute food insecurity would not have been possible without climate change, a new analysis has found. Since October 2020, this part of East Africa, one of the world’s most impoverished regions, has been gripped by its worst drought in 40 years as an unprecedented five consecutive rainy seasons have failed. The drought has brought catastrophic impacts to large areas of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia: Tens of thousands have died, crops have shriveled, livestock have starved and chronic hunger and water insecurity are widespread and growing. In a world without human-caused climate change, this devastating drought would not have happened. That’s the conclusion of a rapid attribution study released on Thursday by the World Weather Attribution initiative. The organization is made up of a team of international scientists who, in the immediate aftermath of extreme weather events, analyze data and climate models to establish what role climate change played. In the Horn of Africa, they found that planet-heating pollution caused by burning fossil fuels has made the region’s ongoing agricultural drought 100 times more likely – and that’s a conservative estimate, they said. Higher temperatures have significantly increased the amount of water evaporating from plants and soils, according to the study, causing crop losses, livestock death and water shortages. The planet’s average temperature is now around 1.2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels of the late 1800s. Without that warming, the region would not have experienced this severe agricultural drought, the report found. The scientists also looked at whether climate change was to blame for the lack of rain, but concluded there was no overall impact. The report found that while climate change makes low rainfall twice as likely during the region’s “long rains” season, which runs from March to May, it actually makes the “short rains,” between October and December, wetter. The reason this wetter trend has been absent in the Horn of Africa over the last few years is because of the influence of La Niña, a natural climate phenomenon that brings dryer conditions to the region during the short rains period. Human-caused global heating is making droughts across the world longer and more extreme. The blistering drought that affected the Northern Hemisphere last summer, including large parts of the US, Europe and China, was made 20 times more likely by the climate crisis, according to an October analysis from the the World Weather Attribution group. Scientists say droughts will only become more severe if the world continues to burn fossil fuels. Regions that are already vulnerable face the worst impacts. The climate change-fueled disaster in the Horn of Africa has brought devastation to a region already suffering from a slew of problems, including global price hikes following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and deadly internal conflicts. Much of the population are farmers that rely on rainfall for crops and livestock. They have been plunged even further into poverty as the rains failed. At least 8 million farm animals are estimated to have died during the drought. “This has actually forced people to migrate to other regions in search of either water or pasture for their crops, or also just food for their families,” said Phoebe Wafubwa, an adviser at the International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent in Kenya. Around 1.7 million people in Ethiopia and Somalia have had to leave their homes because of the impacts of the drought, according to the report, and hunger levels are sky-high. More than 20 million people in the Horn of Africa have been pushed into crisis levels of food insecurity, or worse, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In Somalia, which has been teetering on the edge of famine, more than 43,000 people are estimated to have been killed by the drought, half of whom were children under five years old. “Almost half of country’s population is affected, over 3 million people are displaced,” Mamunur Rahman Malik, the Somalia representative for the World Health Organization, told CNN. “The country continues to pay the price of global warming and climate change,” he added. “The findings of this study show that frequent multi-year droughts compounded with heat extremes, in the main rainy season, will severely impact food security and human health in the Horn of Africa as the climate continues to warm,” Joyce Kimutai, principal meteorologist and climate scientist at the Kenya Meteorological Department, said in a statement. The region is seeing some relief during the current rainy season, although it has brought flash flooding to parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. “The expectation is that the drought is coming to a close,” Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at UC Santa Barbara, told CNN. But it will be a very long road to recovery. The current rains are “not substantial enough” to see a significant improvement to food security, Kimutai explained on a call with reporters. And the region can expect more extreme dry conditions in the future. As the world continues to warm, “we expect to see the combined effect of low precipitation with (high) temperatures causing really exceptional droughts in this part of the world,” she said."

On Thursday, they are expected to surpass 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Guadalquivir River valley, which includes the cities of Cordoba and Seville, according to the Spanish national weather service. On Wednesday, Cordoba and Seville airports both surpassed 36 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Fahrenheit), shattering the previous records for April temperatures set in 1997, Spain’s national weather agency AEMET reported. Nighttime temperatures are also forecast to remain high, not dipping below 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) in some places. Schools in central and southern Spain are concerned about protecting students and staff from overheated classrooms that don’t have air conditioning, Spanish media reported. Some are considering shifting timetables to put outdoor exercise activities earlier in the school day. The heat could increase risks of wildfires in the country, which has already seen unusually early fires burn more than 10,000 acres in the country’s eastern region of Castellon in late March. The high temperatures come as a prolonged drought has gripped parts of southern Spain, as well as the northeast of the country, near Barcelona. Rainfall has been very low, with March levels just 36% compared with the monthly average rainfall, Spain’s Ministry of Ecological Transition reported. The country has experienced 36 consecutive months of below-average rainfall, with reservoirs at only about half of their capacity, Reuters reported. In Catalonia, northeastern Spain, reservoir water levels are at about 25% and there are already some water restrictions in place. The lack of water is having a severe impact on the country’s farmers. “The situation for agriculture due to the drought is very worrisome across Spain but in the areas most affected, it could be called agonizing,” said UPA, the Union for Small Farmers and Ranchers. “Even fruit and olive trees, which normally are more resistant to drought, are heavily affected, because there have been years of low precipitation and intense heat,” UPA said on its website. The early extreme heat is expected to continue into the weekend, according to AEMET."

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. One of Earth’s largest habitats could see its rich diversity of life reduced by the end of the century due to the climate crisis. The ocean’s mesopelagic zone, also called the “twilight zone,” is located between 656 feet and 3,280 feet (200 meters to 1,000 meters) below the surface. The marine region, which accounts for approximately a quarter of the ocean’s volume, is home to billions of metric tons of organic matter and some of Earth’s most stunning biodiversity, despite being beyond the reach of sunlight. The twilight zone also a crucial habitat for marine life that dives in search of prey, like sharks, or lanternfish that hide in the twilight zone during the day and swim to the surface waters to feed at night. New research warns that the climate crisis could reduce life in the twilight zone between 20% and 40% by the end of the century. And if greenhouse gas emissions continue, the researchers estimate that the ocean region’s life could be severely depleted within 150 years — and recovery may not be possible for thousands of years. Paleontologists and ocean scientists teamed up to study the impacts on the ocean’s twilight zone during previous ancient warming events in order to predict how the habitat may respond in the future due to global warming. The research team studied cores taken from the seafloor that included evidence of preserved microscopic shells from plankton. Over time, the calcium carbonate shells accumulate on the seafloor, preserving information about what the environment was like during their lifetime. The tiny shells effectively create a timeline of how the ocean has changed over millions of years. A study detailing the findings was published Thursday in the journal Nature Communications. “We still know relatively little about the ocean twilight zone, but using evidence from the past we can understand what may happen in the future,” said lead study author Dr. Katherine Crichton, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, in a statement. The researchers focused on two warm periods that occurred 15 million years ago and 50 million years ago, where even ocean temperatures were “markedly warmer than today,” according to the study. “We found that the twilight zone was not always a rich habitat full of life,” said study coauthor Paul Pearson, an honorary professor at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom, in a statement. “In these warm periods, far fewer organisms lived in the twilight zone, because much less food arrived from surface waters.” Particles of organic matter from the ocean’s surface drift down and serve as one of the main food sources for life in the twilight zone. But past warming events caused the material to be degraded more quickly by bacteria, so less of it reached the ocean region. Warmer ocean temperatures also increase the metabolic rates of organisms, leading to increased food demand and oxygen consumption, according to the study. “The rich variety of twilight zone life evolved in the last few million years, when ocean waters had cooled enough to act rather like a fridge, preserving the food for longer, and improving conditions allowing life to thrive,” Crichton said. Luiz A. Rocha, curator and Follett Chair of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences, worries that changes are underway that haven’t been detected because the twilight zone is so understudied, largely due to a disconnect between funding and the costs of exploring this region. Rocha, who was not involved in the study, researches the twilight zone and the mesophotic zone just above it, located between 98 and 492 feet (30 and 150 meters) below the surface. “There are no baseline data to compare what we are measuring against, so this study that looks at the composition of the fossil record over time is one of the few ways we can try to understand how we are causing the twilight zone to change,” Rocha said. Based on what they discovered from the ancient warming events, the researchers combined that data with Earth system mode simulations — modeling of Earth’s carbon cycle as it moves through the land, sea and atmosphere. The team’s work revealed what is currently occurring in the twilight zone and how that might change in the future across decades, centuries and even millennia as the world warms. “Our findings suggest that significant changes may already be under way,” Crichton said. “Unless we rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this could lead to the disappearance or extinction of much twilight zone life within 150 years, with effects spanning millennia thereafter. Even a low-emissions future may have a significant impact, but that would be far less severe than medium- and high-emissions scenarios. Our study is a first step to finding out how vulnerable this ocean habitat may be to climate warming.” The researchers used three emissions scenarios based on the total carbon dioxide emissions after 2010. The low estimate was 625 billion metric tons, medium was 2,500 billion metric tons and high was 5,000 billion metric tons. The Global Carbon Budget estimates that the total global carbon dioxide emissions in 2022 was 40.6 billion metric tons. Yearly emissions have been close to that number each year since 2010, so the researchers noted that the low-estimate scenario they used has already been emitted. The team thinks the medium emissions scenario will have been reached in about 50 years, and the high estimate in just over a century. “The twilight zone plays an important role in the ocean’s carbon cycle because most of the carbon dioxide taken up by phytoplankton ends up there as their remains sink down from the surface ocean,” said study coauthor Jamie Wilson, a postdoctoral researcher at the UK’s University of Liverpool, in a statement. INTERACTIVE: See what’s at risk of disappearing on Earth “One of the challenges of predicting how this movement of carbon might change in the future is that there are many processes to disentangle in the modern ocean. By looking back at the twilight zone in past warm periods we can identify the most important processes and use those to predict the future. We found that this natural cycling of carbon is likely already changing and may be perturbed long into the future.” The climate crisis has impacted Earth’s oceans in the form of pollution, warming, deoxygenation, acidification and overfishing, according to the study. These effects have caused conservationists to consider different protective efforts, such as restricting harmful activities in the oceans. Protecting the twilight zone will be difficult since typical conservation efforts, such as preventing fishing or deep-sea mining, can’t apply there, Rocha said. “A marine protected area for the (twilight zone) makes very little sense because the impacts that are affecting it are global in nature,” he said. “What we really need to protect the (twilight zone) is to stop, or at least slow down, the high rate of change that we are subjecting our planet’s climate to.”"

Nothing is going to be harvested,” he said.                                             ","Fred Pleitgen, Claudia Otto and Laura Paddison, CNN","Standing in his field of stunted, withered maize, Santi Caudevilla is very worried. “If the weather does not change it will be zero. Nothing is going to be harvested,” he said. Caudevilla, who grows maize, sorghum and other crops in Gimenells in Catalonia, has been hit hard by the severe drought which has hammered this part of northeastern Spain. Rainfall has been low for years. “We are in a desert. This is a desert today,” he said. The lack of water is starting to feel like an existential crisis for farmers such as Caudevilla and he is worried about the future of his profession. It’s becoming increasingly hard to make ends meet as crops shrivel through lack of water – or cannot be planted at all. Droughts are a fact of life in this corner of Spain. “They are typical of Catalonia’s Mediterranean climate,” said Albert Ruhi, a freshwater ecologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is originally from Catalonia. But a significant lack of rain and snow have made this one much, much drier, he told CNN. “This is the worst period that we have had for the last 100 years,” Samuel Reyes, director of the Catalan Water Agency, told CNN. The problem spreads beyond Catalonia. Spain has been in a long-term drought since the end of 2022, said Ricardo Torrijo, a spokesperson for AEMET, the Spanish national weather service. In March, the country only received 36% of the average monthly rainfall, making it the second driest March this century. The trend continued into April, which could end up being the driest on record, Torrijo told CNN. Drought conditions have been exacerbated by searing temperatures that are more reminiscent of mid-July than spring. Last Thursday, April records were smashed, with the city of Córdoba in southern Spain reaching 38.8 degrees Celsius (101.8 degrees Fahrenheit). The combination of drought and heat have stoked fears for a repeat of last summer where the country saw blistering heat waves and wildfires that burned through 306,000 hectares (756,000 acres). Unusually early wildfires this spring have already burned more than 10,000 acres in the eastern region of Castellon. These conditions point to a new reality for parts of Europe, which is warming twice as fast as the global average. While it will take time to pin down the exact role climate change is playing, scientists are clear that human-caused global heating is making droughts and heat waves more common and more extreme. The cracked, desiccated earth at the Sau Reservoir reveals the heavy toll the lack of rainfall has taken on Catalonia’s water sources. Located about 60 miles north of Barcelona, the reservoir is a key drinking water source for the region, but in late April it was only at 7% of capacity. Its water levels are so low that a medieval village, flooded when the lake was created in the 1960s, has emerged, lending an eerie presence to the sun-baked lakebed. Authorities have been forced to siphon out water from the reservoir in an attempt to protect water quality and have had to remove native fish to stop them asphyxiating. Reservoir levels across Catalonia are hovering at around 25%, substantially lower than usual for this time of year. The lack of water is having a catastrophic impact on farms across the region. “There is no precedent,” said Martí Costal, head of water at the Young Farmers and Ranchers of Catalonia (JARC). The majority of wheat and barley harvests on rainfed land will be lost, and on irrigated land will be cut by half, Costal told CNN. “If it does not rain in May it will be a disaster,” he said. It’s a story which tracks across the country’s agricultural heartlands. Drought affects 60% of Spain’s countryside, and has destroyed crops across 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres), according to the Coordinator of Farmers’ and Ranchers’ Organizations (COAG). That’s an area bigger than the state of Maryland. Livestock farming is at risk as farmers need pasture to feed their animals. Without it, they are forced to buy food. Losses are also expected for orchards, vineyards, olive oil production and vegetable farming, Serge Zaka, an agrometeorologist, told CNN. “These agro-climatic conditions are leading to an agricultural disaster,” he said. A lack of vegetation is also preventing bees from making honey. Beekeepers are facing a third consecutive season without a harvest thanks to water shortages, according to COAG. In April, Spain requested emergency funding from the European Union to help farmers cope with the impacts of the drought. Water scarcity is not just affecting farmers, but also drinking water. The village of Castellcir, around 30 miles north of Barcelona, is one of many in Catalonia that have been relying on water brought in on trucks. People have been asked to save water by having quick showers, being careful when washing dishes and not filling their pools. The situation has been going on for more than a year, said Juan Cogdony, a resident of the village. “We are very worried,” he told CNN. It just won’t rain, Cogdony said, looking up at the sky. “There is no water. Beer, yes, but no water,” he joked. As the summer approaches, and the hope of heavy spring rains fade, many are sounding the alarm on what might be in store for Spain. “We are now in a very dramatic situation,” said Joan Girona Gomis, a scientist at the Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology, a research organization owned by the Catalonian government. Without significant rain “we will suffer a bad drought this summer,” he told CNN. Gomis has been working on experiments to increase the efficiency of irrigation systems used by farmers, including by using technology such as sensors to evaluate the precise amount of water crops need. Whether Catalonia can remain one of Europe’s key farming regions is “the big question,” Gomis said. It all depends on “if we are able to adapt.” It will mean big changes, Costal said, including researching drought-resistant crops, investment in urban and agricultural infrastructure and improvements in water efficiency. He hopes what’s happening in Spain and other parts of Europe will remind people where their food comes from. “The fruits are produced in the field, not on the shelves of a supermarket,” he said. In Gimenells, Caudevilla is deeply worried about what will happen to the Catalonian countryside if, as expected, droughts and heat waves become more frequent and more intense. “This area is facing abandonment,” he said. Farmers are aging, he added, “in 10 years nobody will want to work in this countryside.” Fred Pleitgen and Claudia Otto reported from Spain, Laura Paddison reported from London"

",Analysis by Ronald Brownstein,"Even as billions of dollars in new clean energy investments surge into Republican leaning communities around the country, state and federal GOP officials are hardening their resistance to efforts to reduce the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels. That stark contrast has dashed a central hope and expectation among environmentalists: the belief that more economic opportunity in red places would mean less political opposition from Republicans to the transition toward a clean energy economy that scientists say is necessary to reduce the risk of catastrophic global climate change. The persistence of GOP opposition to that transition underscores the limits of economic incentives to overcome ideological inclinations – and points toward years of pitched partisan conflict that could make it virtually impossible for the US to set a consistent course on climate policy. This dynamic was encapsulated last week when virtually every House Republican voted, in the party’s debt ceiling plan, to repeal the clean energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats passed last year, even though those incentives have already triggered investments in 72 Republican-held districts, including over two dozen districts that have received massive investments of $1 billion or more in new plants or expansions of existing facilities. It’s also apparent in decisions by Republican state attorneys general from states that are among the top beneficiaries of new clean energy investments and jobs to launch a flurry of lawsuits and other legal proceedings against proposals from President Joe Biden’s administration to speed the transition toward a low-carbon economy. This opposition contravenes the traditional assumption that politicians almost always support the economic interests creating opportunity for their constituents. With growing boldness, Republicans and conservative activists are framing defense of fossil fuels and skepticism of clean energy alternatives as a form of culture war – with the transition to wind, solar and electric vehicles taking its place alongside transgender rights, “woke” indoctrination in the classroom or restrictions on gun ownership as an example of “coastal elites” trying to erase traditional American values. In opposing measures to promote clean energy even in places benefiting from new investments to produce it, “Republicans believe – and the next election will help us see whether this is a good strategy or not – that culture war is going to be better to help them win than talking about jobs and the economy,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University. In all these ways, climate change has become another fissure along the central fault line in modern American politics. Like attitudes toward demographic and cultural change, perspectives on shifting the nation’s energy mix from its historic reliance on fossil fuels toward low-carbon alternatives now pit the Democratic “coalition of transformation” that largely embraces the way America is changing on every front against the Republican “coalition of restoration” that resists it. For many Republicans, the Inflation Reduction Act’s sweeping provisions to encourage carbon-free energy sources aren’t “a bipartisan domestic energy agenda,” even though those incentives are channeling substantial jobs and investment to red places, said Robert McNally, a Republican energy consultant and former White House energy adviser for President George W. Bush. “This is a left wing, coastal ‘let’s change the world by having the federal government intervene at a time of high inflation kind of thing.’ When a Republican member does the pros and cons, it’s not like they don’t see the pros, but they see a lot of cons.” Republican-leaning states, as I’ve written, are generally more integrated into the existing fossil fuel economy than blue-leaning places. Trump won 20 of the 21 states that emit the most carbon from their energy sector per each dollar of economic activity, mostly states between the coasts that are either big producers of fossil fuels (Wyoming, West Virginia, Texas) or big consumers of it to power robust agricultural and manufacturing sectors (Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Indiana). Biden in turn won 19 of the 21 states with the least emissions, most of them coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, and California. Representation in the House and Senate, and control of state governments, follow these same tracks, with Republicans dominating the high-emitting states and Democrats dominating those with lower emissions. Oil and gas companies now routinely direct about four-fifths of their campaign contributions toward Republicans in Congress. But the energy transition now underway is remaking this picture. Red places are among the clear winners in the emerging clean energy economy. Of the five states that produced the most wind-generated electricity in 2022, according to federal statistics, four are solidly red: Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and Kansas; Illinois is the sole exception. Big solar generating states include Texas and Florida, as well as Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – places where Republicans control the state legislature, the governorship or both. The Inflation Reduction Act that passed last year on a party line vote is further diffusing these opportunities, though no Republican legislators in either the House or the Senate voted for it. Overall, as of March 31, companies have announced “191 new clean energy projects in small towns and bigger cities nationwide totaling $242.81 billion in new investments,” according to a recent report by the environmental advocacy group Climate Power. Those investments are projected to create some 142,000 jobs, the group calculated. Of the 10 states that have received the most announced clean energy projects, the group found, only two are safely Democratic (New York and California.) The rest are either battleground states (Michigan, Arizona and Georgia) or Republican-leaning (Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee). The red tilt on investment is similarly pronounced at the congressional district level. In another study, Climate Power found that over half of all the new clean energy projects announced since the bill’s passage have been located in Republican-held congressional districts. The Republican district projects account, stunningly, for nearly four-fifths of the total clean energy investments that have been announced. The group found that two dozen House Republicans hold seats where clean energy companies have committed to investments of $1 billion or more since the passage of the IRA. The district that has received the most investment is held by New York Republican Rep. Brandon Williams (whose New York seat is the site of a massive plant that will manufacture semiconductors for EVs) and the district projected to receive the most jobs is held by Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei (which has attracted four separate projects). A South Korean company is building a $2.5 billion solar panel manufacturing facility in the Georgia district of far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Many reasons may explain why so much of the new clean energy investment has flowed into red places. Most important may be that Republican states and districts tilt more toward rural areas where space for large manufacturing facilities is easier to acquire. In those states, taxes are typically lower and state regulations more lenient as well. Some companies are also attracted to the non-union environment in most red states. Whatever the motivation for the companies, environmentalists have hoped that channeling more economic benefits from the energy transition into red places would soften the opposition of Republicans toward deemphasizing fossil fuels. The model some cite is how the spread of defense contracts across virtually every congressional district maximizes support for the Pentagon budget. Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, sees that precedent as critical to sustaining a long-term federal effort behind promoting clean energy. “What we need it to become is the defense authorization act, where every single congressional district has a piece of it – and it can’t be undone and we are set on this path of reaching our goals because of how diffuse it is,” she says. But establishing those political roots, she acknowledges, will take time, and in the near term, the torrent of new investment has not diminished Republican resistance. If anything, as Biden leans into measures to accelerate the energy transition, Republicans are stiffening their opposition. “The harder one side pushes, the harder the other way the other side wants to push back,” said Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a conservative group that supports action on climate change. Last week, almost every House Republican voted for the sweeping bill to raise the debt ceiling that included the repeal of the extensive incentives in the IRA for both producers and consumers to shift to clean energy sources. Earlier this year, every House and Senate Republican, under an act allowing Congress to challenge federal regulations, voted to overturn a Department of Labor rule that would allow pension fund managers to consider so-called ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) goals in making investment decisions – which is considered one important way to encourage more investment in green industries. Biden vetoed that change, but a coalition of Republican state attorneys general are still seeking to block the regulation in court. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 GOP presidential candidate, recently organized a coalition of 19 Republican governors to fight such ESG measures, which he derides as “woke capitalism.” West Virginia’s Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has hinted that when the federal Environmental Protection Agency completes its proposed fuel economy regulations requiring a rapid shift toward electric vehicles, GOP AGs will sue to overturn that, too. No one would be surprised if such a coalition of Republican-controlled states sues as well to block the regulations the Biden EPA is developing to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. (Such a coalition successfully sued to block former President Barack Obama’s regulations on the same topic.) And it seems inevitable that whenever the EPA completes both its fuel economy and power plant regulations that congressional Republicans will attempt to override them as well. From Republicans, predicts McNally, there will be “complete and total opposition on all fronts” to the coming Biden climate regulations. “It will be kitchen sink – everything will be going at it.” Reams is cautiously optimistic that if Republicans obtained unified control of the White House and Congress in 2025, they would preserve at least some of the IRA’s clean energy incentives as part of an “all of the above” strategy to encourage more domestic production of both fossil fuels and low-carbon sources. But McNally, in a view shared from across the political spectrum by Lodes, predicts that if Republicans win unified control, they will “gut” the IRA clean energy incentives that they voted to eliminate last week. “Ninety-eight percent of this is going to go,” he says. When I reached out to several House Republicans last week to ask why they voted to rescind the IRA incentives although their districts have received big clean energy investments, most either did not respond or refused to comment. (In the latter camp was Utah Rep. John Curtis, who chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus and whose district has received $11 billion in clean energy investments, according to Climate Power.) One who did respond was Amodei, the Nevada Republican. He exemplifies the depth of Republican skepticism to the Democratic agenda to combat climate change. His northern Nevada district contains not only a massive (and expanding) Tesla plant, but also a factory being built by another battery company, Redwood Materials. Between them, the Redwood plant and Tesla expansion are expected to create 4,600 permanent manufacturing jobs as well as many construction jobs, according to news accounts. Yet Amodei voted last week to repeal all the IRA’s incentives to encourage more production and consumption of electric vehicles. In an interview, he said the pace at which Biden and Democrats want to transition transportation toward EVs was unrealistic. “Do I think electricity is the future? Absolutely,” Amodei said. But he added, “even with all these billions of dollars being poured into these things in the form of subsidies and penalties” the rate at which Biden hopes to shift Americans into electric vehicles “borders on suicidal.” Moreover, he asserted that Nevada companies are largely being excluded from the construction jobs generated by the big plant expansions in his district, and that the bigger concern for most constituents he represents is the risk that the IRA’s increased spending will fuel inflation. “The benefits” of the bill, he says, “I don’t think outweigh the negative stuff in terms of debt, inflation and oh, by the way, how much really came to Nevada?” Amodei is one of the Republican members that Climate Power and the League of Conservation Voters have already targeted with ads criticizing their votes. Lodes says his claim that Nevada residents aren’t benefiting from the new jobs in his district “just doesn’t hold water.” She says the group’s challenge is to make clear to voters in the Republican districts benefiting from clean energy investments that their Representatives voted to repeal the incentives encouraging that spending. “The case we will have to make to voters is that every single one of these MAGA extremists put their agenda ahead of their constituents,” she says. That argument could prove effective in some swing districts, particularly those with a large number of college-educated voters. But most House Republicans represent solidly GOP-leaning areas. And demand for action against climate change has remained minimal inside the GOP coalition. Leiserowitz says that in Yale’s polling, only a very small percentage of even moderate Republicans cite climate as an important issue for government to address and that the share of all Republicans who support developing more clean energy sources is actually dropping. Republican voters are far more likely to say they support more domestic drilling for oil and gas. The vast majority of Republican voters even say they will never consider buying an electric vehicle, according to a recent Gallup poll. Democrats mostly take the opposite positions, placing far greater priority on climate change as a problem and expressing much more interest in changing not only public policy but also their personal behavior to combat it. Reams says that disparity has created a striking dynamic, with Republican-leaning communities producing the clean energy favored by Democratic-leaning consumers: “You have a phenomenon of red supply for blue demand,” she says. Like many environmentalists to her left, Reams believes that as the clean energy industries become more “ingrained” in GOP-leaning areas, “more Republicans will say ‘I can’t repeal that.’” The historical behavior of members of Congress says she’s right; but those precedents may no longer apply. Over time, more clean energy investments and jobs in Republican-leaning places should make the case for transition more compelling. Likewise, even in those red areas, more consumers may also experience benefits from renewable power sources or the cost savings of operating electric vehicles. “Clean energy, electric vehicles, all the things associated with these things are going to become part of normal life in America,” says Leiserowitz. The result is that people “will ask, ‘How can you be against something when everybody is doing it?’” But all these traditional dynamics could be offset if clean energy continues to get pulled into the right’s culture war case against “woke” elites. Across a panoramic range of issues – from abortion, LGBTQ rights and guns to classroom censorship and book bans – Republicans, especially in red states, are looking to impose the cultural values of their predominantly conservative electoral coalition against what they consider liberal efforts to uproot the US from its traditions. So long as Republican voters are convinced to see the clean energy transition as part of that threat, even gleaming new factories and fat new paychecks may not much soften the party’s sweeping resistance to climate action."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/03/us/new-york-natural-gas-ban-climate/index.html,New York becomes the first state to ban natural gas stoves and furnaces in most new buildings,05/03/2023,"                                                 New York is the first state in the country to ban natural gas and other fossil fuels in most new buildings – a major win for climate advocates, but a move that could spark pushback from fossil fuel interests.                                             ","Rachel Ramirez and Ella Nilsen, CNN","New York is the first state in the country to ban natural gas and other fossil fuels in most new buildings – a major win for climate advocates, but a move that could spark pushback from fossil fuel interests. Facing mounting pressure from environmental advocates and climate-minded voters, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Democratic lawmakers, who control the New York Senate and Assembly, approved the new $229 billion state budget containing the provision late Tuesday night. The law bans gas-powered stoves, furnaces and propane heating and effectively encourages the use of climate-friendly appliances such as heat pumps and induction stoves in most new residential buildings across the state. It requires all-electric heating and cooking in new buildings shorter than seven stories by 2026, and for taller buildings by 2029. The state’s budget doesn’t ban gas in all new buildings – there are exceptions for large commercial and industrial buildings like stores, hospitals, laundromats, and restaurants, for instance. But the impact on new residential buildings could be significant. Buildings account for 32% of New York State’s planet-warming emissions, according to a 2022 report. Methane, the main component of natural gas used to fuel stoves and heat homes, has more than 80 times as much warming power as carbon dioxide in the first two decades it’s in the atmosphere. For that reason, scientists have narrowed in on the fossil fuel as a way to rapidly decrease planet-warming pollution. Several studies also have found that gas stoves are responsible for severe health conditions, including asthma. The law’s passage comes after a federal official’s comments on gas stoves sparked controversy earlier this year. Richard Trumka Jr., a US Consumer Product Safety commissioner, set off a firestorm when he said in January that gas stoves were a significant source of indoor pollution linked to childhood asthma, and suggested that the agency could be working to ban them in new homes. Trumka later clarified his statement, saying the agency is “not looking to go into anyone’s homes and take away items that are already there.” While New York is the first state to pass such a law, other cities have led the way. In 2019, Berkeley became the first US city to pass a code banning natural gas hookups in new buildings. Other cities, including San Francisco in 2020 and New York City in 2021, quickly followed suit. But other municipalities looking to take similar action have run into brick walls. More than a dozen states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas. In a statement, Hochul spokesperson Katy Zielinski said the new budget “will protect our families and our residents, while putting New York on trajectory to a cleaner, healthier future.” Alex Beauchamp, the northeast region director at Food & Water Watch, an environment non-profit that focuses on food and water issues, called the deal “a historic step,” but said the state is moving “too slowly” on climate action. “New Yorkers are resisting fossil fuels everywhere they pop up, from the power plants that pollute our air to the pipelines that put our communities in harm’s way. Now buildings can be a part of that solution,” Beauchamp said. “We won’t stop fighting until we end our devastating addiction to fossil fuels.” The natural gas industry pushed back on the state’s new law, characterizing it as taking away choices for consumers. “Any push to ban natural gas would raise costs to consumers, jeopardize environmental progress and deny affordable energy to underserved populations,” American Gas Association president and CEO Karen Harbert said in a statement. One legal expert who follows natural gas bans told CNN that while New York’s ban is “potentially a very big deal,” it could face legal challenges. “I do wonder how these legal fights are going to play out over this,” said Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law. Fox noted that the California Restaurant Association successfully challenged the city of Berkeley’s ban on gas stoves. (New York’s law carves out an exception for restaurants.) But the fact that New York wields the power of a state could have an impact on legal repercussions, Fox added. “I think it’s huge that a state is doing it, not only because New York is a big-impact state,” Fox said. “It takes it outside of this narrative of these are these fringe cities passing these policies. This is becoming a mainstream policy that a state like New York is taking on.” Fox noted that even with a conservative Supreme Court, this could ultimately be seen as being the purview of a state’s right to pass its own laws. “I think we’re going to learn in the coming months about how strategic you have to be about where those legal problems are going to present themselves,” Fox said. In addition to banning natural gas, New York’s budget deal pushes other climate change efforts, including creating publicly owned renewable energy projects that would create green jobs as well as a cap-and-invest program that would make companies with a higher carbon footprint purchase permits to pollute. The revenue the cap-and-invest program raises would go toward initiatives that offset the impact of planet-warming pollution. It’s been three years since New York implemented its landmark climate law, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, that commits the state to net-zero emissions by 2050. But each year, the state adds roughly 250,000 metric tons of planet-warming pollution from the tens of thousands of new homes and buildings that are built with gas installations, according to an analysis by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a non-profit organization that advocates for the transition to clean energy. Zielinski also noted the New York Power Authority is working on plans to decarbonize 15 state facilities with the most greenhouse gas emissions. The plans “will accelerate our progress towards a cleaner building sector, support the creation of high-quality jobs at future decarbonization projects including thermal energy networks, and move the State closer to reaching our climate goals,” Zielinski said in a statement. This story has been updated with additional information."

In March, European countries agreed to promote a global phase-out of fossil fuels in a text setting out their priorities for COP28. “The shift towards a climate neutral economy will require the global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels,” the text said. More than 80 countries supported a commitment to phase out oil, coal and gas at COP27 in Egypt last year, but Saudi Arabia and other oil and gas producing nations opposed it. Tasneem Essop, the executive director of Climate Action Network, an alliance of environmental groups, told CNN that it was “concerning” that Al Jaber was speaking about a “‘foreseeable future for fossil fuels’ and a ‘phase out of emissions.’” “A plan to end the era of fossil fuels should be central to the discussions and outcomes from COP28,” she said. Nils Bartsch, head of oil and gas research at the German non-profit Urgewald, told CNN the world faces “an absolute carbon budget for 1.5 degrees Celsius. Reducing emissions intensity of oil and gas production does not change that – it just helps to exhaust our budget a little slower.” Scientists have said that the world should make every effort to stay under 1.5 degrees of global warming above pre-industrial levels, and nations have been working to keep that goal within reach at the annual climate summits. Al Jaber emphasized the role of technologies like carbon capture in reducing planet-heating pollution. However, some experts are concerned that these technologies remain prohibitively expensive, are unproven at scale and would take too long to implement, given the urgency of the climate crisis. “We cannot pretend the solutions to the climate crisis lie with unreliable, untested techno fixes that will bring new risks and threats,” Essop told CNN. Al Jaber was a controversial pick to oversee COP28. He is also CEO of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers. Some, however, welcomed Al Jaber’s appointment. US climate envoy John Kerry told Associated Press that he was “a terrific choice,” citing his commitment to expanding renewable energy. Al Jaber used the Berlin conference to set out priorities, including tripling renewable energy by 2030, doubling hydrogen production, expanding nuclear power and improving battery storage. He also called on rich countries to deliver on their funding promises to climate-vulnerable countries. In 2009, wealthy nations pledged to mobilize $100 billion in annual climate funding, but they have consistently fallen far short of that target. Al Jaber said this failure to deliver is hindering progress and undermining trust. He asked countries to “supercharge” climate finance. “What I hear time and again is that climate finance is simply not available, not accessible, and not affordable,” Al Jaber said in Berlin on Tuesday. “If the world doesn’t come up with effective mechanisms to deliver climate finance to developing and emerging economies, they will have no choice but to choose a carbon-intensive development path.” This year’s COP28 is considered particularly significant because it will include the first “global stocktake,” which will evaluate countries’ progress towards climate targets. “All indicators… are telling us that we are way off track,” said Al Jaber. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, also speaking at the Berlin conference on Wednesday, said it will be important that “we actually take stock of what we have achieved and the targets we set ourselves. We have to get out of fossil fuels, we have to dramatically reduce emissions.” “it is no longer about visions. It is finally about delivering on the pledges we made,” she said. CNN’s Chris Stern and Elizabeth Wells contributed reporting"

But the impacts are potentially catastrophic if temperatures continue to head off the charts.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","Ocean surface heat is at record-breaking levels. Temperatures began climbing in mid-March and skyrocketed over the course of several weeks, leaving scientists scrambling to figure out exactly why. Temperatures have fallen since their peak in April – as they naturally do in the spring – but they are still higher than they have ever been on record for this time of year. “It is remarkable,” said Gregory C. Johnson, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates the ocean surface temperature using a network of ships, buoys, satellites and floats. Although it’s still preliminary data, if it holds up, he said, “this is another milestone.” The record may not seem huge – it’s nearly two-tenths of a degree higher than the previous record in 2016 – but given how much heat is needed to warm up this huge body of water, “it’s a massive amount of energy,” Matthew England, professor of ocean and climate dynamics at the University of New South Wales, Australia, told CNN. What’s behind this rapid increase isn’t totally clear yet. “These temperatures just rocketed up, people haven’t had a chance to puzzle it all out,” Johnson said. Some scientists are concerned the scale of these new records could mark the start of an alarming trend. Others say record-breaking temperatures like these are always concerning but to be expected given the human-caused climate crisis. All agree the consequences are likely to be significant. Warmer oceans bleach coral, kill marine life, increase sea level rise and make the ocean less efficient at absorbing planet-warming pollution – the warmer oceans get, the more the planet will heat. One major driver of the heat is believed to be an approaching – and potentially strong – El Niño, a natural climate fluctuation associated with warming in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, which has a global heating effect. The world has just emerged from a 3-year La Niña, El Niño’s cooler counterpart, which has helped mask the full impact of global warming. Since La Niña ended in March, ocean temperatures seem to be on a rebound, scientists say. “It’s a little bit like we’ve had the freezer door open for a while and it’s helped to cool the planet,” Johnson said. But even while that freezer has been open, background temperatures have continued to rise. Now the freezer is closed, everything is hotter than before. The World Meteorological Organization said on Wednesday there is about an 80% chance El Niño will develop between July and September. But part of what has puzzled scientists is temperatures have risen so much before it has even arrived. Some are concerned this suggests climate change might be progressing in ways climate models have not predicted. “An El Niño event is brewing, but it’s probably too early to blame that as the cause,” professor Mike Meredith, science leader at the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN. “It’s vital that we find out what is causing [the peak in ocean surface temperature] though, and understand whether this is an isolated extreme high or the start of an even more worrying trend.” Surface temperatures tell one story about what’s happening to the world’s oceans. But to understand where the world is heading in the long term, it’s important to also look at the deeper ocean temperatures, said Sarah Purkey, an assistant professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Thousands of floats in the world’s oceans measure its heat content, analyzing temperature from the surface down to the deep waters, feeding back data. “Ocean heat content has been on a very steady, sometimes accelerating, rise,” Purkey told CNN, because of human-caused global warming. The oceans absorb around 90% of the excess heat the world produces, as well as around 25% of carbon pollution. In 2022, the oceans were the warmest on record for the fourth year in a row. A study published in April found the heat in the climate system was accelerating, spelling bad news for the oceans. It found the rate of change in how much heat the Earth has accumulated has more than doubled over the last two decades – and most of that is going into the ocean. “There’s a really urgent need to understand this because if it’s part of a long term trend, this is really highly concerning,” said Karina von Schuckmann, an oceanographer at Mercator Ocean International in France and a co-author on the study. One surprising reason could be the reduction of aerosols in the atmosphere. In 2020, regulations were introduced to limit the amount of sulfur in the fuel ships used – a policy aimed at addressing air pollution. Though air pollution has a significant impact on human health, it also acts as an artificial sunscreen and reflects sunlight away from the Earth. One theory is the absence of aerosols may have turned up the heat, von Schuckmann said. Whatever the reasons behind the increase in ocean heat, the impacts are potentially catastrophic if temperatures continue to head off the charts. The oceans shield us from the full impacts of the climate crisis. “We should thank the ocean for taking up most of what we’ve done to the climate system, otherwise we would be seeing effects that are really 100 times what we’re seeing right now,” Purkey said. But this buffering role comes at a high cost. Hotter oceans cause coral reef bleaching and are linked to toxic algae blooms, which can suck oxygen from the water and choke marine life, sometimes forcing fisheries to close. Warmer waters are also less effective at absorbing carbon, which means more is left in the atmosphere, which in turn fuels more global warming. Sea level rises as water warms – not only through the melting of ice sheets, but water also expands as it heats up. Surface warming supercharges cyclones and hurricanes. Scientists are particularly concerned about the impact of warming on meridional overturning currents, ocean “conveyor belts” that push surface water to the deeper ocean and play a key role in regulating the planet’s energy balance. “It’s probably the most important thing to monitor,” said Purkey. The strength of the currents will determine how efficient the ocean is at taking up the excess heat humans are producing, she said. And, for example, if the overturning current in the Atlantic Ocean weakens, or even collapses, the consequences could be dire – including very cold winters in Western Europe, rapid sea level rise and disruption to tropical monsoons. For now, ocean surface temperatures have started to fall, even if they remain high for this time of year. As scientists continue to analyze the reasons for record ocean warming, they are clear records will continue to be smashed as the climate crisis intensifies. “This is a bit of a wake-up call, I hope, for everybody globally that this trajectory of warming that we’re on is not going to stop until we bring our emissions right back down to zero,” England said."

","Ashley Strickland, CNN","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. A new mission designed to improve hurricane forecasting has launched, just ahead of the June 1 arrival of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. The NASA mission includes a constellation of CubeSats called TROPICS, or Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats. The first two CubeSats lifted off from Māhia, New Zealand, aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket at 9 p.m. ET on Sunday. The first mission was nicknamed “Rocket Like a Hurricane,” while two additional CubeSats, nicknamed “Coming to a Storm Near You,” will launch from the same location in about two weeks. Together, the four satellites, each weighing 12 pounds and about the size of a loaf of bread, will observe tropical cyclones from low-Earth orbit. Once all of them are in orbit, the tiny satellites will form a constellation that makes more frequent observations than current weather-monitoring satellites. “The need for improved climate and weather data from space is acute and growing. Hurricanes and tropical storms have a devastating effect on lives and livelihoods, so we’re immensely proud to be entrusted by NASA to launch the TROPICS missions which will enable scientists and researchers to accurately predict storm strength and give people time to evacuate and make plans,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck in a statement. “With the 2023 hurricane season fast approaching, time is of the essence for these missions.” Each CubeSat will orbit at about 340 miles (550 kilometers) above Earth’s surface and capture hourly observations of the precipitation, temperature and humidity of tropical storms. Current satellites take similar data, but only about every six hours, which makes it more difficult to measure the intensity of storms. More frequent data can help scientists understand the rapid changes that can occur within a storm, impacting its structure and stability, and help meteorologists improve their prediction and forecasting models. During the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, there were so many tropical storms and hurricanes that meteorologists ran out of names on the predefined list and had to switch to the Greek alphabet — and then the same thing happened again in 2021, said Ben Kim, program executive at NASA’s Earth Science Division. In 2022, three hurricanes hit the US, but Hurricane Ian alone caused more than $100 billion in damages and caused more than 100 fatalities, Kim said. “TROPICS aims to improve our scientific understanding by obtaining microwave observations that allow us to see the inner structure of the storm approximately hourly,” Kim said. “These observations will complement existing weather satellites and ultimately then can be tied to the broader understanding of the entire Earth system.” Data collected by TROPICS will be shared with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the National Hurricane Center and other partners. The satellites will measure water vapor primarily located in the troposphere, or the lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere, where most weather phenomena occurs. “The exciting thing about this is its the ability to see inside the storms, but it’s also the ability to see how the storms are changing over short periods of time,” said Dr. Will McCarty, program scientist at NASA’s Earth Science Division."

In mid-April, the northwest city of Tak became the first place in the country to top 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit), according to Herrera, using data from the Thai Meteorological Department. Last month, Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed concern over “dangerously high temperatures in various parts of Thailand.” April and May are typically the hottest months of the year for South and Southeast Asia as temperatures rise before annual monsoon rains bring some relief. Temperatures across the region are expected to return closer to average in the coming days, but unprecedented heat events are becoming more common as the climate crisis intensifies. A 2022 study determined that dangerous heat waves, at temperatures of 39.4 degrees Celsius (103 degrees Fahrenheit) and above, will occur between three and 10 times more often by the turn of the century. In the tropics, which encompasses much of Asia, the study found that days of “extremely dangerous heat” – defined as 51 degrees Celsius (124 Fahrenheit) – could double, putting the population of impacted countries at risk. “By definition, we don’t know what could happen if large populations are exposed to unprecedented heat and humidity stress,” the study’s lead author Lucas Vargas Zeppetello from Harvard University previously told CNN, “but heat waves in the past few decades have already been extremely deadly and there is serious cause for concern in the future.” CNN’s Robert Shackelford, Taylor Ward and Helen Regan contributed reporting."

Some isolated locations could get up to 5-7 inches around the heaviest downpours. Farther north, near Shreveport, the heaviest downpours will begin to move in later Wednesday. “Bottom line up front: A more significant rainfall event appears to be taking shape for later today and tonight,” the National Weather Service office in Shreveport said. “The flooding concerns have ratcheted up significantly over much the region.” Get your local forecast here The Ark-La-Tex region could see widespread rainfall amounts up to 3 inches, but isolated locations could pick up more than 5 inches. A Level 2 out of 4 slight risk of flash flooding expands north into Arkansas and includes Little Rock. In addition to the flash flooding, there is also a concern for severe storms. A few isolated tornadoes and damaging wind gusts will be a possibility as these storms meander to the north. The bulk of the storm activity should be wrapping up along the coast Wednesday evening and continue into Thursday morning for areas to the north. By Thursday evening, much of the flood potential will be over, with just lingering storms through the end of the week."

","Kathleen Magramo, CNN","Smoke from Australia’s worst wildfires in decades may have contributed to the rare triple La Niña weather event that impacted continents thousands of miles away, according to new research. Flames burned through 46 million acres from June 2019 to January 2020 – during Australia’s summer months – thrusting emissions into the Earth’s atmosphere and potentially shifting weather patterns, said a study published in Science Advances on Wednesday. The study, led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), said the disaster was “exceptional in both its severity and particulate emissions,” releasing smoke levels similar to a major volcanic eruption. Scientists John Fasullo, Nan Rosenbloom and Rebecca Buchholz from NCAR in the United States used new modeling to demonstrate how emissions from the bushfires may have shifted weather patterns. Their research suggests smoke emissions led to the formation of clouds over the southeastern Pacific Ocean, which absorbed radiation from the sun and cooled surface water temperatures. These disruptions may have helped trigger the rare three-year La Niña event, that brings wetter and cooler conditions to the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains of the US, especially during the winter, and drier and warmer conditions in the south. The recent La Niña event stretched from late 2020 to early 2023 – an unusually long period that created a series of devastating tropical cyclones and intense hurricanes in some places and exacerbated drought in others. Australia was also dragged to extremes, suffering historic rainfall and floods over that period. “Many people quickly forgot about the Australian fires, especially as the COVID pandemic exploded, but the Earth system has a long memory, and the impacts of the fires lingered for years,” said NCAR scientist Fasullo, lead author of the study. Scientists have previously established that large volcanic eruptions in the Southern Hemisphere can shift the odds toward the formation of La Niña. In such instances, smoke high in the atmosphere results in the formation of light-reflecting particles called aerosols, which can cool the climate and ultimately create favorable conditions for La Niña. This time researchers found that smoke aerosols from the unprecedented Australia wildfire season had brightened cloud decks, especially off the coast of Peru, which cooled and dried the air in the region. That ultimately shifted the zone where the northern and southern trade winds come together, cooling the Pacific Ocean and creating the perfect conditions for the La Niña formation. Although the emissions from the fires lingered in the atmosphere for several months, it triggered an even longer feedback loop that created successive La Niña weather patterns for years. “The results here suggest a potential connection between this emergence of cool conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the climate response to the Australian wildfire emissions,” the paper stated. Australian climate scientist Tom Mortlock, who was not involved in the study, said the research was “the first time a bushfire event has been widespread enough to have an impact in climate models,” and highlighted the “interconnectivity of the climate system.” The recent La Niña streak is also unusual because it is the only one that did not follow a strong El Niño – the opposite pattern of warming instead of cooling in the Tropical Pacific. This year, weather agencies are forecasting a more severe El Niño, exacerbated by warming global temperatures, which may bring impacts like extreme heat, dangerous tropical cyclones and a significant threat to fragile coral reefs."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/epa-power-plant-rules-climate/index.html,EPA proposes new rules that would dramatically slash planet-warming pollution from power plants,05/11/2023,                                                 The rules would apply to the nation’s fleet of existing and new power plants that run on coal and natural gas – two major fossil fuels that are the root cause of the climate crisis.                                             ,"Ella Nilsen, CNN","The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday proposed one of its most highly anticipated climate rules to date, compelling nearly all US power plants that generate the nation’s electricity to capture or otherwise slash their planet-warming fossil fuel emissions. The rules would apply to the nation’s fleet of existing and new power plants that run on coal and natural gas – two major fossil fuels, which are the root cause of the climate crisis. The Biden administration’s proposal would push utilities to outfit many power plants with costly carbon capture technology or add clean hydrogen fuel to reduce their emissions. Unlike the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which faced fierce opposition that rose to the Supreme Court, the proposed rules will leave it to individual utilities to choose how to meet the emissions standards – which will ultimately be implemented and enforced by individual states, EPA officials said. Some power plants that are slated to close in the next few years may not have to meet the new requirements. Between 2028 and 2042, the EPA estimated the rules would cut about 617 million metric tons of carbon pollution from existing coal and new gas plants. In addition, the agency estimates the rules will cut between 214 and 407 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from existing gas plants. EPA and White House officials said the proposed rules would help meet President Joe Biden’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, while only marginally raising costs for the nation’s ratepayers. EPA Administrator Michael Regan said his agency estimated that while baseline electricity costs would go up 2% by 2030, they would rise just 0.08% further by 2040. “We believe that where we will end up will be squarely in line with the president’s goal,” Regan told reporters. “We’re looking at a negligible impact on electricity prices, while yielding climate and public health benefits that far exceed those costs.” Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Biden said the new EPA rules proposal “kicks off a public commitment to engage with labor and industry and environmentalists and other experts to make sure we make a major step forward in the climate crisis, protecting public health.” Combined with a larger suite of regulations aimed at cutting pollution from oil and gas, vehicles, refrigerants, the new rules that the EPA has put forth in the past few years could save up to 15 billion metric tons of plant-warming pollution, Regan said. Much of that comes from the administration’s recent proposals to cut vehicle emissions, but the clean power plant rules are critical. The power sector makes up a quarter of overall US emissions, but it holds outsized importance since it will provide power for electric vehicles and help decarbonize heavy industry. “Getting carbon pollution out of the power sector is the lynchpin by which we tackle carbon pollution throughout the rest of the economy,” Sam Ricketts, a former adviser to Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee who now works with Evergreen Action and the Center for American Progress, told CNN. The rule will likely face new legal challenges and political headaches. But Regan said the new power plant rules “would bring us one step closer in our mission to safeguard the air our children breathe.” The Obama-era Clean Power Plan focused on getting power plants to change how they generated electricity, and ultimately was blocked by Supreme Court. But the Biden EPA’s proposal focuses on outfitting existing plants with technology to capture pollution before it escapes into the air, and it gives utilities the ability to choose how they meet the new standard. The agency is betting that much if this can be done through carbon capture and sequestration: catching carbon pollution at its source, after which it can be stored or reused. According to the EPA rules, carbon capture would be used for baseload power plants that generate a lot of electricity and expect to have a long life – operating after the year 2040. For plants that generate less electricity, or ones that are shutting down earlier, the rules would be different. For instance, some categories of plants could add clean hydrogen to the mix – starting at 30% clean hydrogen early in the 2030s and ramping up to over 90% clean hydrogen by the end of the decade. “Each power plant is going to have its own individual set of circumstances,” Jay Duffy, an attorney and expert on power plant emissions at nonpartisan group Clean Air Task Force, told CNN. “Some of them may already be old and marginal, and it might make more sense for them to not make some big pollution control investment later in their life.” Many of the proposed rules would go into effect years from now – a recognition from the EPA that much of this technology isn’t in wide use yet. Carbon capture has traditionally been quite expensive to add to power plants, causing some utilities to choose to shut plants down and replace them with cheaper, renewable energy like solar or wind.  However, the Inflation Reduction Act came with significant subsidies for carbon capture to make the technology cheaper and on par with other technologies that can cut emissions. “Essentially, the costs of (carbon capture) are minimal” and comparable to other technologies given the tax credits in the IRA, Duffy said. Still, a utility industry source said that even if IRA subsidies bring the costs down, there’s no escaping the fact that there’s little existing pipeline and storage infrastructure for captured carbon in the US. Clean hydrogen projects are similarly nascent, the source said. But others said the long timelines and some flexibility for industry in EPA’s proposed rule is a recognition of that. “They’re trying to phase it in over time,” Carrie Jenks, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental & Energy Law Program, told CNN. “I’m sure they’re considering the infrastructure that’s needed.” Regan told reporters that some plants would shut down, though didn’t offer a precise number. “The short answer is yes, we will see some retirements within the system,” Regan said. “But this is really a decision that will be made state by state, company by company.” The new EPA rules landed with immediate criticism from lawmakers and officials in a coal-heavy state. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia has already vowed to oppose any future EPA nominee in the Senate over the rule. Meanwhile, Manchin’s Republican colleague Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia called it an attempt to “kill American energy jobs” and vowed to introduce a Congressional Review Act bill to attempt to overturn it. And though the EPA’s regulatory ability survived one Supreme Court challenge last year, it could face new attempts to squash it. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey suggested the rules were headed for a court battle. “Based upon what we currently know about this proposal, it is not going to be upheld, and it just seems designed to scare more coal-fired power plants into retirement — the goal of the Biden administration,” Morrisey, a Republican, said in a statement. “That tactic is unacceptable, and this rule appears to utterly fly in the face of the rule of law. The U.S. Supreme Court has placed significant limits on what the EPA can do — we plan on ensuring that those limits are upheld, and we expect that we would once again prevail in court against this out-of-control agency.” Still, administration officials and advocates underscored they believed the rule comports with the Supreme Court’s recent decision in West Virginia v. EPA and is one that will survive future legal challenges. “I have confidence in its durability,” Ricketts said. “The EPA has learned the lessons. … I think they’re operating tightly in the bounds of what the Clean Air Act and Supreme Court allow.” While Duffy said it would be no surprise if the new rules were challenged in the courts, he added that he “wouldn’t expect this rule to present the same sort of big legal questions that the Supreme Court usually takes up.” Regan announced the new proposed rules on Thursday at the University of Maryland where he spoke directly to young voters about the Biden administration’s climate goals. The slate of EPA rules combating pollution, Regan said, made him “optimistic about what’s possible for the future of our nation.” This story has been updated with more information."

Concentrations of planet-warming carbon pollution in the air are at their highest level in more than 2 million years – and the world has yet to even hit peak fossil fuel emissions. The crisis is so urgent that scientists and governments are scrambling to find ways to remove some of this carbon pollution from the air, and to capture what’s still being produced by power plants and industrial facilities. Long considered controversial, these techniques are increasingly landing a starring role in climate policies. In its 2022 report, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that “all available studies require at least some kind of carbon dioxide removal to reach net zero” – where the world removes as much planet-heating pollution from the atmosphere as it emits. Even if emissions fall significantly, the world would still need to remove between around 10 to 20 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year, according to the IPCC. Very few people claim that carbon capture and removal alone will solve climate change. “There’s no silver bullet here,” said Howard Herzog, Senior Research Engineer in the MIT Energy Initiative, who has studied carbon capture for four decades. But it’s “a tool in our portfolio” of options, he told CNN. Others, however, fear that this is a reckless bet on technology that is expensive, unproven at scale and too far away from full development to provide a meaningful answer to the climate crisis. And they criticize these technologies as a dangerous distraction from policies to cut down fossil fuel use. “Carbon capture” is often used as catch-all term for what are actually two sets of technologies – carbon capture and carbon removal. But there are important differences. Carbon capture reduces the amount of carbon pollution that would otherwise go into the atmosphere by catching it at the source of pollution, then storing it or reusing it. It works like this: Instead of sending carbon pollution (or “flue gas”) from burning fossil fuels up a smokestack and into the atmosphere, it is trapped and put through a chemical process. The most common way to do that, said Herzog, is to put the flue gas into contact with a liquid solvent, which pulls the CO2 out in a process called chemical scrubbing. The CO2 is then compressed to knock out the water and sent by pipeline, or sometimes by ship, to a location where it can be reused or stored. For long-term storage, “really the only option is to put it deep underground,” Herzog said. This requires the right geological conditions. Sandstone, a porous rock, is particularly good, he said, and a layer of denser rock on top like shale will stop the carbon seeping through. The captured carbon can also be reused to make other products, such as chemicals, fuel and cement. But the climate benefit will depend on how long the carbon is trapped. Captured carbon used in carbonated drinks, for example, will just escape right back into the air. Another way captured carbon has been used, and one which has helped make this technology controversial, is in a process called “enhanced oil recovery.” The carbon is pushed into wells to to force out the hard-to-reach remnants of oil – allowing fossil fuel companies to squeeze more from aging oil fields. Carbon removal refers to a slew of different techniques which aim to remove carbon pollution that is already in the atmosphere and lock it up permanently. Trees and oceans are natural carbon sinks – they remove more carbon from the atmosphere than they contribute. “But as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, it is harder for nature to do its job,” Jan Mazurek, senior director of the carbon dioxide removal program at the non-profit ClimateWorks Foundation, told CNN. So, humans are trying to develop ways of speeding up carbon removal. Some techniques are low-tech, such as mass tree planting. Others seek to supercharge natural processes, like seeding the oceans with nutrients to increase the growth of carbon-storing marine life, or spreading crushed rock on land to cause chemical reactions that capture carbon from the air. “Biochar” involves burning wood, leaves and dead plants in a low oxygen environment to produce a form of charcoal, which can be added to soil like a fertilizer to increase crop growth. Other carbon removal technologies have similarities to parts of carbon capture. One, called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, involves planting trees or crops, which take up carbon from the air, and then burning them to produce energy. The carbon pollution created is trapped and stored by injecting it deep underground. Direct air capture, possibly the most high-profile carbon removal technique, uses machines to suck in air and then extracts the carbon using chemicals. This can then be injected deep underground or reused. Many of these technologies are at an early stage, remain prohibitively expensive and are a long way from being big enough to have a significant impact. Carbon removal technologies may need to be scaled up by a factor of 1,300 by 2050 to meet the Paris Climate Agreement pledge to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to a January report led by authors from the University of Oxford – and few countries have plans to do this. Roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide are currently removed globally every year and only a tiny fraction – 0.1% – comes from technologies such as direct air capture, the report found. There are 18 direct air capture plants operating globally, all small-scale. Together they remove around 10,000 tons of carbon a year, according to the International Energy Agency. The Orca plant, run by Swiss company Climeworks in Iceland, claims to be the world’s largest, with capacity to remove 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year. The difficulty is that, while the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising very quickly, it still makes up only about 0.04% of air. That makes removing carbon directly from the air significantly more energy-intensive and expensive than removing it from smokestacks, where carbon concentrations are far higher. When it comes to carbon capture and storage, there are approximately 35 commercial facilities in operation around the world, according to the International Energy Agency, capturing nearly 50 million tons of carbon a year. While there are hundreds of these facilities in development, even if all they all start operating, “deployment would remain substantially below what is required in the Net Zero Scenario,” said the IEA on its website. The Biden administration has provided incentives for carbon capture and removal under the Inflation Reduction Act, including through tax credits. In December, the US announced $3.7 billion to “kick start” a carbon capture and removal industry. “No matter how fast we decarbonize the nation’s economy, we must tackle the legacy pollution already in our atmosphere to avoid the worst effects of climate change,” US Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm said in a statement at the time. What’s still holding many of these technologies back is the economics, Herzog said. A coal plant without carbon capture, for example, is always going to be much cheaper to run than one with carbon capture, unless policy changes. Proposed regulations to cap the amounts of planet-heating pollution from US power plants could help. The new rules wouldn’t mandate carbon capture technology but would incentivize it. Other countries are doing more, Herzog said. “In Europe, the policies are becoming stronger and forcing industry to react.” The EU, which already has an emissions trading system putting a price of around $100 on each ton of carbon pollution, has set a target to store at least 55 million tons of CO2 annually by 2030. Every form of carbon removal or capture comes with questions and potential problems. There are concerns over the amount of land required for mass tree planting or for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and the possibility that could clash with land needed to grow food. Direct air capture remains very expensive, and despite big industry promises that costs will plummet as the technology develops, there’s a long way to go to see if this is plausible, Herzog said. This technology also requires huge amounts of clean energy to run, said Holly Buck, Assistant Professor of Environment and Sustainability at the University at Buffalo, adding to the demand as the world looks to electrify everything from cars to homes. “There’s going to be a lot of demand for this new renewable capacity. Policymakers have to be really smart about figuring out where that goes,” she told CNN. There are also concerns about the impacts of transporting and storing carbon, a key feature of carbon capture and several carbon removal techniques. Pipelines can leak, potentially contaminating drinking water and causing health problems. More than 40 people needed hospital treatment after a carbon pipeline leaked in Mississippi in 2020. “The pipeline needs to be built the right way, in the right places and well monitored,” Buck said. “That, I think, is one of the major challenges. It’s addressable, but it requires really good regulation and monitoring.” Perhaps one of the most persistent criticisms of these technologies is their potential to distract from policies to phase out fossil fuels and instead give polluters a license to keep polluting. In 2021, hundreds of organizations signed an open letter to President Joe Biden and top lawmakers in Congress, arguing that “technological carbon capture is a dangerous distraction.” “It is the fossil fuel industry’s excuse for inaction and delay,” Lili Fuhr, Director of the fossil economy program at the Center for International Environmental Law, told CNN. But others say it cannot be an either-or question. “We are now, unfortunately, at a point where we can’t leave any option off the table to avert dangerous warming,” Mazurek said. There are going to be industries, such as cement, that are all but impossible to decarbonize in the near-term, said Herzog. It’s here carbon capture and removal technologies will be needed. “That’s not a distraction,” he said, “That’s a solution where there’s no other solution.” Still, he added, “the best way to remove CO2 from the air is not to release it into the air in the first place.”"

","Laura He, CNN","China’s carbon emissions will likely hit a new record in 2023 on the back of an economic rebound, but a rapid expansion in green energy will enable its emissions to peak soon, a global energy think tank said on Friday. China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gas, saw its carbon dioxide emissions rise 4% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2022, reaching more than 3 billion tonnes, according to a new report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) for Carbon Brief. That’s the highest first-quarter number on record. The increase was driven by an economic rebound after the end of China’s zero-Covid policy, economic stimulus measures and weak hydro generation due to an ongoing drought, the Helsinki-based think tank said. “Looking at the rest of the year, the government’s focus on economic growth means that China’s emissions are likely to reach an all-time high in 2023, topping the previous peak in 2021,” said Lauri Myllyvirta and Qi Qin, analysts at CREA. However, the emissions could peak soon, as China has accelerated its clean energy push and installed record amounts of solar and wind power capacity, the analysts pointed out. “The rapid expansion in low-carbon energy, if sustained, could enable emissions to peak and enter structural decline, once the post-Covid recovery has played out,” they said. China’s economy rebounded in the first quarter of 2023, with GDP growth accelerating to 4.5%, according to official statistics released last month. The government previously set a growth target of “around 5%” for 2023, although many investment banks have raised their forecasts to above 5.5%. The largest contributor to rising emissions was electricity generation. Power output from coal increased by 2% from a year ago, the report showed. Coal is the main source of energy in China and is widely used for heating, power generation and steelmaking. The country has ramped up coal production since last summer when the worst heatwave and drought in decades hit hydroelectricity, the country’s second biggest source of power. Coal production surged 11% in 2022 from 2021, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. To boost coal imports, China scrapped its restrictions on Australian coal earlier this year, effectively ending an unofficial ban that lasted for more than two years. In the first quarter, China’s total imports of coal soared 96% from a year earlier. The second biggest reason for rising emissions was the higher production volumes of construction materials, mainly steel and cement, the CREA analysts said. That’s mainly because of government stimulus measures for the manufacturing and construction industries. “Emissions are likely to grow this year,” the analysts said, as the government is pursuing a broad-based approach to economic recovery that seeks to boost exports, manufacturing output and construction, in addition to consumption. This will lead to a sharp increase in bank lending and investment, particularly for manufacturing, transportation and energy production, they added. However, China still sees clean energy as its future. President Xi Jinping restated his vision for a “green” and “beautiful” China in February and called for an energy revolution to achieve carbon neutrality in the longer term. Solar installations increased to a record 34 gigawatts (GW) in the first three months of the year, nearly tripling the previous high of 13GW in the same period of 2022, according to latest figures released by the National Energy Administration. New wind power installations also reached a record high. The 10.4GW added in the three months to March 2023 was an increase of 32% over the period in 2022, the NEA figures showed. These sources of power, including renewables and nuclear, exceeded 50% of China’s installed power capacity in the first quarter, overtaking fossil fuel-based capacity for the first time in history, the CREA analysts said. “When low-carbon power growth matches — and then exceeds — the annual increase in electricity demand, the sector’s CO2 emissions will peak,” they said."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","As the US barrels into a high-stakes and consequential election cycle, US climate envoy and former Secretary of State John Kerry is confident of one thing: If a Republican is elected president, they won’t be able to reverse the Biden administration’s wins on climate change and clean energy. The economy has so drastically and fundamentally changed in the past several years, Kerry argued – spurred in large part by the Democrats’ climate and energy law passed last year – that the markets would reject a challenge to the nation’s clean energy trajectory. “I don’t think anybody elected president – Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative – could change what is happening today,” President Joe Biden’s top climate diplomat told CNN in a candid and wide-ranging interview in his State Department office. “The power of the marketplace is bigger than the presidency on (climate change) now,” Kerry said. “So much money has been invested in retooling and redirecting business strategies and investments.” Kerry has been pleasantly surprised at the pace that clean energy manufacturing, electric vehicle and battery factories are flocking to the US, and noted EU officials are “a little annoyed” about generous US clean energy subsidies drawing business away from them. “Our message to them is ‘do the same thing; let’s get going,’” Kerry told CNN. “We have made a giant leap forward.” The 79-year-old Kerry – who has served as Biden’s climate envoy long after Washington insiders assumed he would retire – is gearing up for his third international climate summit this November in Dubai. He speaks to Biden “when I need to talk to him” and described the president as “super seized” by international climate issues. Despite whispers of a possible retirement that started two years ago, he’s outlasted multiple staff members, visited Mexico, Brazil, Europe and Japan this year alone, and is showing few signs of slowing. Kerry and his team are actively working on an in-person meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua after Xie recently recovered from a serious illness for which he was hospitalized, Kerry said. There is still lots of unfinished business between the US and China, the world’s two largest emitters. “At some point, we’re going to travel over there and pick up where we left off,” Kerry said. Sitting behind his desk, Kerry ticked off three issues he hopes to resolve with China: the country implementing its plan to cut emissions of super-polluting methane, demonstrating it can move away from coal faster and working together on the issue of deforestation. “Those are the three things that are on the table as a result of the meetings that we had” last year, Kerry said. “Now, we’d like to go further, and we think there are things that we could cooperate on.” Kerry and Xie have known each other for 25 years, Kerry said. And their work together has been a relative bright spot amid a thorny US and China relationship. But the climate envoys haven’t been immune; China abruptly pulled out of ongoing climate talks last year after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan in the face of fierce objection from China. The two countries agreed to resume at COP27 in Egypt late last year, but Kerry got Covid at the conference, leaving little time for actual negotiation. China announced in 2021 that it would develop a plan to limit emissions of methane – an incredibly potent greenhouse gas that scientists have focused on in recent years as a critical climate issue. Kerry said he has seen China’s methane plan but told CNN he is not sure if they have updated or strengthened it since. “It’s very possible; they’ve been deploying a lot of renewables in the last six, seven months,” Kerry said. “I’m not sure whether their plans may have shifted, that’s part of what we need to talk about.” Though he was optimistic about cooperation with China, Kerry was blunt about the world’s chances to stave off the worst of the climate crisis. Nations are way off-track on their goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “No,” he told CNN. “Tragically, right now, not enough people are doing enough to achieve that goal.” Kerry said he was heartened to see some countries, including the US, making significant progress by moving to clean energy. But there are still too many that are moving slowly from fossil fuels – particularly the dirtiest one, coal. “What is not exciting is there’s too much coal use still and too much unabated fossil fuel emissions that are fouling the air,” Kerry said. “We need to move much faster to bring ourselves in alignment with the 1.5-degree goal.” Kerry noted India has set an aggressive target of adding 500 gigawatts of renewable energy to its grid, even as it remains highly dependent on coal. “That’s a huge goal,” Kerry said. “They’re pushing very hard to try to achieve that. We want to help them, bringing finance to the table or other things. And if they do that, they would be in alignment with 1.5 [degrees Celsius].” Kerry added that it is difficult for climate models to quantify how quickly progress is being made as the Inflation Reduction Act spurs private investment in clean energy, which he called a “monumental accomplishment.” “That’s one of the things I find really super encouraging,” Kerry said. “I don’t think any of us who are looking at these models have an ability to be able to define, with accuracy, what the impact is of all the investment, all the private sector decisions that get made. I truly believe that we’re in a better place than we’ve been in a number of years because of the changes that are taking place.” The Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into Kerry’s role in the administration, and the “nature” of his negotiations with China. Kerry told CNN he hopes his climate negotiations are not politicized. “This is not a partisan issue. This should have nothing to do with politics,” Kerry said. “We’re all looking for the best marketplace solutions, the best things that we can do to create jobs, accelerate the transition, increase the health and safety of Americans by cleaning up the air and getting rid of the pollution.” Kerry also said he has been in touch with House Republicans on climate proactively, meeting with the Conservative Climate Caucus, a group chaired by Rep. John Curtis of Utah. “I think we’re going to maybe get a smaller group together; we talked about getting together,” Kerry said. “I’m open to talking anytime.” Despite Biden’s significant climate wins in Congress, the president has taken a hit among young voters for approving the controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska earlier this year. While Kerry reiterated that the Biden administration was legally hamstrung by previously contracts with oil company ConocoPhillips, he encouraged youth activists and voters to look at the bigger picture of the administration’s climate progress. “Look at the difference between Donald Trump, if that’s the nominee, or any other Republican who haven’t stepped up in this issue, and what the Biden administration is doing,” Kerry said. “And don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” But the Vietnam veteran and former anti-war activist added he sympathized with young people and encouraged them to continue to speak up. “I understand the feelings people have about Willow; there is an appearance of a contradiction because you see some drilling possibilities even as you’re trying to move away from dependency on unabated fossil fuels,” Kerry said. “Wherever I go, I ask young people, ‘Look, let’s be more militant, all of us.’ We’ve got to go out and demand more, push for more, and don’t take ‘less-than’ for an answer.”"

Be cautious around these rivers and streams as they will be running high and fast, and will also be very cold,” the weather service office in Hanford warns. Overnight temperatures will also stay much warmer than normal, which won’t allow the body the relief it needs from the extreme heat. This could exacerbate heat illnesses for those without air conditioning. The heat will stretch as far north as Canada through the weekend as well. The Canadian weather agency, Environment Canada, has issued a special weather statement warning of the extreme temperatures for portions of British Columbia and Alberta. Temperatures will be running as much as 25 to 30 degrees above normal for some locations, reaching as high as the low 90s, which will make the ongoing wildfire problem even worse. Nearly 150 wildfires are burning across Canada, 82 of which are in Alberta. The province is getting off to one of its fastest starts to the wildfire season this year, with roughly 1.1 million acres already burned to date. “The last time Alberta had this fast of a start to the wildfire season was 2016,” Provincial Information Officer for Alberta Wildfire, Josée St-Onge, told CNN. By this date in 2016, 488 wildfires had burned more than 1.2 million acres. By comparison, so far this year we have seen 426 wildfires, which have burned nearly 1.1 million acres. The wildfire smoke now covers much of Canada and has even entered the Northeast US. Portions of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast are under air quality alerts, including Washington, DC and Philadelphia, as the smoke particles will be unhealthy for sensitive groups. May is a very busy month for wildfires across Canada, and the season typically continues through the summer. If the current pace continues in Alberta, 2023 could break into the top 5 years for acreage burned by next week, with still much of the fire season remaining. These are the five years with the most burned acreage in Alberta: This hot air is isolated in the West, as of now. Across the foothills and Rockies, temperatures will be quite different, running 15 to 25 degrees below normal."

","Julia Horowitz, CNN","Questions swirl about the strength of China’s recovery from Covid lockdowns, and there’s talk of recession in the United States. Yet Europe’s economic prospects have brightened in recent months, according to the European Commission. The EU’s executive arm on Monday upgraded its growth outlook for 2023 and 2024. It now expects the EU economy to expand 1% this year, up from an estimate of 0.8% in February. Growth next year is pegged at 1.7%, an upward revision of 0.1 percentage points. The improved forecast for Europe — which narrowly dodged a recession this winter — still represents a marked slowdown on last year, when the bloc’s economy grew 3.5%. But it reflects sharply lower energy prices, which are reducing costs for businesses and easing the strain on households. A strong job market and ongoing government stimulus are also providing a lift. Even so, the Commission acknowledged that higher borrowing costs aimed at taming rising prices will weigh on growth in the months to come. The European Central Bank raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, the smallest increase since it started hiking in July, but hinted at further rate hikes to come given stubbornly high inflation. “The key factors underpinning this forecast go in opposite directions: on the one hand, declining energy prices and a resilient labor market and, on the other hand, tightening financial conditions,” Paolo Gentiloni, the European Commission’s economy minister, said at a press conference. “Heightened risk perception” among banks after recent tumult in the sector is making it harder to access credit, while rising rates are eating into loan demand, Gentiloni noted. Significant divergence is also expected among countries in the European Union. Growth in Germany, the bloc’s biggest economy, is expected to slow sharply to 0.2% in 2023. Meanwhile, Italy’s output could increase by 1.2%, and Portugal’s economy could expand by 2.4%. Separately, industrial production data for Europe published Monday showed signs of weakness. Production fell 4.1% in March among the 20 countries that use the euro, worse than economists had expected. “With the tailwinds from lower energy prices and easing semiconductor shortages apparently exhausted and the economy struggling with tighter monetary policy, we expect industrial output to contract slightly over the rest of the year,” Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients."

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. The West has taken a dive straight into summer, with temperatures well above those normally seen even at the end of July. Record-breaking temperatures and a heat wave will continue to grip the entire region through much of this week. Yesterday, several locations across the Pacific Northwest broke daily high temperature records: “Today will be the 4th day in a row with highs in the 80s for Seattle,” the National Weather Service office in Seattle said. “This will tie the record for most consecutive days with highs 80 degrees plus in the month of May.” For reference, Seattle’s normal high at the end of July is around 79 degrees, so temperatures are well above even the normal highs seen in the dog days of summer. Many people in the Pacific Northwest do not have air conditioning, and with overnight lows running warm as well, the body is not able to easily recover from the daytime heat. It has prompted heat alerts for more than 10 million people across the Pacific Northwest and portions of Central California. The weather setup very much resembles a weather pattern seen in the middle of summer for the region. A big dome of high pressure is sitting over the Northwest, allowing dry, downslope winds to come off the mountains, spiking temperatures well above average. As the heat continues to build this week, nearly 150 high temperature records will be in jeopardy across the West. While the heat will spread farther east throughout the week to include the Rockies and central and southern Plains, the most dramatic heat will be in the West. Temperatures are running 20 to 30 degrees above normal across the Pacific Northwest. “To put it in perspective, highs will be near record values each day,” the weather service in Boise, Idaho, said. “These hot temperatures will increase snowmelt in the mountains. Mainstream rivers fed by snowpack will be running high, swift and cold.” Weather service offices all across the West are urging people to stay out of the water and find relief from the heat in other ways. Water temperatures are in the 50s for the most part, cold enough to cause cold water shock and hyperthermia. This heat is not just affecting the US. It has been even more extreme across western portions of Canada. Several cities across British Columbia set new monthly records Sunday, including Lytton, which topped out around 97 degrees; hotter than the average temperature Phoenix, Arizona, experiences around this time of year. Environment Canada has issued heat warnings for northern portions of Alberta and portions of British Columbia, where high temperatures are forecast to reach the mid 80s. Temperatures here are running 15 to 25 degrees above normal, so the weather agency is urging people to cancel outdoor plans if they aren’t necessary, as heat-related illnesses are possible. One bit of good news is, “While the developing heat may result in daily temperature records being broken, it must be emphasized that the expected hot conditions will not approach those reached during the ‘Heat Dome’ of late June 2021,” Environment Canada said. The heat is also having a huge effect on Canada’s active start to the fire season. There are currently 89 fires burning in Alberta alone, where fires have scorched 1.3 million acres so far this year. It puts 2023 as the fifth-busiest fire season on record in Alberta, and we still have several months of fire season yet to go. While the hottest temperatures may have peaked over the weekend, the long-range outlook looks to remain quite warm for the Northwest. The Climate Prediction Center has the Northwest above normal as far as temperatures go through the next two weeks at least. While it doesn’t mean temperatures will be as extreme as they currently are, the trend is definitely on the warmer side. CNN Meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this story."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Millions of acres scorched by wildfires in the Western US and Canada — an area roughly the size of South Carolina — can be traced back to carbon pollution from the world’s largest fossil fuel and cement companies, scientists reported Tuesday. The study by the Union of Concerned Scientists, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, found that 37% of the area burned by wildfires in the West since 1986 — nearly 19.8 million acres out of 53 million — can be blamed on the planet-cooking pollution from 88 of the world’s major fossil fuel producers and cement manufacturers, the latter of which have been shown to produce around 7% of all carbon dioxide emissions. The amalgam of megadrought and record-breaking heat that’s drying out vegetation due to climate change has stoked the West’s wildfires. And researchers found that since 1901, the fossil fuel activities of these companies, including ExxonMobil and BP, among others, warmed the planet by 0.5 degrees Celsius — nearly half of the global increase during that period. Carly Phillips, a research scientist with the Science Hub for Climate Litigation at the Union of Concerned Scientists and co-author on the study, said the findings add to a significant library of research that directly links climate change or the impacts of the crisis to burning fossil fuel. “We know that many of these companies have known for decades about the consequences of climate change,” Phillips told CNN, referring to several studies and award-winning reports that have shown fossil fuel executives knew of but downplayed the growing threat. “But instead of sharing that information with the public, they engaged in this deliberate misinformation campaign to deceive the general public and cast doubt on climate science.” Fossil fuel companies have denied the conclusions of those reports. “The clear agenda of this group aside, America’s oil and natural gas industry is focused on delivering affordable, reliable energy while reducing emissions,” Christina Noel, a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry in the US, told CNN in an email. BP and Exxon have announced goals to achieve net-zero emissions in its operations by 2050. CNN reached out to BP and ExxonMobil about Tuesday’s study, but did not hear back in time for publication. The study comes as firefighters in Alberta, Canada, fight dozens of wildfires in the forest protection area of the province — fires that are being exacerbated by a dangerous heat wave with record-breaking temperatures in Western Canada and the US Pacific Northwest. Researchers behind the study came to their conclusions using a method that scientists have relied on in recent years to quantify how much of a role the climate crisis is playing in extreme weather and environmental disasters: They took actual climate data and compare it to an idealized, modeled version of the world where there was no fossil fuel pollution from the 88 companies. One metric they focused on was the region’s so-called vapor pressure deficit — or how thirsty the atmosphere is for moisture.  It is a key indicator of fire danger and drought, Phillips said, and measures how much the air is sucking moisture out of soil and plants, which then ultimately become fuel for wildfires. The methodology is “simple,” said Caroline Juang, researcher with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. “The study takes what we know about the strong relationship between climate and burned area, and extends this understanding to the role of big fossil fuel emitters,” Juang, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. “The authors use how global mean temperatures scales with [vapor pressure deficit] and then looks at how changes in [vapor pressure deficit] will change burned areas.” The researchers also accounted for aerosol pollution, which unlike planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide or methane, reflects sunlight back to space and has a cooling effect. Major oil and gas companies contribute roughly two-thirds of total industrial aerosol emissions, according to the study, which used fossil fuel emissions data through 2015, the latest available, and held figures constant from 2015 to 2021. Jatan Buch, a postdoctoral research scientist in the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, who was also not involved with the study, said that while vapor pressure deficit is the leading driver of year-to-year variability in burned area across the region, other factors play a role and should be examined in future studies. According to the study, those include precipitation and snowpack conditions and prescribed burns and fire suppression efforts that have led to a buildup of vegetation that help fuel fires. The report also noted that development and growth contributed to a higher risk of human behavior-caused fires, with more people and property in harm’s way. In recent years, fires have exhibited increasingly explosive behavior — leading to larger burned areas, more aggressive nighttime fires and even massive fire-induced tornadoes like in the Carr Fire in California in 2018. The largest fires are also pouring smoke into the atmosphere, which can be transported large distances, impacting millions with poor air quality potentially hundreds of miles away. “Even if you’re not living near the fire, you can still feel those impacts,” Phillips said. “What public health experts share is that there’s no amount of exposure to wildfire smoke that’s safe.” Climate scientists have said human-caused climate change plays a key role in making these extreme fire events worse and more likely to happen. Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, said that’s why this study is so important. “It shows how quickly the science about climate change causes is moving and gives us vital information about the very real harms to people from pollution from burning coal, oil and gas,” Marlon, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. “The failure of fossil fuel companies to abate their emissions after recognizing the climate risk of their activities in the mid-1960s is even more reprehensible,” Buch told CNN. “The continued greenhouse gas emissions due to these companies’ products in the late 20th century resulted in loading the dice for the western US climate toward a hotter and drier future with a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires.” Phillips said the key message they want people to take away from this study is that fossil fuel companies need to be held accountable for exacerbating extreme climate events like wildfires, which are putting lives at risk. “It didn’t have to be this way,” she said. They “should pay their fair share of the costs of these climate impacts.”"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Countries could slash plastic pollution by 80% in less than two decades, according to a new report from the United Nations Environment Programme. Plastic pollution is a scourge that affects every part of the world, from the Arctic, to the oceans and the air we breathe. It’s even changing ecosystems. Scientists recently found rocks made from plastic on a remote Brazilian island, and there is now so much plastic swirling in parts of the Pacific Ocean that communities of coastal creatures are thriving on it, thousands of miles from their home. The last few decades have seen plastic production levels soar, especially single-use plastic, and waste management systems have not kept pace. The world generated 139 million metric tons of single use plastic waste in 2021. Global production of plastic is set to triple by 2060 if no action is taken. UNEP’s report aims to offer a roadmap to governments and businesses to dramatically cut levels of plastic pollution. It focuses on three main strategies: reuse, recycling and alternative materials. Reusing plastics would have the greatest impact, according to the report, which recommends promoting options such as refillable bottles, deposit programs to incentivize people to return plastic products and packaging take-back programs. This would be the most “powerful market shift,” reducing plastic pollution by 30% by 2040, the report said. Scaling up recycling levels could reduce plastic pollution by a further 20%, according to the report. Only around 9% of plastics are recycled globally each year, with the rest ending up in landfill or incinerated. The report also recommends discontinuing the fossil fuel subsidies that help make new plastic products cheaper, which disincentivizes recycling and the use of alternative materials. Fossil fuels are the raw ingredient for almost all plastics. The use of appropriate alternative materials for single-use products, such as wrappers and sachets – including switching to compostable materials that more easily break down – could reduce plastic pollution by 17%, the report found. “The way we produce, use and dispose of plastics is polluting ecosystems, creating risks for human health and destabilizing the climate,” said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director, in a statement. “This UNEP report lays out a roadmap to dramatically reduce these risks through adopting a circular approach that keeps plastics out of ecosystems, out of our bodies and in the economy.” The report estimates the investment needed for the changes it recommends will cost around $65 billion a year, but says this amount is far outweighed by the costs of doing nothing. Moving to an economy where plastic is reused and recycled could bring $3.25 trillion in savings by 2040, according to the report, by avoiding the negative impacts of plastic, including those on climate, health, air and water. Cutting plastics by 80% would save 0.5 billion tons of planet-warming carbon pollution a year, the report estimated. It could also create 700,000 new jobs, mostly in developing countries. Even with all these shifts, however, the world will still have to manage around 100 million metric tons of plastic waste from short-lived products by 2040, according to the report. That’s equivalent in weight to almost 5 million shipping containers – spread end to end, these could reach from New York City to Sydney, Australia and back again. Tackling this will require stricter standards for non-recyclable waste and increasing the responsibility of manufacturers for the impacts of their plastic products, according to the report. The report comes as countries prepare for a second round of negotiations in Paris later this month aimed at agreeing a world-first international plastics treaty, which would address the whole life of plastics from production to disposal. Whether the treaty will include curbs on plastic manufacturing remains a sticking point."

But with a warming planet and rising sea levels, countless ancestral homes, biodiverse ecosystems, and traditional ways of life are increasingly becoming more endangered. “The single greatest threat to our very existence is climate change,” said former Fijian Defense Minister Inia Seruiratu in 2022. “It threatens our very hopes and dreams of prosperity.” At least five islands have already been lost to the sea. Some Pacific Islanders have had to leave as climate refugees. But for the communities that remain, many organizations are helping to advance climate justice, sustainability, and conservation on the frontlines of the crisis. Global Greengrants Fund issues hundreds of grants every year to grassroots environmentalists around the world, including across the Pacific Islands. Founded in 1993, the non-profit connects resources with local leaders to promote environmentalism, natural resource protection, and indigenous communities. Funded projects in the region include restoring fresh water access in rural Micronesia, reviving endangered mangrove forests in Papua New Guinea, and rebuilding parts of Vanuatu after Cyclone Pam. For more than 25 years, Malama Kai Foundation has protected Hawaiian marine and coastal resources. Headquartered on the Big Island, the non-profit partners with government agencies, businesses, academia, and other conservation groups with initiatives like keeping coral reefs safe from anchor damage by boats. The foundation also runs a hands-on education program to teach about sustainability. MarAlliance works in tropical seas around the world, including the Federated States of Micronesia in the western Pacific. The organization researches threatened marine wildlife to promote habitat conservation. Projects in the region include studying the impact of sharks on local fisheries and the behavior of coastal manta rays. The organization also created a market for sustainably sourced seafood. Te Mana O Te Moana cares for sea turtles in French Polynesia, rehabilitating sick and wounded animals, monitoring nesting sites, and collecting data. At their care facility that’s open to the public, the non-profit reports more than half of the turtles they help arrive injured, usually at the hands of humans from things like speargun fishing or fishing nets. Launched in 2004, the organization also operates educational programs and advocates for the Polynesian marine environment. Founded in 1961, the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) is one of the largest and oldest conservation organizations in the world. With offices in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and Fiji, WWF’s work in the Pacific aims to protect the region’s “exceptionally rich marine biodiversity” and the culture and heritage of island communities. WWF Pacific programs include tackling climate change; protecting turtles, whales, sharks, and other sea life; promoting sustainable offshore fisheries; and helping tourism in the region become more energy efficient."

","Laura Paddison and Jessie Gretener, CNN","The world is now likely to breach a key climate threshold for the first time within the next five years, according to the World Meteorological Organization, due to a combination of heat-trapping pollution and a looming El Niño. Global temperatures have soared in recent years as the world continues to burn planet-warming fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. And that trend shows no sign of slowing. In its annual climate update, the WMO said that between 2023 and 2027, there is now a 66% chance that the planet’s temperature will climb above 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels for at least one year. As temperatures surge, there is also a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years – and the five-year period as a whole – will be the warmest on record for the planet, the WMO reported. Breaching the 1.5-degree threshold may only be temporary, the WMO said, but it would be the clearest signal yet of how quickly climate change is accelerating – hastening sea level rise, more extreme weather and the demise of vital ecosystems. Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees – compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically. “This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years. However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas, in a statement. The temperature increases are fueled by the rise of planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels, as well as the predicted arrival of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon with a global heating effect. “A warming El Niño is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory,” Taalas said. “This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment. We need to be prepared.” The current hottest year on record is 2016, which followed a very strong El Niño event. El Niño tends to ramp up the temperatures the year after it develops, which could put 2024 on track to be the hottest year on record. The world has already seen around 1.2 degrees of warming, as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and produce planet-heating pollution. And despite three years of cooling La Niña, temperatures have soared to dangerous levels. The last eight years were the warmest on record. The report stated that the chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius has risen steadily since 2015, when the WMO put the chance of breaching this threshold at close to zero. The annual mean global near-surface temperature for each year between 2023 and 2027 is predicted to be between 1.1 degrees Celsius and 1.8 degree Celsius higher than the 1850-1900 average, said the WMO. That refers to the period before the sharp increase of planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels. “Global mean temperatures are predicted to continue increasing, moving us away further and further away from the climate we are used to,” said Leon Hermanson,  a Met Office expert scientist who led the report, in a statement. Scientists have long warned that the world needs to stay within 1.5 degrees of warming to avoid catastrophic and potentially irreversible changes. Warming above this point increases the risk of triggering major tipping points, including the death of coral reefs and the melting of polar ice sheets, which will add to sea level rise, devastating coastal communities. In the US alone, 13 million people could be forced to relocate because of sea level rise by the end of the century. For many low-lying Pacific Island nations, warming over 1.5 degrees is a threat to their survival. Temperature rises also increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including droughts, storms, wildfires and heatwaves. Already this year a slew of temperature records have been broken – and in some cases smashed – across the world. In March, parts of Argentina grappled with temperatures up to 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal. High temperature records were smashed across large parts of Asia in April, while record-breaking temperatures scorched locations in the Pacific Northwest in May. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees could reduce the number of people exposed to extreme heatwaves by around 420 million, according to NASA. The 1.5 threshold may be important, but it’s not a tipping point in itself. With every fraction of a degree the world warms, the worse the effects will be. But, that also means every fraction of a degree by which warming can be reduced, will help. Scientists say that, while the window to act is fact closing, there is still time to reduce global warming by moving away from burning oil, coal and gas and toward clean energy. Many have also called for adaptation measures to prepare for the climate impacts that are already baked in, such as vast coastal walls to protect communities from sea level rise. Countries will meet at the UN COP28 climate summit in Dubai at the end of the year, where they will undertake a “global stocktake” – an assessment of their progress toward targets agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement. They are expected to be a long way off track on meeting goals to keep within 1.5 degrees of warming by cutting planet-heating pollution by more than 40% by 2030."

","Sharon Braithwaite and Sana Noor Haq, CNN","Deadly floods that have engulfed the northern Italian region of Emilia Romagna, killing at least 14 people, are another sign of the accelerating climate crisis, according to researchers. The floods come after years of severe drought in the region, which has compacted the soil, reducing its ability to abemsorb rainfall. “Rising temperatures intensify drought episodes, drying up the soil and changing its permeability in different ways,” Mauro Rossi, a researcher at the Research Institute for Geo-Hydrological Protection, part of the Italian National Research Council, said on Wednesday n a press release. Extreme amounts of water falling over a short period of time exacerbate runoff, Rossi said, causing excess water to drain toward the rivers, which respond by “overflowing, burrowing and changing their riverbeds.” More than 20 rivers in the region have burst their banks, prompting a wave of 280 landslides, the Civil Protection department said Thursday. Among those killed was an 84-year-old man, whose body was found in the mud in the courtyard of his house in the town of Faenza. Further east, in the village of Ronta di Cesena, a married couple also died. Up to 20,000 people have been forced to leave their homes and as many as 27,000 have been left without power, according to Enel, the Italian multinational manufacturer and distributor of electricity and gas. The floods have also devastated farmland. According to Coldiretti, a farmers association, more than 5,000 farms were under water in Emilia Romagna, which includes an area known as “Fruit Valley,” as well as corn and grain fields. Greenhouses and stables have also been flooded, with reports of drowned animals, Coldiretti said Thursday in a press release. Stefano Bonaccini, the president of Emilia Romagna, described the scale of the destruction as a “new earthquake,” just days before the anniversary of the earthquake that ripped through the region in 2012, killing 28 people. “We have rebuilt almost everything, but today we are facing another earthquake,”  Bonaccini said at a press conference on Thursday. “We must have strength,” he said, adding that the government needed to implement “urgent and extraordinary measures.” Relief operations are ongoing, with 1,097 firefighters deployed in the region, according to authorities Some Italian environmentalists have criticized the government for a lack of preparedness. The climate crisis “is affecting territories with increasingly intense extreme events, with risks to people’s lives, and impacts on the environment and the economy. And Italy once again proves unprepared,” Italian environmentalist association Legambiente said Thursday in a press release. While it’s too soon to know for certain what role climate change played in the floods, scientists say that, as levels of planet-heating pollution increase, the world can expect more frequent and more severe extreme weather. Italy is particularly vulnerable to climate change due to its geography, which puts it at high risk of landslides, and because it is surrounded by the warming Mediterranean Sea, increasing the chance of strong storms. Federico Spadini, a spokesman for Greenpeace Italy’s climate campaign, said extreme weather events “risk becoming the norm if we do not urgently address the causes of the climate crisis.” “We are not facing simple episodes of bad weather, but real tragedies fueled by global warming that have clear perpetrators. Continuing to extract and burn gas and oil is a crime that will increasingly aggravate the climate emergency, with loss of life, environmental destruction, and serious economic and social impacts,” Spadini added. CNN’s Niamh Kennedy and Barbie Latza Nadeau contributed reporting."

The potentially dangerous air has a far-off source: the wildfires raging in Canada.                                             ,"Haley Brink, Allison Chinchar and Zoe Sottile, CNN","Residents of the central United States experienced poor air quality and smoke over the weekend. The potentially dangerous air has a far-off source: the wildfires raging in Canada. The fires have ravaged western Canada, with more than 10,500 people evacuated from communities across Alberta. The effects of the fires extend far beyond Canada, with poor air quality emerging in states as far away as Missouri and New York. Here’s what you need to know about how the smoke may continue to affect parts of the US. While all fires produce smoke, the bigger the fire, the more smoke it can produce. As this spring’s Canadian wildfires burn bigger and hotter, the heat from the fire causes the smoke to travel farther up in the atmosphere, where it gets picked up by winds and weather patterns. The higher in the atmosphere the smoke rises, the farther the smoke can spread. The winds in the upper levels of the atmosphere can spread smoke hundreds or even thousands of miles away, which can lead to hazy skies and poor air quality in cities far away from where the fires are occurring. Wildfire smoke was measured to rise as high as 1 to 2 miles above the surface during the 2018 Camp Fire in California, according to NASA. As the smoke moves away from its heat source, the air will eventually cool and the smoke can sink, keeping it in the troposphere, the layer of the atmosphere closest to the surface of the Earth. The troposphere is where the daily weather we typically experience occurs. High and low pressure systems can cause all sorts of weather from strong winds, to thunderstorms, hail and snow. The troposphere can extend 4 to 12 miles above the Earth’s surface, according to the National Weather Service. Several states, including Nebraska, Washington, Montana and Wisconsin, announced air quality alerts early Friday. The National Weather Service in Omaha tweeted the smoke would continue to create red-colored sunsets and sunrises. The service in Tacoma reported the smoke would be “pushed eastward in time for the weekend.” As of Sunday afternoon, the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Quality Index reported “unhealthy” levels of air quality in parts of Montana and North and South Dakota. On Sunday morning, the National Weather Service office in Grand Forks, North Dakota confirmed “high level smoke” would continue throughout the day. Similarly, the weather service in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, reported “thick smoke well above the surface layer” would move into the area on Sunday. Poor air quality caused by the smoke would mostly affect those “that are particularly sensitive to particle pollution,” they said. Smoke from wildfires can affect the health of people living far from where the fires themselves ignited. A 2021 study conducted by epidemiologists from Colorado State University found long-term exposure to wildfire smoke leads to roughly 6,300 additional deaths each year, with the highest numbers found in the most populous states. Wildfire smoke carries fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, a tiny but dangerous pollutant, as CNN previously reported. When inhaled, the particulate matter travels deep into lung tissue, where it can enter the bloodstream. PM 2.5, which comes from sources such as smoke, fossil fuel plants and cars is linked to a number of health complications including asthma, heart disease, chronic bronchitis and other respiratory illnesses. CNN’s Melissa Alonso, Michelle Watson, and Rachel Ramirez contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","The global loss of wildlife is “significantly more alarming” than previously thought, according to a new study that found almost half the planet’s species are experiencing rapid population declines. Humans have already wiped out huge numbers of species and pushed many more to the brink – with some scientists saying we are entering a “sixth mass extinction” event, this time driven by humans. The main factor is the destruction of wild landscapes to make way for farms, towns, cities and roads, but climate change is also an important driver of species decline and is predicted to have an increasingly worse impact as the world warms. The study’s authors analyzed more than 70,000 species across the globe – spanning mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects – to determine whether their populations have been growing, shrinking or remaining steady over time. They found 48% of these species are declining in population size, with fewer than 3% seeing increases, according to the study published Monday in the journal Biological Reviews. Co-author Daniel Pincheira-Donoso, from the School of Biological Sciences at Queen’s University Belfast, said their findings are a “drastic alert.” “Other studies, based on considerably smaller numbers of species, have shown that the ongoing ‘extinction crisis’ is more severe than generally appreciated,” he told CNN. “Our findings provide a stark confirmation on a global scale.” The study provides a “clearer picture” about the extent of the global erosion of biodiversity, he added. For decades, the extinction crisis has been defined by “conservation categories” – labels that the International Union for Conservation of Nature assigns to each species they assess at a given moment in time, Pincheira-Donoso said. Based on that method, the IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species classifies about 28% of species as under threat of extinction. “What our study shows is not whether species are currently classed as threatened or not, but instead, whether their population sizes are becoming rapidly and progressively smaller or not,” Pincheira-Donoso said. Downward trends in population over time are a precursor to extinctions. According to this assessment, 33% of the species currently classed as “non-threatened” on the IUCN Red List are in fact declining towards extinction. Mammals, birds and insects are all seeing species declines, but amphibians have been particularly badly affected overall, the report found, and are facing a multitude of threats, including disease and climate change. It was better news for fish and reptiles, with more species appearing to have stable, rather than declining, populations. Geographically, declines tend to be concentrated in the tropics, the report found. One reason for that is that “animals in the tropics are more sensitive to rapid changes in their environmental temperatures,” Pincheira-Donoso said. “While we agree with the sentiments and concerns about the declines in species that this paper expresses (as it is fundamentally an analysis of IUCN Red List data), we think that the results over-inflate the situation,” said Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN Red List. Using population data across a wide range of animal groups, including those where data is lacking, is a less robust measure than the IUCN’s Red List criteria “which look at the trends of species over much longer time frames,” he told CNN. But Brendan Godley, a professor of conservation science at the University of Exeter who was not involved in the study, said the research offers novel insights into population trends. “This is an extremely impactful study, spanning the globe and all vertebrate groups and insects,” Godley told CNN. “By painstakingly combining population trajectories, rather than more limited Red List Assessments, it underlines how much pressure wildlife is under from human influence, and how this is global and across the animal groups,” he said. There are positive stories of animals being brought back from the brink of extinction, he said, including great whales and sea turtles. But, Godley added, “we should all be very alarmed about these results.” “Without thriving populations, species, habitats and ecosystems, we cannot persist,” he said."

","Tara Subramaniam, CNN","If the current pace of global warming goes unchecked, it will push billions of people outside the “climate niche,” the temperatures where humans can flourish, and expose them to dangerously hot conditions, according to a new study published Monday. The study, published in the journal Nature Sustainability, evaluated the impact on humans if the world continues on its projected trajectory and warms 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Factoring in both the expected global warming and population growth, the study found that by 2030 around two billion people will be outside the climate niche, facing average temperatures of 29 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher, with around 3.7 billion living outside the niche by 2090. Timothy Lenton, one of the study’s two lead authors, said that one third of the global population could find themselves living in climate conditions that don’t support “human flourishing.” “That’s a profound reshaping of the habitability of the surface of the planet and it could lead potentially to large scale reorganization of where people live,” Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, said in a video shared by the institute. According to the report, the niche consists of places where the annual average temperature spans from 13 degrees Celsius (55 degrees Fahrenheit) to around 27 degrees Celsius (81 degrees Celsius). Outside this window, conditions tend to be too hot, too cold or too dry. The study determined that while less than 1% of the global population is currently exposed to dangerous heat, with average temperatures of 29 degrees Celsius or higher, climate change has already put more than 600 million people outside the niche. “Most of these people lived near the cooler 13 degree Celsius peak of the niche and are now in the ‘middle ground’ between the two peaks. While not dangerously hot, these conditions tend to be much drier and have not historically supported dense human populations,” said study co-author Chi Xu, a professor at Nanjing University. If the Earth warms 2.7 degrees Celsius, India, Nigeria, Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan would be the top five countries with the most population exposed to dangerous heat levels, the study found. The entire population of some countries, such as Burkina Faso and Mali, as well as small islands already at risk from rising sea levels, would face unprecedented high temperatures. In the worst case scenarios, if the Earth warms up by 3.6 or even 4.4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, half of the world’s population would be outside the climate niche, constituting what the report calls “an existential risk.” According to the report, living outside the niche could lead to increased mortality rates, as exposure to temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius could be lethal, especially if humidity is so high the body can no longer cool itself to a temperature that can maintain normal functions. Extreme heat is also predicted to decrease crop yields, and increase conflict and the spread of disease. Scientists have long warned that warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius would result in catastrophic and potentially irreversible changes. As the areas within the climate niche shrink as global temperatures rise, a larger swath of the population will also be more frequently exposed to extreme weather events including droughts, storms, wildfires and heatwaves. Experts say there is still time to slow the pace of global warming by moving away from burning oil, coal and gas and toward clean energy, but the window is closing. Every fraction of a degree will make a difference, Lenton said. “For every 0.1 degrees Celsius of warming above present levels, about 140 million more people will be exposed to dangerous heat.” Earlier this month, the World Meteorological Organization announced that within the next five years, there is a 66% chance that the planet’s temperature will be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels for at least one year. “We’ve left it so late to tackle climate change properly that we’re now at a point that to achieve the rate of change we need, means something like a five times speeding up of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions or the decarbonization of the global economy,” Lenton said."

",Reuters,"Investment in clean energy will extend its lead over spending on fossil fuels in 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said Thursday, with solar projects expected to outpace outlays on oil production for the first time. Annual investment in renewable energy was up by nearly a quarter since 2021, compared with a 15% rise for fossil fuels, the Paris-based energy watchdog said in its World Energy Investment report. However, fossil fuel investment is still double the level it needs to fall to if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. “Clean energy is moving fast — faster than many people realize,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. “For every dollar invested in fossil fuels, about 1.7 dollars are now going into clean energy. Five years ago, this ratio was one-to-one.” Around $2.8 trillion is set to be invested in energy worldwide in 2023, of which more than $1.7 trillion is expected to go to renewables, nuclear power, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency improvements. The rest will go to oil, gas and coal. In 2023, solar power spending is due to hit more than $1 billion a day or around $380 billion on a yearly basis. “This crowns solar as a true energy superpower. It is emerging as the biggest tool we have for rapid decarbonization of the entire economy,” Dave Jones, head of data insights at energy think tank Ember, said in a statement. Investment in new fossil fuel supply will rise by 6% in 2023 to $950 billion, the IEA added. The agency did not expressly reiterate its blockbuster projection from 2021 that investors should not fund new oil, gas and coal supply projects if the world wants to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. Producer group OPEC has said calls by the IEA to stop investing in oil undermine global energy security and economic growth. Scientists and international climate activists have warned that the fossil fuel industry exacerbates the catastrophic impacts of climate change."

","Mia Alberti, CNN","The United Nations has chosen Brazil to host the international climate meeting, COP30, in the Amazonian city of Belém do Pará in 2025, the country’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced on Friday. “I’ve participated in COPs in Egypt, Paris, Copenhagen and all people talk about is the Amazon. So why not have the COP in the Amazon so [people] can get to know the Amazon, see its rivers, its forests, its fauna,” Lula said in a video posted on Twitter. Foreign Affairs Minister, Mauro Vieira, said the UN approved Brazil’s bid to host COP30 on May 18 after Lula’s request during last year’s COP27 meeting in Egypt. Belém do Pará is a northern Brazilian city located in the fringes of the Amazon forest. It’s the capital city of the state of Pará located on the coast of the Amazon river estuary. The governor of Pará, Helder Barbalho, said in the same video that it is a “great privilege for the whole country” to host the event, saying it “increases the responsibility” of Brazil’s climate agenda regarding the rights of indigenous people and the environment. Lula has promised to tackle Amazon deforestation and repair the damage to the Amazon caused by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, under whose presidency deforestation surged. But Lula’s government has come under fire for seemingly backtracking on its climate-related electoral promises in recent days. His administration helped Congress pass a draft law that strips the environment and indigenous people ministries of some powers, weakening their oversight of environmental protections and the demarcation of indigenous lands in the Amazon. COP is the yearly United Nations Climate Change Conference, in which states discuss and agree on measures to deal with the environment. This year the 28th edition of the conference will be held in Dubai, according to the UN. The UN’s calendar does not include anything after that yet. Last year’s climate summit saw negotiators from nearly 200 countries take the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030. However, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal."

ExxonMobil and Chevron                              (CVX) have urged shareholders to reject them. Follow This has called on the companies, along with European oil majors BP                              (BP), Shell                              (RDSA) and TotalEnergies                              (TOT), to set more ambitious targets for cutting their “scope 3” emissions by the end of the decade. Those emissions include the greenhouse gases emitted when their products, such as gasoline, jet fuel and natural gas, are used by customers. The group says the revised targets would better align the companies with the Paris climate agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, told CNN that the Norwegian fund had a “huge responsibility,” adding that it was surprising it hadn’t taken similar action against European energy firms at their shareholder meetings. “Basically, they are saying to Shell, BP and Total: You don’t have to reduce your emissions this decade. We expect them to correct this oversight next year,” he said. The fund did not vote with activists against BP and Shell at their most recent annual shareholder meetings, held last month and last week respectively. Explaining that decision, a spokesperson told CNN Friday that BP and Shell have outlined how their “scope 3” goals align with the Paris agreement. “While the targets of these three companies differ, they all demonstrate sector leading ambitions,” the spokesperson added. The Norwegian fund also did not participate in a shareholder rebellion at TotalEnergies’ annual meeting in Paris on Friday, which saw 30% vote in favor of a climate resolution put forward by Follow This. The group said the vote matched a revolt it led at Shell’s shareholder meeting in 2021. ExxonMobil, which has not set “scope 3” targets, said in a letter to shareholders last month that such targets would encourage oil and gas companies to divest their assets, reducing the supply of products “that society needs.” “Make no mistake, we are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” the company said. Chevron aims to reduce its carbon emissions by 5% over the next five years from a 2016 baseline, a target that covers “scope 3” emissions, but has urged shareholders to reject activist proposals. The proposal would “require shrinking Chevron’s business,” the company said in a letter to shareholders last month. In an statement to CNN, Chevron said that its “approach to scope 3 emissions enables it to maintain or grow its oil and gas business in response to market demand,” while “still addressing its intent to reduce emission intensity.” ExxonMobil did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the voting intentions of Norway’s wealth fund, which is financed by the country’s vast oil and gas revenues. It owns shares in more than 9,200 companies across 63 countries, with total equity holdings of $790 billion. It holds a 0.86% stake in Chevron and a 1.13% stake in ExxonMobil, according to the latest fund data. In its statement Friday, the fund also said it was calling for Chevron CEO Mike Wirth and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods to resign as chairmen of the companies’ boards because it believed the top roles should be performed by two different people. “The board should exercise objective judgment on corporate affairs and be able to make decisions independently of management,” the fund said on its website."

They come via social media, its website, letters, phone calls – even in the form of graffiti sprayed across one of its buildings. Abuse and harassment “have always happened” against the agency’s scientists, Estrella Gutiérrez-Marco, spokesperson for AEMET, told CNN. But there has been a rapid rise recently, coinciding with extreme weather in Spain. A severe drought has shrunk water levels to alarming lows, exacerbated by record-breaking April temperatures. The abuse got so bad that in April, AEMET posted a video on Twitter calling for an end to the harassment, and asking for respect. Even the government intervened. Teresa Ribera, Spain’s minister for the ecological transition, posted on Twitter in support of the agency: “Lying, giving wings to conspiracy and fear, insulting … It is time to say enough.” The harassment of meteorologists by conspiracy theorists and climate deniers is not a phenomenon confined to Spain. National weather services, meteorologists and climate communicators in countries from the US to Australia say they’re experiencing an increase in threats and abuse, often around accusations they are overstating, lying about or even controlling the weather. In Spain’s case, much of the trolling revolves around the rehashing of an old conspiracy theory: so-called “chemtrails.” Under many of the agency’s Twitter posts, especially those that refer to more extreme weather, users have posted images of blue skies, crisscrossed with wispy, white trails. They falsely claim the trails contain a cocktail of chemicals to artificially manipulate the weather – keeping rain away and causing climate change. It’s a theory roundly rejected by scientists. Airplanes do release vapor trails called contrails, short for condensation trails, which form when water vapor condenses into ice crystals around the small particles emitted by jet engines. But scientists have been clear: There is no evidence “chemtrails” exist. In April, meteorologist Isabel Moreno wrote a tweet saying “rain skips Spain,” with an image of a band of rain stretching across Europe but missing Spain almost entirely. She was completely unprepared for the response. “It was one of the hardest experiences in social media in my life,” said Moreno, who appears on the Spanish TV channel RTVE. “I received HUNDREDS of responses to an (apparently) inoffensive tweet,” she told CNN in an email. Many accused her of covering up weather manipulation. “Do not take us for idiots,” said one. “They dry us up, and you are the spokesperson for those who do it,” said another. And on, and on. While there were plenty of supportive messages, too, it was scary, Moreno said. “I have never seen either that amount of responses nor that level of aggression.” It took days for her to be able to go onto Twitter again without feeling anxious or stressed. This phenomenon may be particularly pronounced in Spain, but it spreads much wider. In France, meteorologists have been accused of exaggerating the country’s drought and heat. Météo France, the French national meteorological service, said the agency’s communications are “the object of more and more repeated attacks,” a Météo France spokesman told CNN. Climate misinformation on social media is particularly widespread, he said. It “seems to be on the rise, both in terms of the number of attacks directed against scientific publications but also the increasingly aggressive tone of the insults.” In Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology has been bombarded with criticism of its reporting of temperature records, with claims they have been inflated to make climate change seem worse. A spokeswoman for BOM called these claims inaccurate. “The Bureau transparently reports on and provides access to its very large climate data records,” she said. And in the UK, meteorologists reported unprecedented levels of online harassment during last year’s record-breaking heat wave, which led to the first-ever “red warning” for heat. “As scientists communicated this information, they were accused of instigating a nanny state hysteria,” Liz Bentley, the chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, told CNN. The Met Office was even accused of changing the color palette of its maps to make them look more dramatic. “We hadn’t, it was just really hot,” Oliver Claydon, a communications officer at the Met Office, told CNN. US meteorologists and climate communicators have not escaped the barrage of abuse and conspiracies. “Whenever I posted about global topics, like the yearly temperature report, the comments section would be filled with political jabs and conspiracy theories,” said Elisa Raffa, a broadcast meteorologist with Queen City News, based in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a woman in the media, she more often receives comments about her appearance than the science she’s communicating, she told CNN. Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, said she’s seen a ramp up of abuse lately. “I receive almost daily verbal declarations of my ignorance and climate alarmism,” she told CNN. Some disinformation experts draw a straight line from the conspiracies that flourished during the Covid pandemic – when experts faced a slew of abuse – to the uptick in climate conspiracies. People need “trending” topics on which to hang these theories, said Alexandre López-Borrull, a lecturer in the Information and Communication Sciences Department at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya in Spain. As Covid-19 fades from the headlines, climate change has become a strong rallying point. There’s been a big increase in “insults directed at all organizations related to the weather,” he told CNN. “It’s a logical evolution of the broader trend around pushback on institutions, and the erosion of trust,” said Jennie King, the head of Climate Research and Policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank focused on disinformation and extremism. These kinds of conspiracies are usually grounded in the idea that a set of institutions is “using the pretext of climate change, or the pretext of solving public policy issues, to enact some insidious agenda,” she told CNN. And the weather is an easy way in. Many aspects of climate science can feel very technical or abstract, but the weather is something people interact with frequently, said King. “It’s a much more immediate way to bring a wider audience into that skepticism … planting seeds of doubt against the climate agenda writ large,” she said. The role meteorologists have in explaining how climate change affects the weather, especially extreme weather, is a particular flashpoint. Extreme weather can be alarming, especially when there are consequences and sacrifices, such as Spain’s water restrictions. Conspiracy theories feed on this fear by offering a simple, enticing explanation, said López-Borrull. It’s easier to believe climate change is fake, or a manipulation by powerful people, than get your head around the complex problem and what it means for society. “Change is hard and scary,” Francis said It’s difficult to combat conspiracy theories when they bubble up. Some experts say they offer simple charts and rebuttals when they can, but try to ignore those who come in bad faith. Doug McNeall, a climate scientist and statistician at the Met Office Hadley Centre, a UK research center, said that, as a scientist, he welcomes being challenged. “If people come with better evidence, and you change your mind, that’s good,” he told CNN. But that’s not been his recent experience. “These people were not coming with better evidence,” he said. “They were coming to stop us talking about climate science.” He now relies much more on the block button. Moreno echoed this. “I find it very difficult to change the minds of people that really have strong beliefs in these conspiracies,” she said. It’s easier to prevent the ideas from taking hold in people in the first place by tackling the myths and explaining how the atmosphere works, she added. This kind of communication can really help, said King. Some of the best initiatives are “when media outlets or scientific institutions really try to demystify the process of how they produce public interest data,” she said. King worries about the impact of these conspiracies on climate politics. “If we want to implement any policies, ambitious or not, around the environmental agenda, and the acute crisis of climate change, it does now seem that this is going to rear its head,” she said. López-Borrull hopes meteorologists and climate communicators will persevere and not be pushed away from online spaces. “The answer is not disappearing or closing social media profiles … they have to remain on social media because they are really useful,” López-Borrull said. But as the climate crisis causes more extreme weather, harassment could increase even further. And it takes a toll, said Raffa. “I think it’s easy for people to forget I’m human, some of those comments can be hurtful. I’m just trying to do my job.”"

","Shania Shelton, CNN","A new oral history project focused on former President Barack Obama’s administration was released on Wednesday, with the first installment centering on climate. The project consists of work completed by Incite, an interdisciplinary social science research institute at Columbia University, since 2019. The work from the past four years includes 470 interviews and about 1,100 hours of audio and video with senior officials, policymakers, activists and others involved with the Obama administration. Peter Bearman, director of Incite at Columbia University, said the project was motivated by “an urge to decenter the experience of the president and center the study around the experiences and interactions of people both inside and outside of the administration. He said many of the narratives in the first installment speak about key environmental and energy issues that took place during the Obama administration, including the Keystone Pipeline, food and food security, energy and international climate negotiations, such as the Paris Agreement. Climate is one of about 40 issue domains the project focuses on. Other sets of interviews on topics such as health care and Black politics are planned to be released throughout the rest of this year and into 2024. During a Wednesday discussion previewing the oral history project, panelists focused on climate change and the environment and discussed how climate was prominent in the Obama years, from his initial campaign and throughout his years in office. “We pushed very hard during the campaign to raise the climate issue,” environmental activist Frances Beinecke said. “And we raised it during the primaries, and then when he was the candidate we raised it. During that period, we also worked on the platform, on the Democratic platform, making sure that climate was a main feature of the platform.” The initial release consists of 17 of the hundreds of interviews. Former US Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, former Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Gina McCarthy and environmental activist Bill McKibben are among those interviewed in the first release of the series. Valerie Jarrett, former senior adviser to Obama, referred to climate as “one of the largest threats and concerns” and “one of the biggest priorities” for Obama. “By preserving these narratives, we ensure that future generations have access to the lived experiences and lessons learned,” Jarrett said during the event. “But ultimately, these interviews will serve a lot as an important record for both historians and scholars, to not just learn, but to learn with an act towards the future.”"

But even at that threshold – which could begin to be breached within the next five years – millions of people will still face “significant harm,” including death, displacement and food and water scarcity, an international commission of researchers reported Wednesday. In a study published in the journal Nature, the panel of more than a dozen researchers integrated environmental justice – the idea that climate thresholds should minimize significant harm – with climate science. And with that standard, they found the world has already breached critical boundaries, leaving less safe, habitable space for life on Earth. At 1.5 degrees Celsius, the authors found that more than 200 million people could still be exposed to unprecedented heat, and more than 500 million people would be exposed to longterm sea level rise. And they said that the key climate threshold nations pledged to meet in the Paris Agreement in 2015 – one that would ensure a “safe and just” world – should have been 1 degree Celsius. But the planet’s average temperature has already soared to around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, which has already triggered catastrophic and deadly climate and weather changes, including more extreme heat waves, floods and landscape-altering wildfires. “Science is showing clearly that we are at risk of destabilizing the entire planet and its life support systems,” said Johan Rockström, the lead author on the study and director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and co-chair of the Earth Commission. “Unfortunately, the doctor will tell you that we are moving in the wrong direction on basically all of these living components that build up this complex, adaptive, self-regulating system,” he told reporters, likening the study to a doctor’s visit, and that the prescription is “a list of quantitative safe and just boundary conditions that you have to live within to be able to cure yourself.” While past scientific efforts to define Earth’s boundaries have been strong and compelling, climate science has historically looked at the conditions needed to maintain the planet’s stability, but excluded justice as a key component, said Joyeeta Gupta, a co-author on the study and an environmental researcher at the University of Amsterdam. “We argue that there is no safe planet without justice,” Gupta said, underscoring that incorporating justice to the Earth system’s boundaries reduces significant harm to communities and individuals. The research is a “worthy attempt” to identify and quantify the human toll associated with different levels of environmental degradation, such as climate change, water availability and biodiversity, said Kim Cobb, climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved with the study but was a lead author on the most recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. “This paper highlights the human costs of the emissions choices we are making every single year – costs that will extend many generations into the future, when we do not move to enact emissions in line with the most ambitious targets,” Cobb told CNN. It also “provides further ammunition to climate justice advocates as policymakers seek a greater understanding of how continued warming will worsen existing climate injustices from region to region and across the next decades to centuries.” Scientists are calling on governments, businesses and policymakers to take the crisis more seriously as climate thresholds are breached and the world gets warmer. “The intention of this paper was to try and show that there is already a lot of damage at 1 degree, and that this is more just than a 1.5-degree target,” Gupta said. “We want to make sure that countries take this as seriously as possible.”"

",Amanda McClelland and Dr. Tom Frieden,"A pandemic emerges. It spreads around the world, claims lives and devastates economies for decades. Climate change makes it even deadlier. It infects hundreds of millions of people and kills millions, especially in areas with limited resources. Is this a future scenario? A tabletop exercise? No. It’s cholera today, a pandemic that has been circulating around the world for more than 60 years. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need to strengthen our protection against microbial threats. We can end the cholera pandemic as well as others currently circulating and, in doing so, make the world healthier and safer. Measures to prepare for the next pandemic are essential, but controlling the many deadly diseases spreading today is the best way to rapidly protect the world from future threats. Cholera, which spreads primarily through contaminated water and food, causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. The ongoing El Tor pandemic, also known as the seventh cholera pandemic, emerged in Indonesia in 1961 and has spread to more than 50 countries. Climate change is worsening cholera, facilitating its spread to new areas and its persistence in unsanitary water. There are outbreaks in 24 countries, causing an estimated 1.3 million to 4 million cases and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths per year, primarily among young children. Marshaling a global effort to end the El Tor pandemic can save lives, forge a pathway for better collaboration against future pandemics, hasten economic development and, as a byproduct, save millions of lives from other diseases spread by contaminated water. The Global Task Force on Cholera Control was created in 1992 in the context of an unprecedent cholera outbreak in Peru. The task force was revitalized in 2014 and in 2017 declared a commitment to end cholera, reducing the disease by 90% by 2030. But now, just seven years from that date, cholera is still spreading in dozens of countries. The World Bank and the World Health Organization could play central roles in ending cholera; commitment from heads of state and leadership of the United Nations will be essential. Three interventions are essential to ending the cholera pandemic: clean water, rapid diagnosis and treatment, and vaccination. The failure to implement these interventions mirrors our inadequate response to Covid: failure to address environmental conditions that allow the microbe to spread (safe water to stop cholera and better ventilation to protect from Covid), weak primary health care and public health systems that are too slow to diagnose and treat patients, and insufficient vaccine production and distribution to where and when they can save the most lives rather than who can pay the most money. After John Snow proved in the 1850s that cholera was spread through contaminated water, wealthier countries and regions built safe drinking water and sanitation systems. Yet today, 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water, 3 billion lack handwashing facilities with soap, and nearly half of the world doesn’t have access to basic sanitation. Water treatment is one of the most cost-effective of all health interventions. In the 1990s, Peru ended its cholera epidemic by chlorinating the water supply. Simply adding chlorine to water kills the bacteria that causes cholera, as well as many other disease pathogens. Clean water has massive health and economic benefits. It is believed to be the single largest driver of improved health in the first half of the 20th century – but only in higher-income countries. Lower-income countries haven’t benefited from this basic life-saving intervention. Bringing clean water to the world wouldn’t just stop cholera, it would also finally end polio, improve child survival and increase productivity by reducing illness in workers. The second necessary intervention is to improve detection and treatment. Health care systems need to improve their ability to diagnose cholera and report it to public health authorities, and public health authorities need to respond rapidly, including with use of oral rehydration solutions, which can drastically reduce the risk of death among people with cholera. Time is lives. A 7-1-7 global target for detection and response can facilitate evaluation and focus attention on results, much as the 90-90-90 target drove down AIDS deaths. Aiming for outbreaks to be detected within seven days – too long for cholera outbreaks but a good first target – and to be reported to public health authorities within one day and establishing the essential components of an effective response, as defined by objective benchmarks, within the next seven days establishes the urgency of rapid outbreak response. The 7-1-7 target enables countries to find gaps and to close them quickly. If we consistently hit this target, we can reduce spread of cholera and other diseases. The third intervention is wider use of oral cholera vaccines, a new tool in our armamentarium. But there aren’t enough cholera vaccine doses being produced, and the vaccine is more effective at preventing outbreaks than stopping them. When one private company stopped making the vaccines, the world didn’t move quickly enough to finance and develop alternatives, so now there’s a major shortage. Korean and South African companies are working quickly but it will take years before their efforts help fill this gap. This is a systems failure that needs a systems-level response, including planning; reliable funding via Gavi, the vaccine alliance; collaboration with vaccine producers and new manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC); and financing mechanisms. These mechanisms could include advanced market commitments; private sector cross-subsidies from profits of publicly funded vaccines; requiring manufacturers who profit from vaccines such as those for Covid to subsidize vaccines for which there isn’t a profitable market, such as those for cholera, yellow fever and typhoid; and new financial instruments such as taxes and bonds. With increased urbanization and warmer environments, the need for cholera vaccines could continue to increase; expanding manufacturing capacity and ensuring multiple producers will be necessary to make supply reliable. Safe water, better health care and public health, and expanded vaccine access require community engagement, political leadership and accountability. Communities must lead and be engaged in implementing solutions, otherwise water systems will not be improved and maintained, health care and public health won’t be connected to the people most in need, and vaccines won’t be accepted or even available. Political leadership is the only way to sustain the political attention and secure the financial and capital needed to build and maintain the systems that are so badly needed. A high-level United Nations General Assembly-mandated Global Health Threats Council with the technical leadership of WHO can drive cross-national, multisectoral accountability and break the world’s panic-and-neglect cycle. We’re right to be concerned about the Next Big Pandemic. But we also need to stop the pandemics afflicting us today. We can start by going back to the basics of clean water and sanitation that stopped cholera in London, New York and other large cities more than 150 years ago, improving primary care and public health, and expanding vaccine production. Doing so will not only end cholera and reduce other leading killers, it will also make the world much better prepared for future health crises. Amanda McClelland, a registered nurse, is the senior vice president of Prevent Epidemics at Resolve to Save Lives, where she leads a global team working to accelerate progress to make the world safer from the next epidemic.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/01/weather/hurricane-season-what-to-expect-climate/index.html,Hurricane season starts today. Here’s what to expect,06/01/2023,"                                                 Hurricane outlooks have called for an average season, but forecasters are warning that even average years have the potential to lash coastal states with devastating storms.                                             ","Angela Fritz and Brandon Miller, CNN","Hurricane season begins today, and while the outlooks have called for an average season, forecasters are warning that even typical years have the potential to lash coastal states with devastating storms. Here’s what to expect in the coming months. CNN tracked two hurricane season outlooks this year: the forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which was released last week, and another from researchers at Colorado State University, who have been issuing seasonal forecasts for more than 37 years. NOAA officials are predicting an average hurricane season, with 12 to 17 named tropical storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes. They expect as many of four of those could strengthen into major hurricanes – category 3 or stronger. Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State, said in April his group was predicting a slightly below-average season this year: 13 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes. The key difference between tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes lies in their wind speeds and the level of organization within the system. While a tropical depression represents the earliest stage of cyclone development, named tropical storms exhibit more structure and stronger winds. Hurricanes — the most powerful and dangerous of the three — possess the strongest winds and a well-defined eye, making them capable of causing extensive damage over large areas. Read more: Hurricane categories and other terminology, explained None of the seasonal outlooks go as far as to predict how many storms could make landfall in the Caribbean or the US. But history has shown that even in years with average or below-average storms, deadly landfalls are still possible. Last year, for instance, was an average season, but Hurricane Ian was a catastrophe for Florida. The storm killed more than 100 people when it made landfall in September, devastated the coast around Fort Myers and caused inland flooding that lasted weeks. Florida was then struck by Hurricane Nicole in November, which tore the beach out from under homes in Volusia County, leaving them teetering on the brink of collapse. There have been six category 4 or 5 hurricanes to hit the mainland since 2017, the most ever during a six-year period. Climate change, especially the buildup of heat increasing the ocean’s temperature, is leading to a larger percentage of hurricanes reaching the highest categories on the scale – a trend that is likely to continue as global temperatures climb. This hurricane season’s activity will largely depend on two competing factors: El Niño, which inhibits storm development, and near record-high ocean temperatures, which will help fuel hurricanes. El Niño is characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, and tends to increase upper-level winds over the Atlantic, which disrupt and suppress hurricane formation. El Niño’s influence on this season is still somewhat uncertain because it is only just beginning to develop. That it will eventually form this year is a “foregone conclusion,” Klotzbach told CNN last week. But there’s another factor that could negate or even outweigh El Niño’s influence this year: Sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean are already at or near record-high levels, and in a way that “matches up quite well with what we associate with active Atlantic hurricane seasons,” Klotzbach said. “If these warm anomalies in the North Atlantic persist through the hurricane season, it has the potential to cause less of an El Niño (wind) shear impact than we normally see,” he said, and that possibility is even showing up in “several climate model forecasts” for the summer and fall. Hurricanes are natural phenomena shaped by complex atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. But they are now increasingly influenced by human-caused climate change. As our planet continues to warm due to fossil fuel pollution, the impacts are manifesting in the intensification and altered behavior of these destructive storms. Through a combination of warmer waters, increased atmospheric moisture and rising sea levels, the climate crisis has set the stage for hurricanes to pose unprecedented risks to coastal communities. The World Meteorological Organization chooses hurricane names and the list rotates every six years. Names are gendered alternately through the season, and the list excludes names starting with the letters Q, U, X, Y or Z. If there are more than 21 storms in a season, the names transition to the Greek alphabet. Some names are retired after particularly devastating storms. “Ian” and “Fiona” were retired last year, for example, and 96 names have been retired from the list since 1953. Read more: The fascinating and controversial history behind hurricane names Hurricanes can form at any time during the warm season and late into fall, but on average they peak in the Atlantic in the early fall – which is also around the time that the strongest storms tend to make landfall in the US. Hurricane season ends on November 30, though there have been several instances where storms continued to form well after that date. In 2005 – the same year Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans – Hurricane Epsilon formed on November 29 and dissipated December 10. It was followed by an extremely late-season storm, Tropical Storm Zeta, that formed December 30 and lasted into January."

This year, extreme heat has ravaged many parts of the country even earlier than last year. Pigs, rabbits and fish have been dying from the searing temperatures, and wheat fields in central China have been flooded by the heaviest rainfall in a decade. Meanwhile, officials are worried that drought could hit the Yangtze River basin, China’s main rice-growing region, in the coming months. Since March, temperatures in dozens of Chinese cities have hit record seasonal highs. The heat wave has escalated in recent days, with a number of cities in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces suffering record-breaking temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit. By Wednesday, 578 national weather stations located in different cities across the country recorded their highest ever temperatures for this time of year, according to the China Meteorological Administration. “Extreme weather such as drought and floods may disrupt the food production order and bring more uncertainties to the supply of food and oil,” Sheng Xia, chief agricultural analyst for Citic Securities, wrote in a research report on Wednesday. He warned of increasing threats to food security this year because of the looming El Niño, a natural phenomenon in the tropical Pacific Ocean that brings warmer-than-average temperatures. El Niño could, for the first time, push the world past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above the pre-industrial levels of the mid-to-late 1800s. “For China, the El Niño event will easily lead to increased climate uncertainty in the Yangtze River Basin, causing flooding in the south and drought in the north, and cold summer in the northeast,” said Sheng. Last month, the World Meteorological Organization said the likelihood of El Niño developing later this year was increasing. Following last year’s severe heat wave and drought, Beijing strengthened its focus on food security. In March, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said agriculture was the foundation of national security. “Once something’s wrong with agriculture, our bowls will be held in someone else’s hands and we’ll have to depend on others for food. How can we achieve modernization in that case?” he said in an article published in March by Qiushi, the Communist Party’s main theoretical journal. In recent days, reports of farm animals killed by extreme heat have dominated the news. At a farm in eastern Jiangsu province, hundreds of pigs died this week after a sudden power outage caused fans to stop working at night, according to several state media reports. The pigs suffocated to death amid extreme heat and poor air circulation, Jimu News, a government-owned news website, cited an unnamed employee at the farm as saying. The heat wave was blamed for killing large numbers of farmed carp living in rice fields in the southwestern region of Guangxi. Villagers told the South of China Today newspaper on Wednesday that their fish were “burned to death” as water temperatures soared due to hot weather. The prices of rabbit heads, a signature dish in Sichuan, have surged in recent days as high temperatures caused rabbit deaths on farms, resulting in tighter supply. Spicy rabbit heads are a popular street food in the southwestern province, where residents consume more than 200 million of the heads a year, according to industry association figures. Extreme weather conditions have also affected the country’s largest wheat-growing region. Heavy rainfall flooded the wheat fields of Henan, a central province which accounts for a quarter of China’s production, in the last week of May, just days before harvest time. The rains caused some grain crops to sprout or go moldy. The ruined crop accounted for 20% of some farmers’ yields for the whole year, according to the state-run China Media Group. It was said to be the worst rainfall taking place near harvest season in more than a decade. And more extreme weather events are likely to come. From May to September, “drought and flooding might occur simultaneously,” with more extreme climate events such as heavy rainfall and heat waves hitting the country, according to a recent estimate by the national climate center. Sheng noted that the heat wave and lack of rainfall in the far western region of Xinjiang had already affected some corn and wheat production. In the next few months, precipitation in the middle reaches of the mighty Yangtze River, which bisects the country, may be significantly reduced, according to an official estimate. That could lead to a drought and affect the region’s rice crops, he said. The Yangtze River basin provides more than two thirds of China’s rice, a major food staple at home and abroad."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/05/politics/hydrogen-goal-biden-administration-energy-climate/index.html,The Biden administration sees hydrogen as a game-changing climate technology. The reality is far more complicated,06/05/2023,"                                                 The Biden administration on Monday announced a goal to produce 50 million metric tons of clean hydrogen fuel by 2050 – a roadmap that, if successful, would cut around 10% of the country’s planet-warming pollution by the same date.                                             ","Ella Nilsen, CNN","The Biden administration on Monday announced a goal to produce 50 million metric tons of clean hydrogen fuel by 2050 – a roadmap that, if successful, would cut around 10% of the country’s planet-warming pollution by the same date. For the US to transition to clean energy, it will take technologies beyond wind and solar to fuel airplanes, generate electricity and power industry. And the Biden administration is increasingly looking towards hydrogen to meet the demand – a source of energy that burns without pollution and that can be derived from water. But it also could be generated by the fossil fuels it seeks to replace. Clean hydrogen is the “Swiss army knife of zero-carbon technologies,” US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters Monday. “If we get it right, it can do just about everything.” Granholm and President Joe Biden’s top climate adviser, Ali Zaidi, said they would reveal in September the locations of several new “hydrogen hubs” around the country. The hubs would serve as pilot projects for a reimagined, hydrogen-fueled economy that Zaidi said would “fundamentally change the way we build things in America.” “We believe it could decarbonize some of our hardest to abate sectors, like heavy industry and transportation,” Granholm said. “It could also generate clean, dispatchable electricity and provide options for long-duration energy storage.” But hydrogen has its critics – namely, those who are concerned about a potential over-reliance on hydrogen that is derived from fossil fuels like methane gas, versus hydrogen that can be created from water. If hydrogen is made from fossil fuels, “all it does is keep the fossil fuel industry in business, it does not help with climate,” said Mark Jacobson, director of Stanford University’s atmosphere and energy program, and a hydrogen expert. A forthcoming academic study for which Jacobson is the lead author finds the US would need about 14 million metric tons of hydrogen per year by 2050 to achieve its decarbonization goals for steel, agriculture and heavy-duty transportation industries – whereas the administration’s figure would result in about 2 million metric tons per year. “I think that’s woefully inadequate for what we need,” Jacobson said. And while there’s intense work happening on the technology, it is still years from being fully commercially viable. “When you’re creating an entirely new sector, which is really what this hydrogen clean economy will be, you have to do everything everywhere all at once,” Granholm said. The electricity sector is already seeing a shift to renewable energy like solar and wind, which are steadily replacing fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. But solar and wind energy aren’t going to be helpful for the largest, most polluting vehicles and industries where batteries are not an option. This is where hydrogen has the most potential. Airplanes, for instance, require so much energy that any battery used to store electricity from solar or wind would likely be too large and heavy. Hydrogen, on the other hand, can come in liquid form and is far lighter. Hydrogen also has the potential to help decarbonize heavy industry, which can be tough to power with wind and solar. It factors into the Biden administration’s overall strategy to decarbonize the power sector – which holds the key to then decarbonizing transportation due to the rise of electric cars. Renewables such as wind and solar have a big role to play in zero-emissions power, but because sunlight and wind are intermittent, there is a scramble to find a source of electricity that can be easily turned on with the flick of a switch. Hydrogen is one of the technologies that could help. The Environmental Protection Agency is factoring it into their proposed rule to cut power plant emissions – suggesting that natural gas plants could co-fire with clean hydrogen. “Clean” hydrogen is a fraught term because hydrogen can be derived from several different sources – some cleaner than others. Green hydrogen, the cleanest form, is derived from electrolyzing water – putting an electric current through water to separate molecules that can then be used as fuel. However, green hydrogen is only truly zero-emissions if the electricity it’s created with comes from renewable sources. Gray hydrogen is commonly used today and is derived from fossil fuels – including methane gas – and contributes to planet-warming emissions. Blue hydrogen is also derived from fossil fuels like methane gas, but unlike gray hydrogen, its emissions are captured – making it a potentially cleaner source of fuel. But Jacobson said capturing hydrogen emissions can be an expensive boondoggle; blue hydrogen needs to capture both hydrogen and carbon dioxide emissions – and carbon capture doesn’t also get at methane emissions from upstream gas operations. Gray and blue hydrogen have drawn concern from environmental groups for their ties to fossil fuels. And even green hydrogen has some detractors who worry that using wind and solar to power hydrogen isn’t the best use of renewable energy. Still, Biden administration officials made clear they see the technology as one with huge potential to cut emissions and create new jobs. Zaidi on Monday spoke of a factory in Minnesota that used to make diesel engines but is now manufacturing electrolyzers to make hydrogen. And Granholm estimated clean hydrogen would create around 100,000 jobs by the end of the decade. “This is an enormous opportunity,” Granholm said."

To get through the heat of the day, he equipped himself with a hat, wet handkerchiefs and several bottles of water – precautions that provided little relief as recorded daytime temperatures soared to more than 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). The average May temperature in Hanoi is 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit). “If I get a heatstroke, I would be forced to suspend driving to recover,” he told CNN. “But I cannot afford it.” Phong, who declined to give his surname, said he carries a tiny umbrella to protect his phone, the main tool he uses for work as a driver for the ride-hailing platform Grab, along with his bike. If the phone breaks, he misses out on much-needed income. “I was worried that the battery would overheat once exposed to the sun,” he said. Nearby in the same city, sanitation worker Dinh Van Hung, 53, toils all day cleaning garbage from the bustling streets of Hanoi’s central Dong Da district. “It is impossible to avoid the heat, especially at noon and early afternoon,” Dinh told CNN. “Extreme temperatures also make the garbage smell more unpleasant, the hard work is now even more difficult, directly affecting my health and labor.” Dinh says “there is no other way” but to change when he starts and finishes his shift. “I try to work early in the morning or afternoon and evening,” he said. “During lunch break when the temperature is too high, I find a sidewalk in a small alley, spread out the cardboard sheets to rest for a while and then resume work in the afternoon.” Phong and Dinh are among millions of drivers, street vendors, cleaners, builders, farmers, and other outdoor or informal economy workers across Southeast Asia who were hit the hardest during what experts called the region’s “harshest heat wave on record.” Workers like them make up the backbone of many societies but are disproportionately affected by extreme weather events, with dangerously high temperatures greatly impacting their health and the already precarious nature of their professions. April and May are typically the hottest months of the year in Southeast Asia, as temperatures rise before monsoon rains bring some relief. But this year, they reached levels never experienced before in most countries of the region, including tourism hotspots Thailand and Vietnam. Thailand saw its hottest day in history at 45.4 degrees Celsius (114 degrees Fahrenheit) on April 15, while neighboring Laos topped out at 43.5 degrees Celsius (110 degrees Fahrenheit) for two consecutive days in May, and Vietnam’s all-time record was broken in early May with 44.2 degrees Celsius (112 degrees Fahrenheit), according to analysis of weather stations data by a climatologist and weather historian Maximiliano Herrera. Herrera described it as “the most brutal never-ending heat wave” that has continued into June. On June 1, Vietnam broke the record for its hottest June day in history with 43.8 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit) – with 29 days of the month to go. In a recent report from the World Weather Attribution (WWA), an international coalition of scientists said the April heat wave in Southeast Asia was a once-in-200-years event that would have been “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change. The scorching heat in Southeast Asia was made even more unbearable and dangerous due to high humidity – a deadly combination. Humidity, on top of extreme temperatures, makes it even harder for your body to try and cool itself down. Heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion, have severe symptoms and can be life-threatening, especially for those with heart disease and kidney problems, diabetes, and pregnant people. “When the surrounding humidity is very high, the body will continue to sweat trying to release moisture to cool itself, but because the sweat is not evaporating it will eventually lead to severe dehydration, and in acute cases it can lead to heat strokes and deaths,” said Mariam Zachariah, research associate in near-real time attribution of extreme events to climate change at World Weather Attribution initiative at Imperial College London. “Which is why a humid heat wave is more dangerous than a dry heat wave,” she told CNN. To understand the health risks of humid heat, scientists often calculate the “feels-like” temperature – a single measure of how hot it feels to the human body when air temperature and humidity are both taken into account, sometimes alongside other factors such as wind chill. Perceived heat is usually several degrees higher than observed temperature and gives a more accurate reading of how heat affects people. CNN analysis of Copernicus Climate Change Service data found that between early April and late May, all six countries in the continental portion of Southeast Asia had reached perceived temperatures close to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) or more every single day. This is above a threshold considered dangerous, especially for people with health problems or those not used to extreme heat. In Thailand, 20 days in April and at least 10 days in May reached feels-like temperatures above 46 degrees Celsius (115 degrees Fahrenheit). At this level, thermal heat stress becomes “extreme” and is considered life threatening for anybody including healthy people used to extreme humid heat. Throughout April and May, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Malaysia all had several days with potential to cause extreme heat stress. Myanmar had 12 such days – until Cyclone Mocha brought relative relief, but severe devastation, when it made landfall on May 14. The April-May heat wave in Southeast Asia caused widespread hospitalizations, damaged roads, sparked fires and led to school closures, however the number of deaths remains unknown, according to the World Weather Attribution report. The study found that, because of climate change, the heat was more than two degrees hotter in perceived temperature than it could have been without global warming caused by pollution. “When the atmosphere becomes warmer, its ability to hold the moisture becomes higher and therefore the chances of humid heat waves also increase,” Zachariah, one of the authors, told CNN. If global warming continues to increase to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), such humid heat waves could occur ten times more often, according to the study. And if emissions continue to increase at the same pace, the next two decades could already see 30 more deaths per million from heat in Thailand, and 130 more deaths per million by the end of the century, according to the UN’s Human Climate Horizons projections. For Myanmar that number would be 30 and 520 more deaths per million respectively, for Cambodia – 40 and 270, data shows. Extreme weather events also expose systemic inequalities. “Occupation, age, health conditions and disabilities, access to health care services, socioeconomic status, even gender – these are all factors that can make people more or less vulnerable to heat waves,” said Chaya Vaddhanaphuti, one of the WWA report’s authors and lecturer at the department of geography at Chiang Mai University in Thailand. Marginalized members of society, those without adequate access to healthcare and cooling systems, and those in jobs that are exposed to extremely hot and humid conditions are most at risk of heat stress. “It’s important to talk about who can adapt, who can cope, and who has the resources to be able to do this,” Emmanuel Raju, also an author and director of the Copenhagen Center for Disaster Research, said in a press conference on May 17. “For those working in the informal economy a lost day means a day lost in wages,” Raju said. More than 60% of the employed population in Southeast Asia work in informal employment, and over 80% in Cambodia and Myanmar, according to a 2018 International Labour Organization (ILO) report. In late April, Thai health authorities issued an extreme heat alert for the capital Bangkok and several other places across the country, warning people to stay indoors and of heat stroke dangers. But for migrant workers like Supot Klongsap, nicknamed “Nui,” who temporarily left his home to work in construction in Bangkok during the pre-monsoon season, staying indoors was simply not an option. He said that this year’s hot season was exceptional, causing him to sweat all the time and feel exhausted. “I started to sweat from 8 a.m., and it was difficult to work. I felt very exhausted from losing so much water.” Nui, who slept at the construction site, said even the nights were unbearable. “Water coming from the pipe even during nighttime remained very hot just like it was boiled. It was difficult to find comfort.” He said the accommodation for construction workers is roofed and walled with corrugated sheets, and it barely protects from heat. Any access to air-conditioned rooms is a luxury Nui couldn’t afford. “We had to rely on buying ice and adding it to our drinks, our simple way to cool down,” he said. A 2021 study found that outdoor workers in developing countries have higher core body temperature than to those working indoors, and they are two to three times more at risk of dehydration, leading to a higher chance of reduced kidney function and other related conditions. In Thailand, the government recommends reactive measures, such as staying indoors, hydrating adequately, wearing light-colored clothes, and avoiding certain foods, Chaya told CNN. “But that doesn’t mean that everybody has the same capacity to do so.” The burden of cost often falls on individuals, Chaya said, making it their responsibility to cope with the heat. What is needed, he said, is a cohesive international plan that can protect the more vulnerable populations in the face of increasing climate change risks, and proactive measures to prevent potential health issues. Governments need to develop large-scale solutions, such as early warning systems for heat, passive and active cooling for all, urban planning, and heat action plans, World Weather Attribution scientists recommended in their report. Intensifying heat waves not only affect individuals’ health, but threaten the environment and people’s livelihoods, worsen air quality, destroy crops, increase wildfire risk, and damage infrastructure – so the need for government action plans on heat waves are vital. In Yotpieng and Phon villages in northeastern Laos, people’s livelihoods are intimately connected with weather patterns. Villagers’ lives here revolve around tea. For centuries, every day at 7 a.m. the tea farmers start collecting leaves, until 11 a.m. when they would bring the harvest back home. The survival of these communities depends on collecting tea leaves to generate income for whole families. But this year’s extreme heat is disrupting their ability to work according to their ancient working habits – they had to change from working in the morning to the afternoon during heat waves, and they are worried the quality and quantity of tea leaves will be affected, members of the local community told CNN. ”[The] weather is extremely hot for everyone this year and farmers are struggling,” according to Chintanaphone Keovichith, management officer at the Lao Farmer Network. “This year the weather is hotter than last year, and the tea leaves are dry,” said tea farmer, Boua Seng. The manager of a 1,000-year-old tea processing factory, Vieng Samai Lobia Yaw, said she is worried this year’s tea leaves have not grown enough, which decreases harvest by almost 50% daily. “It’s so wasteful – we spend more capital on laborers’ fees but getting less product,” she said. For now, tea farmers in Laos have invented solutions to protect their trees. Some have planted large fruit trees, such as peach or plum, to provide shade for tea plantations, while others added more compost to nourish their plants. “The tea [trees] in the shade will have a nice green leaf, but the ones without shade will have yellow leaf,” explained tea farmer Thongsouk. “We also collect additional income by selling fruit products.” But they cannot do it alone. Without a comprehensive international approach to rapidly reduce planet-warming pollution and to address the interconnected impacts of extreme weather events on individuals, communities, and the environment, the health and economic costs from heat waves will only worsen as the climate crisis unfolds. As May turns into June, many are still waiting for some respite. “May was the worst month – that’s when the rain usually comes in, but this year [it] still hasn’t arrived yet,” said Chintanaphone. Reporting and writing Carlotta Dotto in Hong Kong and Krystina Shveda in London  Data graphics Lou Robinson and Krystina Shveda  Editing Helen Regan  Photo editing Noemi Cassanelli  Additional reporting Kocha Olarn in Bangkok"

",Matt Egan,"Forecasters at the US Energy Department on Tuesday ramped up their forecasts for American oil and gasoline prices next year, citing new steps by Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ to restrain the supply of oil. The US Energy Information Administration dimmed its estimate of global oil production through 2024 because of Saudi Arabia’s decision to slash oil production and an agreement by OPEC+ to extend its output cuts. Citing those supply cuts, the EIA said it expects “some upward pressure” on oil prices, “notably in late-2023 and early-2024.” The near-term impact will be modest, according to the analysis, with the forecast for US and Brent oil prices rising by around 2% for the rest of the year, compared with the May forecast. For gasoline, the EIA now sees retail prices averaging $3.41 a gallon during the third quarter, up by just 2.7% from the May forecast. But the bigger impact will be felt in 2024. The EIA boosted its forecast for US oil prices by 11.4% for the second quarter of next year and 14.5% for the third quarter. Oil prices are now expected to average $80 a barrel in the fourth quarter of next year, a 19.4% increase from the EIA’s prior forecast. This will drive up prices for consumers, relative to where they would have been before OPEC’s latest moves. The EIA said retail gasoline prices are now expected to average $3.38 a gallon in the third quarter of next year and $3.21 a gallon for the fourth quarter, up by 7.3% and 10.2%, respectively. Still, gas prices are expected to stay much lower than last summer, when the national average for regular gas spiked above $5 a gallon for the first time ever."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","The Arctic could be free of sea ice roughly a decade earlier than projected, scientists warn – another clear sign the climate crisis is happening faster than expected as the world continues to pump out planet-heating pollution. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications found Arctic sea ice could disappear completely during the month of September as early as the 2030s. Even if the world makes significant cuts to planet-heating pollution today, the Arctic could still see summers free of sea ice by the 2050s, scientists reported. The researchers analyzed changes from 1979 to 2019, comparing different satellite data and climate models to assess how Arctic sea ice was changing. They found that declining sea ice was largely the result of human-caused, planet-heating pollution, and previous models had underestimated Arctic sea ice melting trends. “We were surprised to find that an ice-free Arctic will be there in summer irrespective of our effort at reducing emissions, which was not expected,” Seung-Ki Min, lead author of the study and professor at Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea, told CNN. Arctic ice builds up during the winter and then melts in the summer, typically reaching its lowest levels in September, before the cycle begins again. Once Arctic summers become ice-free, the buildup of sea ice in the colder seasons will be much slower, Min said. The warmer it gets, the more likely the Arctic is to stay free of sea ice further into the colder season. Under a “higher emissions pathway” – in which the world continues to burn fossil fuels and levels of planet-warming pollution continue to rise – the study projects the Arctic will see a complete loss of sea ice from August until as late as October before the 2080s, Min said. The study’s findings contrast with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2021 state-of-the-science report, which found the Arctic would be “be practically ice-free near mid-century under intermediate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.” This new study shows it could happen 10 years earlier, regardless of emission scenarios, Min said. Over the past several decades, the Arctic has warmed four times faster than the rest of the world, a 2022 study showed. There has already been a rapid loss of sea ice in the region, with September sea ice shrinking at a rate of 12.6% per decade, according to NASA. An Arctic with no summer sea ice would send dire ripple effects around the world. The bright white ice reflects solar energy away from the Earth. When this ice melts, it exposes the darker ocean, which absorbs more heat causing additional warming – a feedback process called “Arctic amplification.” The decline of sea ice can also have an effect on global weather stretching well beyond the Arctic. “We need to prepare ourselves for a world with warmer Arctic very soon,” Min said. “Since Arctic warming is suggested to bring weather extremes like heatwaves, wildfires, and floods on Northern mid- and high latitudes, the earlier onset of an ice-free Arctic also implies that we will be experiencing extreme events faster than predicted.” A sea ice-free Arctic could also lead to an increase in commercial shipping as new routes open up, which would have a knock-on effect. According to last year’s annual Arctic report card by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a surge in shipping traffic would lead to more emissions and pollution in the region. Mika Rantanen, researcher with the Finnish Meteorological Institute and lead author of the 2022 study, told CNN the study published Tuesday benefited from “novel and state-of-the-art methodology” to predict when the Arctic will be ice-free. “The methodology is very careful and brings a high degree of certainty in the attribution,” said Rantanen, who was not involved in the study. “The most striking result is not that the sea ice loss is attributed to greenhouse gas increases, which was already largely known, but that they project ice-free Arctic earlier than previously thought by about decade.” Min said the findings show that the Arctic is on the verge of becoming “seriously ill,” and that the region has reached a “tipping point.” “We can regard the Arctic sea ice as the immune system of our body which protects our body from harmful things,” Min said. “Without the protector, the Arctic’s condition will go from bad to worse quickly.”"

But beyond the immediate, visceral impacts, the conflict is also causing a climate disaster at a time when the world is already struggling to meet climate goals, according to a new report. A team of carbon accounting experts has evaluated the climate impact of the first year of the conflict, which started in February 2022. They found that a total of 120 million metric tons of planet-heating pollution can be attributed to the first 12 months of the war, according to the report published Wednesday. That’s equivalent to the annual emissions of Belgium, or those produced by nearly 27 million gas-powered cars on the road for a year. “It’s the first time that the emissions of a war have been mapped on such a comprehensive scale,” Lennard de Klerk, the report’s lead author and an expert in war-related emissions, told CNN. The report, titled Climate Damage Caused by Russia’s War in Ukraine, follows on from a first interim assessment presented at the UN COP27 climate conference in November 2022. Data was drawn from a wide range of sources, including satellites, scientific papers, expert interviews, industry reports and open-source intelligence. The team of researchers looked at the climate impact of the planet-heating pollution produced directly from warfare, including fuel use for tanks, planes and other equipment, construction of fortifications and production of weapons. They also examined impacts from the consequences of the war, such as fires, destruction – and required reconstruction – of infrastructure and changes to the European energy mix. Nearly 22 million metric tons of planet-heating pollution came from warfare, almost 20% of the total emissions attributable to the conflict, the report found. But this may be a conservative estimate. The emissions of the military were challenging to calculate, de Klerk told CNN. It’s not possible, for example, to just get in touch with Russia to ask them how much fuel they are using in their tanks and planes, he said. “We probably will only be able to really get a more accurate estimate once the war is over,” de Klerk said. Others were easier to calculate, especially the amount of planet-warming pollution from fires caused by shelling, bombing and explosions. Using remote monitoring tools based on satellite data, the researchers concluded that these fires produced nearly 18 million metric tons, accounting for 15% of the total war emissions The number of fires burning over an area larger than one hectare (2.5 acres) increased 36-fold in the first year of the war compared to the 12 months before it started, according to the report. While the winter months saw fire activity dip, it is expected to pick up again as summer approaches, de Klerk said. The biggest climate impact, however, accounting for almost half the pollution from the war, will come from the post-war reconstruction of damaged and destroyed buildings and infrastructure, the report found. Rebuilding will require vast amounts of materials such as cement and concrete, which produce very high levels of carbon pollution. Over the course of the conflict, increasing Russian attacks on and destruction of energy infrastructure has pushed up the planet-heating pollution estimated to be produced during reconstruction, the report found. “The biggest chunk of the emissions are still in the future reconstruction of Ukraine,” de Klerk said. The report also looked at impacts outside of Ukraine, including the methane pollution released after the sabotage of the Russian gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2 in September 2022. “We had an enormous release of methane emissions… that was really a surprise,” de Klerk said. Changes to Europe’s energy mix were also analyzed but found a mixed outcome. Very high prices for gas and oil following Russia’s invasion caused Europe to make some decisions, including burning more coal, which increased levels of planet-heating pollution. But the conflict also helped usher in a faster transition to renewables, as countries looked to lessen their dependence on Russian oil and gas. The report authors even calculated the extra planet-warming pollution created by airlines rerouting flights to avoid Russian and Ukrainian airspace. “If you look at the environmental costs of what’s happening in Ukraine, that war is a catastrophe when it comes to carbon emissions,” James Appathurai, NATO’s deputy assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges, told Reuters. As the war continues to unfold in Ukraine, “the human catastrophe and the damage that’s being done to the country is overwhelming,” de Klerk said. Climate considerations will not be what’s occupying Ukrainians at the moment, he acknowledged, adding: “It’s a matter of survival.” But it is still important to analyze and document the often overlooked, longer-term climate impacts of the conflict, he said. “We want to show the world that the damage that Russia is doing with these acts of aggression is not only within Ukraine, but impacts the whole world through the additional emissions of greenhouse gases, which is everyone’s problem,” he said. Global commitments to keep warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels are already slipping out of reach. Rachel Kyte, dean of The Fletcher School at Tufts University, who was not involved in the research, said the report highlighted the crucial impact of war on the world’s ability to tackle climate change “The report raises important questions about including warfare in countries’ climate reporting and their transitions to net-zero and to greater resilience,” she told CNN. “For the whole of Europe, and the world, Ukraine’s reconstruction, following a just peace, must be green.” The war in Ukraine has shown the importance of understanding the climate impact of warfare, de Klerk said, adding: “It’s something that we simply cannot continue to ignore.”"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Dozens of heat records have fallen in Siberia, as temperatures climbed above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 Celsius). Despite only being early June, records are tumbling across parts of Siberia as extreme heat pushes into unusually high latitudes. Last Saturday, temperatures reached 37.9 degrees Celsius (100.2 Fahrenheit) in Jalturovosk, its hottest day in history, according to the climatologist Maximiliano Herrera, who tracks extreme temperatures across the globe. A slew of temperature records have fallen in Siberia since then. Several all-time heat records were broken on Wednesday, including in Baevo, which reached 39.6 degrees Celsius (103.3 Fahrenheit), and Barnaul, which hit 38.5 degrees Celsius (101.3 Fahrenheit). Some of these stations have between five and seven decades of temperature recordings, Herrera told CNN. “So we can say it’s really exceptional.” It’s the region’s “worst heat wave in history,” he posted on Twitter on Wednesday. And it looks set to get even worse. “Records keep falling today with again temperatures around 40 degrees Celsius,” Herrera told CNN on Thursday A scientific analysis may be done to asses how much influence climate change is having on this event, but we know that global warming is causing more extreme temperatures, especially in the higher latitudes. A particularly intense and prolonged heat wave in 2020, which saw the Arctic Siberian town of Verkhoyansk hit 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), would have been “almost impossible” without human-caused climate change, an analysis by a team of international scientists found. Siberia tends to see large monthly and yearly temperature fluctuations, but the last few decades have seen a strong warming trend. “Siberia is one of the fastest warming regions on the planet with hot extremes increasing in intensity,” Omar Baddour, chief of climate monitoring and policy services at the World Meteorological Organization, told CNN. The region “has seen some very intense heat waves,” said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. “These heat waves have major implications for people and nature and will continue to happen more frequently unless we rapidly cut emissions of greenhouse gases,” she told CNN. As wildfire season takes hold in the Northern Hemisphere, Siberia – along with Canada –  has also been grappling with significant and intense wildfires. Fired that raged across Russia’s Ural Mountains in May, killed at least 21 people. Extreme heat is likely to worsen wildfires. It’s not just Siberia that has seen record heat this week. It has spread across Central Asia. In early April, Turkmenistan saw temperatures of 42 degrees Celsius (107.6 Fahrenheit), which was “a world record for that latitude,” Herrera said. Since then the heat hasn’t stopped, with rolling heat waves gripping the region. On Wednesday, temperatures of more than 45 degrees Celsius (111.2 Fahrenheit) were recorded in China, 43 degrees Celsius (109.4 Fahrenheit) in Uzbekistan and 41 degrees Celsius (105.8) in Kazakhstan. It’s “a historic heat wave, which is rewriting world climatic history,” Herrera said on Twitter."

That’s a measly gain from 18% of firms in 2018. Climate scientists consider a 1.5 degree rise in the average global temperature a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically. Almost half, or 45%, of companies are aligned with warming of at least 2.7 degrees Celsius — a disastrous level of warming that could expose billions of people to dangerously hot conditions. That’s down from 61% in 2018. “Our data presents a clear message: we need to do more, and we need to do it quickly,” ESG Book CEO Daniel Klier said. “Without a fundamental change in the way the global economy operates, it’s not obvious how we see a significant shift.” The report is the latest in a string of evidence that the world is way off track to reach its climate goals. At the same time, major polluters such as Shell and BP                              (BP) are shifting their focus back to fossil fuel production following a year of bumper profits helped by soaring oil and gas prices. In its analysis, ESG Book assigned “temperature scores” to companies based on publicly reported emission data and factors such as emission reduction targets to determine firms’ contribution to global climate goals. The analysis covered companies with a market value of at least $10 billion in the United States, the United Kingdom, China, India and the European Union. It accounted for direct emissions from operations as well as indirect emissions from use of the companies’ products. This is particularly important for oil and gas firms as most of their emissions are generated from the burning of their products such as gasoline and jet fuel. In the UK, India and the EU, the number of companies with emission reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement has barely budged since 2018. Progress in the United States and China has been better, although off a lower base. In the United States, 20% of companies are Paris-aligned, up from 11% in 2018. In China, 12% are Paris-aligned, compared with just 3% five years ago. “The encouraging thing is we know what levers to pull, and a lot of these companies are now much more active. But as the data shows, we’re not necessarily all moving at the right pace,” Klier told CNN. In his view, a combination of more stringent government policies, changes to consumer behavior and technological breakthroughs will be required to bring about a meaningful shift in the current climate trajectory. Institutional investors, such as pension funds, also have an important role to play in directing more capital toward renewable technologies, he said. There are signs this money flow is gathering pace. According to the International Energy Agency, investment in solar power is set to overtake investment in oil production for the first time this year. “For every dollar invested in fossil fuels, about $1.7 are now going into clean energy. Five years ago, this ratio was one-to-one,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a report last month. Still, slightly more than $1 trillion is expected to flow toward oil, gas and coal this year, significantly above the level consistent with the world reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, the IEA said. There is now a 66% chance the planet’s temperature will rise above the 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming for at least one year in the next five years, the World Meteorological Organization said in a report in May. While that would only be a temporary breach, it would be the clearest signal yet of how quickly climate change is accelerating, leading to a rapid rise in sea levels, more extreme weather and the demise of vital ecosystems, the group said."

","Rachel Ramirez and Nicquel Terry Ellis, CNN","Avni Pravin did not have asthma growing up. But at the age of 30, Pravin says she now has trouble breathing. While she has not yet been officially diagnosed with asthma, she said her doctor has prescribed her an inhaler. “The reason I felt so affected earlier (was because) being outside, (I felt) that familiar tightness in my chest,” Pravin, a deputy director for Alliance for a Green Economy, told CNN on Thursday after speaking at a rally in Manhattan with other climate activists under the backdrop of New York’s hazy skies. “There were lots of folks who were walking from construction jobs and just day-to-day activities that they can’t avoid.” “I just was really having this moment of feeling extremely fed up with legislators that don’t want to take action,” she added. As wildfires in Canada continue to push toxic smoke toward the eastern US, environmental justice activists in New York are pleading for their state lawmakers to pass climate change legislation that would essentially limit new methane gas hookups. This week’s hazardous air is only exacerbating health risks in vulnerable Black and brown communities, activists say. The dangerous air conditions are expected to slowly improve heading into the weekend for millions of people in New York, Washington, DC, and surrounding areas. But for many Black and brown people in low-income communities, activists say air pollution is a problem they already face every day. People of color are disproportionately exposed to air pollution from industry, gas-powered vehicles, construction and other sources, according to a 2021 study that analyzed government air pollution and census data. In a separate study, researchers found that Black people breathe 56% more pollution than they cause, whereas White people breathe 17% less population than they make — underscoring the dire environmental disparity that exists across marginalized groups. Victoria Sanders, a research analyst for the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance, said her organization is encouraging residents to wear masks and avoid going outside, however, she understands that many New Yorkers work front line, essential jobs. And research shows that Black and Latino Americans are overrepresented in essential jobs, such as warehouse workers. Many Black Americans also have pre-existing conditions related to poor air quality such as asthma, cardiovascular, respiratory and pulmonary issues, Sanders said. Asthma emergency room visits for adults and children are the highest in the New York neighborhoods of East Harlem, South Bronx and Central Harlem, with East Harlem up to 18 times higher than the richer, more predominantly White neighborhood of Greenwich Village, according to data from the New York health department. Asthma rates are also the highest in these same neighborhoods, as well as parts of Brooklyn, where Pravin lives. “We have a lot of Black and brown communities that are surrounded by power plants … large highways with a lot of traffic,” Sanders said. “So there is a lot of polluting infrastructure that has been interwoven into these communities and pushed into these communities so that wealthier communities wouldn’t have to deal with those issues.” In the South Bronx, a predominantly low-income neighborhood of color, residents see an annual average of 11 to 13 micrograms per cubic meter of fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, which is higher than the World Health Organization’s air quality guideline of just 5 micrograms. That same area also sees the city’s highest rate of emergency care visits for asthma as well as respiratory hospitalizations. “Climate change has led to drier conditions that make for a longer and more active wildfire fire season, and the smoke from these fires can contribute to a wide variety of adverse health impacts, from difficulty breathing and reduced lung function to heart attacks and even premature death,” Annie Carforo, climate justice campaigns manager at WE ACT for Environmental Justice, told CNN. “These are the same health issues we see from burning fossil fuels, such as natural gas, but many overlook or downplay this threat because you cannot see or smell this pollution as easily as you can with wildfire smoke.” “And the cumulative impacts of all of this pollution does greater harm to people of color, especially Black (people), as studies indicate that they are exposed to higher amounts of air pollution,” she added. Meanwhile, in Pravin’s Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick, she and other climate activists have been fighting against a natural gas pipeline that they say would bring more environmental and climate harms their way. Methane, the main component of natural gas used to fuel stoves and heat homes, has more than 80 times as much warming power as carbon dioxide in the first two decades it’s in the atmosphere. For that reason, scientists have narrowed in on slashing fossil fuels as a way to rapidly decrease planet-warming pollution. Several studies also have found that gas stoves are responsible for severe health conditions, including asthma. The wildfire smoke only adds to these underlying burdens, and it’s just among the most visible examples of those harms if the planet continues to warm. “This is such a wakeup call for people around the city,” Pravin said. “But for some folks that deal with respiratory disorders 24/7 year-round, or live in poorly ventilated housing, or deal with mold and asbestos in their homes, this is what they experience day to day.”"

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","The thick blanket of smoke over the Northeast and Midwest – funneling south from Canadian wildfires – is chock full of toxic pollutants that are harmful to everyone’s health. But unlike man-made pollution, wildfire smoke can’t be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, which is charged with protecting human health and the environment. The EPA and the landmark Clean Air Act treat wildfires as exceptional natural events – that is, events that aren’t caused by humans and don’t happen regularly. “You can’t say it’s illegal for lightning to hit a tree and catch it on fire,” said James Boylan, a top air quality official for Georgia’s Environmental Division, and a member of the EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. “It’s hard to regulate something that’s naturally occurring like wildfires.” But the human-caused climate crisis is stacking the deck in favor of larger and more frequent wildfires as temperatures rise, and has renewed the debate over regulation. The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee – a group of physicians, state environmental officials and academics who are tasked with advising the EPA on air quality – has written letters to EPA administrator Michael Regan asking the agency to take a harder look at whether wildfire smoke should be classified as a natural or exceptional event. “A lot of the (committee) members felt that is something EPA ought to reconsider and not exclude, especially with climate change and the more frequent fires,” committee member Dr. Mark Frampton, a pulmonary disease specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center, told CNN. “It’s certainly having adverse health effects on people.” Committee chair Lianne Sheppard, a public health professor at the University of Washington, said that while her committee’s recommendation doesn’t weigh in on whether wildfire smoke could or should be regulated, it emphasizes that raging fires are increasingly common. “Treating these as exceptional events, that implies they’re unusual. But they’re getting to be so common that from a protecting public health view that doesn’t make sense,” Sheppard told CNN. Other environmental experts called on the agency to stop classifying wildfires as natural events. “These things are clearly, according to some in the scientific community, linked to climate change. That’s linked to humans,” said Jonathan Skinner-Thompson, a former EPA attorney and a law professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. Experts say the task is extraordinarily tricky, made all the more difficult by the fact that the current smoke choking Northeast cities is coming from wildfires in another country. “There are some things we just can’t control,” Boylan said. “Unfortunately, there’s not a whole lot [to do] regulatory-wise besides greenhouse gas reductions. People just have to look after their own health and make smart decisions on days like this.” It’s up to individuals to heed air quality warnings and stay inside, not exercise outdoors and use masks to avoid inhaling toxic smoke, Boylan and Frampton said. If the EPA can’t regulate wildfire smoke altogether, experts said it can tweak regulations to make it easier for states and Native American tribes to perform prescribed burns – essentially, fighting fire with fire. Even though the EPA considers wildfires natural events, prescribed burns are categorized as human-caused, which means there are more regulatory hoops to jump through before initiating a prescribed burn, Skinner-Thompson said. “I get that tension there, but EPA and others have put out studies saying prescribed fire emissions health benefits outweigh the cost,” he added. Experts noted the EPA is issuing rules to address the underlying causes of human caused climate change – pollution from burning oil, gas, and coal. “By regulating greenhouse gases, in theory, that could reduce the number of wildfires, and EPA does have a number of initiatives for reducing greenhouse gases,” Boylan said. But ultimately, both are longterm solutions. For the EPA to make any significant changes to how it treats wildfire smoke, Congress would likely have to weigh in on the Clean Air Act. That could come with plenty of pitfalls of its own, according to Skinner-Thompson. “In light of the political climate today, I bet both sides would like to amend the Clean Air Act and update it,” he said, adding, “They’re going to have very little appetite for consensus changes to the Clean Air Act to address wildfires.” Western lawmakers – who represent the states with the largest wildfire threat – said watching smoke fill Washington, DC, this week was concerning – but also gave them hope that more could be done to prevent and fight fires. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, a Democrat, said the smoke enveloping DC could bring more urgency and understanding on wildfires from his East Coast colleagues. “I wouldn’t wish it on anybody, but a couple years ago when we had the smoke from the California fires, it made everybody pay attention here in a way that they didn’t,” Bennet told CNN. “I hope we’ll act as a result of this.” “We have to recognize that given climate change, we’re going to have more of these fires,” Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah told CNN. “The way we’ve addressed them in the past is going to be insufficient for the future.”"

","Heather Chen, CNN","When the temperature soared to 99 degrees Fahrenheit last month, Singapore resident Chee Kuan Chew saw just one option: cancel all plans and stay indoors in air-conditioned comfort. “You can’t survive without air con in Singapore,” Chee said. “It’s impossible with the heat.” The 20-year-old university student lives with his family in a four-bedroom flat in Ang Mo Kio, a bustling district that made headlines in the Southeast Asian city state when its temperatures hit a 40-year high in a recent heat wave. Thankfully, Chee said, his home has five air conditioners – one in each bedroom and a larger unit in the living room. “I drank plenty of water, took cold showers and kept the air conditioning on for the entire weekend. That’s my way of managing the heat,” Chee said. Taking solace in air conditioning in Singapore is hardly unreasonable behavior. Situated roughly 85 miles north of the equator, the island nation is famously hot and humid, with temperatures that stretch into the 80s year-round – a climate that has helped make it one of the most air-conditioned countries in the world, with more units per capita than any of its Southeast Asian neighbors. Indeed, in this city, air conditioning has become almost a way of life. An office or mall without it is near unthinkable; 99% of private condominiums are air conditioned, as are the majority of public housing apartments. Lee Kuan Yew, the country’s founding prime minister, once called air conditioning “the greatest invention of the 20th century” and credited it for helping to transform the island from a backwater British colony into one of the world’s pre-eminent financial centers (one that today also enjoys some of the world’s highest per capita wages). But Singapore’s love affair with air conditioning has an enormous cost. It has trapped a nation already hot – and getting hotter – in what experts describe as a “dangerous, vicious cycle.” It’s a climate change Catch 22 paradox that faces all nations which rely on air conditioning to make life just that little bit more tolerable. Put simply: the warmer the world gets, the more people turn to their air conditioners. And the more they turn to their air conditioners, the warmer the world gets. Compared to gas guzzling cars and flatulent cows, air conditioners often fly under the radar when it comes to most media coverage of global warming culprits. But the machines are a potent force in accelerating climate change. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has estimated that – if not reined in – air conditioning-related greenhouse gas emissions could account for up to a 0.5 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures by the end of the century. Their effect on global warming is two-fold. Firstly, like refrigerators, many air conditioners today use a class of coolants called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are harmful greenhouse gases. Secondly, and perhaps ultimately even more problematically, air conditioners tend to use large amounts of electricity, generated by the burning of fossil fuels. According to the International Energy Agency, air conditioners and electric fans account for about 10% of all global electricity consumption. As a relatively compact nation, Singapore – with a population of about 5.4 million and an area a little smaller than New York City – contributes just a fraction of the HFCs and electricity demand that help drive global warming. Even with its high per capita usage, its total emissions are dwarfed by those of Japan and the United States, for example, where about 90% of households use air conditioning according to the WEF. Still, that doesn’t mean Singapore won’t suffer the consequences of a warming world just as much. And as an already hot nation that is heating up fast, it has less leeway than some others before temperatures become simply intolerable. According to government data released in 2019, the city state has been heating up twice as fast as the rest of the globe over the past six decades. Maximum daily temperatures could also reach highs of 37 degrees Celsius by 2100, officials warned. But rising temperatures in Singapore are not just about global warming. They are also caused by the Urban Heat Island effect, in which highly urbanized areas experience higher temperatures than their surrounding locales. The effect is caused by urban structures such as buildings, roads and vehicles trapping and releasing heat into the environment, especially at night, and is particularly pronounced in highly developed and relatively densely packed places like Singapore. It is made worse by the waste heat generated in cities by vehicles, factories and air conditioners, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Matthias Roth, a professor at the National University of Singapore who specializes in the subject, said that Singapore’s recent temperature rise was largely the result of a combination of background global warming and the Urban Heat Island effect. While he cautioned it was difficult to quantify the exact contribution of heat emissions from air conditioning on the Urban Heat Island effect, he said that “in selected commercial areas with much human activity and traffic, as well as tall, multi-story buildings closely spaced together and using air conditioning… this local warming can perhaps contribute 1 to 2 degrees Celsius to the environment.” While Roth noted these areas were “generally small and low in numbers and therefore would not significantly affect the average air temperature across the entire city,” he also pointed out that air conditioners are “not very energy efficient and when used in large numbers and often on a continuous basis, they can make up a large part of the energy consumption in hot places.” In some ways, how much of the temperature rise is caused by global warming and how much by the Urban Heat Island effect is a moot point, as either way the result is the same: people feel hotter. And the hotter people get, the more they use their air conditioning. Still, experts say there are ways to break the air conditioning doom-loop. Under the United Nations’ Kigali Amendment, agreed in 2016, many countries are phasing out HFCs – those harmful coolants used in many air conditioners – and replacing them with more climate friendly options, such as hydrofluoroolefins, or HFOs. Similar moves have worked in the past. The Kigali Amendment is an update to the Montreal Protocol that helped to phase out ozone-destroying Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, in the 1980s. Experts say there are also ways to cut down on the second problem with air conditioners – how much energy they use – by using other methods to keep cool. Abundant green spaces, shading, water bodies and clever ventilation are among the more sustainable “passive cooling strategies” suggested by Radhika Khosla, associate professor at Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and Environment. “While there are many instances when air conditioning is necessary, given the combination of hot temperatures and high humidity, what’s important is to always consider non-air con options first instead of making air conditioning the go-to solution for providing relief from extreme heat,” Khosla said. “Singapore, with its experience of living with high heat and humidity, must set an example for other countries in identifying, promoting and scaling sustainable cooling solutions,” she added. Fittingly, the same place that once heralded air conditioning as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century is also at the forefront of efforts to make it fit for purpose in the 21st. Singapore’s National Environment Agency (NEA) has banned the supply of high-GWP (global warming potential) refrigerants since October 2022 and says it encourages households to use fans rather than air conditioning where possible. The government agency has also advised residents to set timers and temperatures to no lower than 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) and service units regularly to maintain efficiency, it told CNN. Taking environmental concerns into account, one local university built what it says is the country’s “first net-zero energy building” – boasting naturally ventilated open spaces and an innovative “hybrid cooling system supplying 100 per cent fresh pre-cooled air.” Operational since 2019, the six-story SDE 4 building at the National University of Singapore’s School of Design and Environment campus is testament to how thermal comfort “did not have to come at the expense of the environment,” its architects told CNN. “We worked hard to ensure that it would be a net-zero building,” deputy dean Heng Chye Kiang said. Here, ceiling fans are used as alternatives to AC units. Smart senors measure and manage variables from temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide to air particles, light and sound to “further drive down energy consumption.” “We hope it will inspire other buildings and designers to achieve the same and reduce energy usage in the fight against climate change,” the school said. Heng added that after some years of operation, the building had turned out to be “energy positive” – producing more energy than it consumes – “by a large margin.” In other words, amid a troubling paradox, there’s some positive energy, too."

She is also a lecturer at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. She lives in Arlington, Virginia. The views expressed in this essay are her own. Read more opinion at CNN. End-of-year performances, class parties, teacher gifts, camp schedules, last day of school pictures: for parents across the country, the to-do lists right now are long, and they come with a mixture of emotions. There’s gratitude for another school year completed, but sadness in seeing your child getting yet another year older and closer to that dreaded moment when they will be moving away from home. There’s also excitement for the lazy days of summer, hearing the jingle of the ice cream truck or playing in the splash zone at the park. This year, those feelings are further clouded by the smoggy haze that shrouded much of the Northeast this week and threw many end-of-year celebrations into flux. On Wednesday, as usual, my second grader asked Alexa for the weather. Alexa replied, “By the way, there’s an air quality alert in effect.” I didn’t need Alexa to inform me of this; stepping outside in Washington, DC, the smoke was visible in the air, coming all the way from wildfires in Canada. I wondered if it was safe for my three children to breathe. Over the past few days – and indeed over the past few years – I’ve noticed two new emotions have crept in: dread and guilt. I feel dread knowing that the next few months will be marked by moments of extreme weather — around the country and the world — that will likely be unprecedented. This extreme weather, which will only get worse each year, will surely become a normal part of how children experience summer. Will it be another heat dome over the Pacific Northwest? Flooding in Kentucky? Fires in California? Something in Europe or Pakistan? This summer, will extreme weather hit closer to home? We won’t know for sure what it will be or where, but we can predict that these extreme weather events are becoming more common. I got an email from my kids’ school this past week: “Weather Notice: Code Red Air Quality.” All outdoor activities and play were canceled. In April, the Environmental Protection Agency released a report highlighting the health impacts of climate change on children and youth: Increasing rates of asthma, worse allergies, lost learning and more risk of displacement. Poor air quality, in particular, affects child brain development and mental health. My guilt sets in. This is the reality of our children’s lives, and we, collectively as adult humans, are responsible. Our greenhouse gas emissions — largely from burning fossil fuels for energy, transportation, manufacturing, buildings and the clearing of land for agriculture — are changing our atmosphere. Our atmosphere acts like a heat-trapping blanket, which has created the perfect conditions for a stable environment in which humans can thrive. But we have been changing the material of that blanket from a quilt to a heavy comforter, trapping more heat and destabilizing our climate. These moments of extreme weather will become more typical, more intense and more destructive. I grew up with an underlying assumption of what summer might entail. My children will grow up needing to process and adapt to the reality that summer might bring with it dangerous weather and the inability to play, carefree, outside. So, what can we do? As a society, we have a responsibility to prepare our children for climate instability. And we must do our part now to reduce our emissions and adapt. This can start at home and in our communities. Katharine Hayhoe, a leading climate scientist suggests one of the most important things we can do about climate change: talk about it. This includes conversations with our kids. When I picked up my daughter from preschool on Wednesday, she said, “Mommy, we didn’t have recess because of wildfires! Is it because of our Earth blanket?” Yes. We talk about what we can do to adapt: stay inside for recess and reschedule the school’s field day. She said she noticed her teacher wearing a mask. My second grader added, “And we can get power from the sun, compost and walk instead of drive!” We haven’t thought about this as a singular “climate change talk,” but rather as part of how we talk — how we try to help them make sense of the world. We make it a mission to always be connected to solutions. We can also show kids that we are working to address the problem through our actions. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provide unprecedented opportunities to advance solutions in our homes, schools and communities. The nonprofit Rewiring America created an IRA Savings Calculator, which explains how much you can save in your home with the tax credits available. A family of four in Arlington, Virginia, making $125,000 per year can save up to $7,500 off an electric vehicle, up to $2,000 for a heat pump air conditioner and 30% off rooftop solar installation, to name a few. While not all parents can make changes in their home, most could advocate for change at their kids’ schools. The organization I lead, This Is Planet Ed at the Aspen Institute, in partnership with National Parent Teacher Association and Mothers Out Front, created an advocacy toolkit to help. Schools can get up to $40,000 off an electric school bus and potentially up to 50% off the cost of adding solar. Driving home, my fourth grader sang a Taylor Swift song. The line “Or it’s gonna go down in flames” hit me and my stomach dropped. The only way to prevent the dread and guilt from taking over is by taking action. For all our kids, it’s time we prioritize their future and help ensure they can thrive in a changing climate."

But there are two caveats.                                             ","Aya Elamroussi and Holly Yan, CNN","Major US cities trapped under a thick, orange blanket of smog this week will soon get a reprieve, as the Canadian wildfires spewing noxious fumes across the border are easing up. Fire activity in the province of Quebec has improved, and the area covered by smoke is now just 7% of what it was last week. Slightly cooler temperatures and higher humidity in Canada mean less smoke billowing across the border. But there are two big caveats: It’s still early in the Canadian fire season, meaning more wildfires could flare up this summer. And several US states are still suffering poor air quality, which could cause health problems. “Smoke from Canadian wildfires continues to be transported south by winds into the U.S. resulting in moderate to unhealthy air quality across parts of the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Ohio Valley, and Midwest on Friday,” the National Weather Service said. “Some improvement is expected this weekend.” While the worst has passed for most of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, potentially harmful air pollutants in New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, DC, are expected to linger Friday before slowly clearing over the next several days. Philadelphia’s air quality index exceeded 150 early Friday, making it “unhealthy,” according to the monitoring website AirNow. New York City’s air quality index was below 150 early Friday and deemed “unhealthy for sensitive groups.” The oppressive smoke this week has postponed professional sports games, grounded flights due to poor visibility, shuttered zoos and beaches and forced many to mask up outdoors. Climate experts have warned such events are becoming more frequent due to human-induced climate change. About 50 million people across several Midwest and East Coast states were under air quality alerts early Friday, but the number could change as conditions improve in some areas. Here’s what to expect: • Entire states’ air quality is compromised: All of Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Indiana are under air quality alerts, as well as parts of Ohio, Michigan, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina. • Schools go remote: Public schools in New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, DC, have remote learning Friday to help reduce exposure to air toxins. • New York City will improve: After having the world’s worst air quality multiple times this week, according to IQAir, the Big Apple could see some “significant improvement,” Mayor Eric Adams said Thursday. “As of right now, the smoke models are not indicating another large plume over the city,” Adams said, though he urged people to mask well when outside. • Evacuated Canadians can go home: Most of the Halifax residents evacuated because of the wildfires will be allowed to return home Friday, Mayor Mike Savage said. About 16,000 people fled their homes during the height of the wildfire evacuations, and about 4,100 remain evacuated. • Firefighters will get help: New York state plans to send forest rangers to help fight the wildfires in Quebec Friday, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. Federal resources have also been deployed, the White House has said. Scientists warn such routine-altering weather events are more likely to continue disrupting daily life as the planet warms, creating the ideal environment for more severe and frequent wildfires. When flames burn, the smoke can travel thousands of miles, which puts millions more people in harm’s way. Wildfire smoke is particularly dangerous because it contains tiny particulate matter, or PM2.5, the tiniest of pollutants. When inhaled, it can move deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources including the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires. Such smoke has been linked to several health complications including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses. CNN’s Jennifer Gray, Brandon Miller, Robert Shackelford, Andrea Cambron, Laura Ly, Caroll Alvarado, Kristina Sgueglia, Sara Smart and Jen Christensen contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Deep ocean water in the Antarctic is heating up and shrinking, with potentially far-reaching consequences for climate change and deep ocean ecosystems, according to a report. “Antarctic bottom water” is the coldest, saltiest water on the planet. These waters play a crucial role in the ocean’s ability to act as a buffer against climate change by absorbing excess heat and human-caused carbon pollution. They also circulate nutrients across the ocean. But in the Weddell Sea, located east of the Antarctic Peninsula, this vital water mass is in decline, due to long-term changes in winds and sea ice, according to the study published Monday by the British Antarctic Survey. Scientists used decades of data taken by ships as well as from satellites to assess the volume, temperature and saltiness of this slice of deep Antarctic Ocean. “Some of these sections were first visited as far back as 1989, making them some of the most comprehensively sampled regions in the Weddell Sea,” Povl Abrahamsen, a physical oceanographer at BAS and co-author, said in a statement. They found that the volume of the cold bottom waters has shrunk by more than 20% over the past three decades. They also found that ocean waters deeper than 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) have warmed four times faster than the rest of the global ocean. “We used to think that changes in the deep ocean could only occur over centuries. But these key observations from the Weddell Sea show that changes in the dark abyss can take place over just a few decades,” Alessandro Silvano from the University of Southampton in the UK, a co-author of the study, said in a statement. The reason these deep waters are shrinking is down to changes in sea ice formation caused by weakening winds, the study found. Stronger winds tend to push ice away from the ice shelf, which leaves areas of water open for more ice to form. Weaker winds have meant these gaps are smaller, slowing sea ice creation, according to the study. New sea ice is vital to create the Weddell Sea’s very cold, salty water. As the water freezes, it pushes out salt and as salty water is denser, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. The changes in these deep waters can have far-reaching consequences. They are a vital part of global ocean circulation, transporting human-caused carbon pollution into the deep ocean where it remains for centuries, said Silvano. If this deep circulation weakens, “less carbon can be absorbed by the deep ocean, limiting the ability of the ocean to mitigate global warming,” Silvano told CNN. Oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the world’s excess heat since the 1970s and absorb almost a third of human-produced carbon pollution. This cold, dense water also has a vital role in supplying oxygen to deep ocean waters. How and whether deep ecosystems could adapt to less oxygen “is unclear,” added Silvano. Holly Ayres, a researcher at the department of meteorology at Reading University in the UK who was not involved in the study, said the BAS research is a step forward in our knowledge about  deep ocean water in the Antarctic. “To have combined decades of ship-based observations and satellite data is a big leap in our understanding of the formation process, and may be helpful in our understanding of how Antarctic bottom water will form in the future,” Ayres told CNN. While the changes the study identified are the result of natural climate variability, climate change is also having an impact on Antarctica’s deep waters. In a March study, scientists found that melting ice is diluting the saltiness of the ocean and slowing down the the circulation of deep ocean water in the Antarctic. Failure to limit planet-heating pollution could lead to the collapse of the circulation of deep ocean water, with potentially devastating consequences for the climate and marine life, the report found. BAS new study is “an early warning” Shenjie Zhou, an oceanographer at BAS and lead author of the study, told CNN. “The ongoing changes in the deep water layer in the Antarctic are already happening and it’s not heading in the direction that we want.”"

But the rate of growth will “shrivel” from the current 2.4 million barrels per day to just 400,000 in five years’ time. The global thirst for oil is likely to be affected by stricter fuel efficiency standards, growth in the electric vehicle market and structural changes to economies around the world, according to the agency. The IEA’s latest forecasts update its prediction in October that demand for oil would plateau by the mid-2030s. In that report, the Paris-based agency said the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year had hastened the global transition to cleaner forms of energy. It also expected investments in low-carbon energy worldwide to increase to $2 trillion a year until the end of the current decade — up 50% from October’s level. Still, some of the world’s biggest energy producers — riding high after a year of soaring prices for their products and eye-watering profits — are planning to invest more in oil and gas output. The IEA said it expected investment in oil and gas exploration and production to hit $528 billion in 2023, its highest level since 2015 and an 11% increase on last year’s figure. Shell, which posted a record $40 billion in profit last year, announced Wednesday that it planned to keep its oil output steady until 2030, revising an earlier plan to cut production by between 1% and 2% a year over that period. A Shell spokesperson told CNN that its goal to reduce oil production by as much as 20% — against its 2019 production baseline — by the end of the decade “had not changed,” but that it had met the target early, thanks, in large part, to the sale of parts of its oil business. The company also announced Wednesday that it would hike its shareholder dividend by 15% and spend at least $5 billion buying back its own shares over the second half of the year. Its shares rose 1.6% on Wednesday afternoon. BP                              (BP), which also reported a record profit of $28 billion in 2022, announced earlier this year that it would scale back its targets to cut production. BP now plans to slash oil output by 25% by 2030 from 2019 levels, whereas it previously aimed to cut output by 40% against this benchmark. Both Shell and BP still plan to become net-zero emissions businesses by 2050. The IEA’s Birol said oil companies needed to “pay careful attention” to the agency’s latest forecasts. “Oil producers need to… calibrate their investment decisions to ensure an orderly [energy] transition,” he said."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Droughts, storms, wildfires and heat waves: Extreme weather around the world is becoming more intense and more frequent. The toll is huge and mounting, with lives lost, homes destroyed, livelihoods stolen and economies upended. The extreme events are happening against the backdrop of a very fast-warming climate. The world is already 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in preindustrial times, and the next five years are predicted to be the hottest on record. People often want to know if an extreme weather event happened because of climate change, said Friederike Otto, climate scientist and co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative. But it is not a simple question. “You can’t answer this with yes or no,” she told journalists at a briefing last week. It is because climate change alters the likelihood and intensity of extreme events, she said. Otto and other scientists are using a scientific technique to transform our understanding of how this dynamic plays out. And, more often than not, they are finding the clear fingerprints of climate change on extreme weather events. Called “attribution,” the method involves analyzing real world observations as well as climate models to establish whether a particular extreme event could have happened in a world without global heating. While attribution studies are not done for every extreme weather event, they help bring home the realities of the direct and immediate damage the climate crisis is doing to people’s lives, which scientists say will only get worse if the world continues to pump out planet-warming pollution. “We’re always going to have extreme weather, but if we keep driving in this direction, we’re gonna have a lot of extreme weather,” said Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado-Boulder. From intense heat and record-breaking drought, to severe storms fueled by hotter air and oceans, here are 10 disasters showing the devastating impacts of the human-caused climate crisis. In some cases, the impacts of climate change are so clear and so overwhelming, scientists conclude extreme weather events would have been all but impossible without global warming. These six events fit the category: Siberian heat wave, 2020 In 2020, a prolonged, unprecedented heat wave seared one of the coldest places on Earth, triggering widespread wildfires. Temperatures in the small Siberian town of Verkhoyansk hit 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), the warmest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic. The punishing heat, which spanned from January to June and pushed temperatures 5 degrees Celsius above average, would have been “almost impossible” in a climate not warmed by carbon pollution, according to rapid attribution study by the attribution initiative. The heat wave was made at least 600 times more likely by the climate crisis, the scientists concluded, finding such prolonged Arctic heat would happen less than once every 80,000 years without human-induced climate change. Andrew Ciavarella, lead author of the research and senior detection and attribution scientist at the UK’s Met Office, called the findings “truly staggering.” Pacific Northwest heat wave, 2021 The end of June 2021 was unforgettable for parts of the Pacific Northwest. A historic heat wave killed hundreds, triggered devastating fires and worsened an already unrelenting drought in parts of the region. Oregon, Washington, and western provinces of Canada including British Columbia, saw record-shattering temperatures, which reached as high as 121.3 degrees Fahrenheit (49.6 Celsius) in the Canadian village of Lytton, which subsequently was burned down by a wildfire. According to an analysis by more than two dozen scientists at the attribution initiative, the June heat wave “would have been virtually impossible” without the influence of human-caused climate change. “Our results provide a strong warning: Our rapidly warming climate is bringing us into uncharted territory that has significant consequences for health, well-being, and livelihoods,” the authors wrote. Northern Hemisphere drought, 2022 From North America to Europe to China, vast swaths of the Northern Hemisphere experienced extreme drought in the summer of 2022, straining water resources, ruining crops, and priming the landscape for perilous wildfires. Attribution initiative scientists concluded climate change made these drought conditions at least 20 times more likely. The soaring temperatures would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change, the analysis also found. The Western US saw shrunken water levels, worsening drought, and fallowed farmland. And China and Europe saw thousands of heat-related deaths. The heat and drought in Europe claimed least at 15,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. “The 2022 Northern Hemisphere summer is a good example of how extreme events caused by climate change can also unfold over large regions in longer periods of time,” Otto said. Horn of Africa drought, 2020-2023 A three-year drought in the Horn of Africa, one of the world’s most impoverished regions, has caused crops to wither, water to disappear, and livestock to starve in large parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. The drought, which is the worst in 40 years, has had a catastrophic human impact, killing tens of thousands of people and leaving more than 20 million facing acute food insecurity. It would not have happened without climate change, which made it at least 100 times more likely, according to a rapid attribution analysis. “Almost half of the country’s population is affected, over 3 million people are displaced,” Mamunur Rahman Malik, the Somalia representative for the World Health Organization, told CNN in April. “The country continues to pay the price of global warming and climate change,” he added. Mediterranean heat, 2023 In April, a blistering heat wave with temperatures far more typical of late summer swept Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Algeria, exacerbating a severe drought that had already left crops dry and drained critical water resources. Human-caused global heating made the western Mediterranean heat wave at least 100 times more likely. Scientists said the heat, which exceeded 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit (40.6 Celsius) in parts of Morocco, would have been “almost impossible without climate change.” Before the Earth warmed, such an intense event would be expected only once in 40,000 years, the scientists found. Extreme heat in South Asia, 2023 Large parts of South Asia faced a brutal heat wave in April. Countries including Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, India and Bangladesh all saw new all-time temperature records. In Thailand, temperatures topped 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 Celsius) for the first time ever, but humidity meant temperatures felt much higher. In Thailand and Laos, the humid heat wave would have been “virtually impossible” without the climate crisis, according to attribution initiative scientists. While the heat in India and Bangladesh was made at least 30 times more likely by human-caused climate change, the same analysis found. For other extreme weather events, the effect of the human-caused climate crisis is to make them more likely or more severe: Australia Black Summer fires, 2019-2020 Australia experienced months of blood-red skies and thick gray smoke in the summer of 2019 to 2020, as devastating wildfires swept many parts of the country. Stark images emerged of firefighters rescuing koalas and people pouring water on the burned hands of kangaroos. The fires, which tore through around 50 million acres, were linked to more than 400 deaths, with thousands admitted to the hospital due to wildfire smoke-related conditions. Nearly three billion animals were either killed or displaced by the bush fires. Human-caused climate change made the conditions leading to the severe fires at least 30% more likely, a World Weather Attribution analysis found. Western US drought, 2020-2023 The Western United States has faced its worst drought in centuries over the past few years, fueling devastating wildfires and triggering water shortages. In California, the summer of 2021 saw the most extreme drought on record for the state. A hydroelectric power plant at Lake Oroville, the state’s second-largest reservoir, was forced to shut down due to low water levels for the first time since it opened in 1967. Meanwhile, two of the country’s largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, dropped so low, government officials imposed unprecedented water cuts for the states of Nevada and Arizona, as well as in Mexico. A study from the journal Nature Climate Change found the period from 2000 to 2021 was the driest the West has ever been in 1,200 years, noting human-caused climate change made the megadrought 72% worse. Hurricane Ian, 2022 When Hurricane Ian swept across the Caribbean and into Florida in 2022, it left a trail of destruction in its wake, killing more than 100 people and caused roughly $65 billion of damage. Extreme rainfall caused huge amounts of damage and scientists say it was made more intense by global heating. The hurricane was at least 10% wetter because of climate change, according to an analysis by scientists at Stony Brook University and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Pakistan floods, 2022 Major flooding caused by record monsoon rains claimed the lives of nearly 1,500 people during the summer of 2022, with millions more affected by clean water and food shortages. The floods left a third of Pakistan underwater. The country received more than three times its usual rainfall in August, making it the wettest August since 1961. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the Pakistani people were facing “a monsoon on steroids.” Climate change made the rainfall in the hard-hit provinces of Sindh and Balochistan 50% more intense than it would have been had the climate not warmed by 1.2 degrees Celsius, an attribution initiative study found."

","Bill Weir, CNN Chief Climate Correspondent","It’s a Big Sky story fit for a big screen. On one side: 16 kids from ranches, reservations and tourist boomtowns across Montana – a group of wannabe climate avengers ranging in age from 5 to 22 and assembled to fight for a livable planet. On the other side: Montana’s governor, attorney general and the Republican supermajorities of both houses, who may have lost a three-year fight to kill the nation’s first constitutional climate case before it hit court, but are still determined to let oil, gas and coal keep flowing for generations. The setting is a small courtroom in Helena and the whole plot pivots around the Montana constitution, widely considered the greenest in the nation. “The state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations,” reads Article 9, and those pivotal words “clean and healthful environment” are also guaranteed separately in the state’s bill of rights. “This case is about the equal rights of children,” attorney Roger Sullivan began in his opening argument in Held vs. Montana this week, “and their need now for extraordinary protection from the extraordinary dangers of fossil fuel pollution and climate crisis that their state government is exposing them to.” In the half-century since the environmental promises were added to the constitution, the Treasure State has never rejected a fossil fuel project for potential harm to air or water.  And this spring, after a county judge cited the constitution in pulling the permit of a new gas-fired power plant, state leaders quickly crafted House Bill 971 to make it illegal for any state agency to analyze climate impacts when assessing large projects, like power plants, that need environmental review. In a region full of ranchers and farmers who depend on stable weather and the kind of National Park beauty that draws millions of outdoor enthusiasts a year, the bill created the most buzz by far in the May legislative session, drawing more than 1,000 comments. But while 95% of the comments were opposed, according to a legislature count, the bill passed. “Skinny cows and dead cattle,” Rikki Held said, when asked how drought changed her family’s Broadus ranch. Since she was the only plaintiff of legal age when the suit was filed, the historic case bears her name. Now finally on the stand, she described with emotion what it was like to work through smoke and ash on 110°F days.  “We have the technology and knowledge,” said Held, now an environmental science major at Colorado College. “We just need empathy and willingness to do the right thing.” One after another, her fellow plaintiffs have testified how the effects of a warming planet are already causing them physical, emotional and financial pain. “You know, it’s really scary seeing what you care for disappear right in front of your eyes,” said Sariel, a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, after describing how the loss of consistent snow affects everything from native plants to tribal traditions. “Do you believe the state of Montana has a responsibility to protect this land for you?” a lawyer asked Sariel, who, like the other children who were under 18 when the case was filed, is being referred to only by her first name.  “Yes, I do,” she replied in a soft voice. “It’s not only written in our constitution, an inherent right to a healthy land and environment, but it’s also just about being a decent person.” “During the course of this trial, the court will hear lots of emotions,” Montana Assistant Attorney General Michael Russell said in his opening argument. “Lots of assumptions, accusations, speculation, prognostication … including sweeping, dramatic assertions of doom that awaits us all.” But this case is “far more boring,” Russell argued, and is little more than a show trial over statutes “devoid of any regulatory authority.” Montana’s population of 1.1 million is “simply too minuscule to make any difference in climate change,” Russell told the court, “which is a global issue that effectively relegates Montana’s role to that of a spectator.” Attorneys for the plaintiffs have tried to poke holes in this argument, pointing out Montana’s outsized energy footprint. On Thursday, Peter Erickson, a greenhouse gas emissions expert and witness for the plaintiffs, pointed out Montana has the sixth largest per-capita energy-related CO2 emissions in the nation – behind other big energy-producing states like Wyoming, West Virginia and Louisiana. “It’s significant. It’s disproportionately large, given Montana’s population,” Erickson said. While attorneys for the state objected when Rikki Held tried to connect her mental health to the climate crisis, they have largely saved cross-examination for the experts as the plaintiffs lay out their case. “If the judge ordered that we stop using fossil fuels in Montana would it get us to the point where these plaintiffs are no longer being harmed in your opinion?” Mark Stermitz, an attorney for the state, asked Steven Running, professor emeritus of ecosystem and conservation sciences at the University of Montana. “We can’t tell in advance,” said Running, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 as one of the scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “Because what has been shown in history over and over and over again is when a significant social movement is needed, it often is started by one or two or three people.” The trial is set to conclude on June 23 and is being heard before Judge Kathy Seeley, with no jury. While Seeley has no power to shut down fossil fuel use or order the end of new extraction permits, a ruling against Montana could help kill the new law outlawing climate impact analysis and set a powerful precedent for similar cases winding their ways through the courts. “I think we’re really at a tipping point right now,” Our Children’s Trust attorney Nate Bellinger told CNN. The Oregon-based legal nonprofit has filed similar actions in all 50 states and will go to trial in September with a group of young Hawaiians suing their state’s transportation department, claiming it is allowing rampant tailpipe pollution. The group also supports the 21 young plaintiffs in Juliana vs. United States, who will get their day in federal court after amending their complaint that actions by the federal government have caused climate change and violated their constitutional rights. When the Ninth Circuit put the Juliana case back on track, 18 Republican-led states – including Montana – tried to intervene as defendants and take on the so-called Climate Kids but were rejected. It is likely the case will reach the US Supreme Court. Back in the Wild West days of 1889, Montana’s original constitution was written under the guidance of a copper baron named William Clark, who claimed that arsenic pollution from mining gave the women of Butte “a beautiful complexion.” But less than a century later, mining and logging had done obvious harm to the rivers, skies and mountainsides of “the last best place,” just as the movements for social change and environmental protection were sweeping the nation. This was the backdrop when in 1972, 100 Montanans from all walks of life gathered in the town of Last Chance Gulch to hammer out a new constitution with not a single active politician among them. Mae Nan Ellingson was the youngest delegate back then, and as the plaintiffs set out to establish the intent behind “a clean and healthful environment for present and future generations,” she became the first witness in Held vs. Montana. “It was important, I think, for this constitution to make it clear that citizens could enforce their right to a clean environment and not wait until the pollution or the damage had been done,” she testified. The Montana Supreme Court agreed with her in a 1999 ruling and the majority wrote, “Our constitution does not require that dead fish float on the surface of our state’s rivers and streams before its farsighted environmental protections can be invoked.” Regardless of the verdict, it is likely that Held vs. Montana will end up in Montana’s Supreme Court, but for plaintiffs like Claire Vlases who are too young to vote, that will be just fine. “I just recently graduated high school, but I think that’s something everyone knows is that we have three branches of government for a reason,” she said, sitting by the river that runs through her Bozeman yard.  “The judicial branch is there to keep a check on the other two branches. And that’s what we’re doing here.” CNN’s Ella Nilsen contributed to this story."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/16/world/concrete-carbon-emissions-researchers-working-to-make-it-greener-climate-scn-spc/index.html,Concrete is a huge source of carbon emissions. These researchers are working to make it greener,06-23-2023,                                                 Researchers around the world are coming up with ways to cut concrete’s carbon footprint.                                             ,"Mark Tutton, CNN","Our world is built of concrete. Durable and cheap, it’s the construction material of choice for buildings, bridges and tunnels. But its ubiquity means it has a huge environmental impact. Concrete is made from water mixed with aggregates like sand and gravel, bound together by cement – and it’s the cement that is the biggest contributor to its carbon footprint. Portland cement is the most common kind, and is produced by baking lime in a kiln. More than 4 billion tons of cement were produced in 2021, contributing 8% of global CO2 emissions, according to think tank Chatham House. With pressure on the construction industry to decarbonize, researchers around the world are looking for ways to make concrete greener. “Concrete is such a fantastic, reliable material that we’re really going to struggle to cut it out everywhere,” said Sam Draper, a PhD student at Imperial College London. “We can transition to timber buildings where possible, but a lot of our infrastructure needs concrete, and to make concrete we need some sort of cement.” Draper and fellow researcher Barney Shanks have come up with a way of making a cement that they say can produce carbon-neutral concrete. Their process begins with a common mineral called olivine, which they split into magnesium and silica. The silica is used to directly replace 35-40% of the Portland cement used in concrete, while the magnesium is combined with carbon dioxide (CO2) to make magnesium carbonate, which can be then used for construction materials including alternatives to clay-fired bricks and gypsum plasterboard. Because the CO2 used in the process can be captured from the waste flues of cement factories, which would otherwise have gone into the atmosphere, concrete made in this way is carbon neutral, says Draper, and the magnesium carbonate is a stable carbon store. “One of the really nice things about the construction industry from a carbon sequestration perspective is that it’s big and bulky, so you can store a lot of CO2 in there,” said Draper. “And things tend to be fairly permanent, so you’re able to get good, long-lived sequestration. Using waste CO2 to make fuels or something is nice, and it’s circular, but as soon as you burn that fuel, the CO2 is gone. The built environment gives you opportunities to really lock it in for a long time.” After beginning their testing in 2020, Draper and Shanks launched a company called Seratech in 2021. Now, they’re just a few weeks away from formally spinning out the company from Imperial College, and being able to raise private funds for a bigger pilot facility able to produce a few tons of cement a week. Draper says Seratech’s cement performs as well as “gold-standard” Portland cement, adding that this is vital for its acceptance by the construction industry. “For me, this is such a driver for these low-carbon technologies,” he said. “It has to look the same, it has to feel the same … it has to be identical, or people simply won’t use it in the real world. And I’m very happy to say I think we’ve achieved that pretty well.” Last year, the company won the Obel Award, an international prize that “promotes architecture in the service of both people and the planet.” Describing the winners, the Obel Award said: “Given the huge carbon footprint of the construction industry, Seratech’s process has the potential to significantly reduce embodied emissions globally and to support future low-carbon construction.” Draper acknowledges that the cement is very expensive at its current research stage, but says that when scaled up, costs will be comparable with Portland cement. He adds that Seratech plans to start testing the cement in real buildings by early 2025 and hopes to have a large-scale industrial pilot by 2027, capable of supplying multiple projects. Other startups are finding ways to store CO2 directly in concrete. CarbonCure injects captured CO2 into concrete as it’s mixed, where it reacts with cement to increase the strength of the concrete. As well as sequestering CO2, the company says this extra strength means the concrete can be made with less cement. Fellow Canadian company Carbicrete says it can replace cement entirely, by combining waste slag from steel production with carbon captured from industrial plants. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), researchers are working on a process to cut concrete’s carbon footprint while tackling another environmental problem. The UAE relies on the desalination of seawater for most of its drinking water, but the process produces salt water – called brine – as a byproduct, which is pumped back into the ocean, increasing its salinity, which can harm sea life. Kemal Celik, assistant professor of Civil and Urban Engineering at NYU Abu Dhabi, has found that the brine contains useful minerals, including high concentrations of magnesium. “What we are doing is using this reject brine from the desalination plant and applying very simple chemistry,” he said. His team has developed a process to separate the solid and liquid components of the brine, and then use the magnesium component to make a cement. “Magnesium-based cement is not a new type of cement … but the source of magnesium carbonates is usually from the mining industry,” explains Celik. Producing conventional magnesium-based cement requires heating and emits CO2, he says, adding that creating it from waste brine is cost-efficient and environmentally friendly. Celik says his research is currently at the proof-of-concept stage, working with 4,000 to 5,000 liters of brine per day, but he is looking to produce the material at a big enough scale to work with the construction industry. “I think the biggest challenge for us is the industry itself,” he explained. “The construction industry is one of the oldest industries and we might have some resistance to change the material that (it is) currently using. In that sense, we need to increase the awareness in the industry and the public.” But Celik is determined to rise to the challenge. “As a researcher, we have to serve the community. That’s why I’m so motivated with our research that could help the world a bit in terms of fighting climate change.” Adrian Lydon contributed to this report."

Unusually hot oceans. Record high levels of carbon pollution in the atmosphere and record low Antarctic ice. We’re only halfway through 2023 and so many climate records are being broken.                                             ,"Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Soaring temperatures. Unusually hot oceans. Record high levels of carbon pollution in the atmosphere and record low levels of Antarctic ice. We’re only halfway through 2023 and so many climate records are being broken, some scientists are sounding the alarm, fearing it could be a sign of a planet warming much more rapidly than expected. In a widely shared tweet, Brian McNoldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science, called rising ocean and air temperatures “totally bonkers.” He added, “people who look at this stuff routinely can’t believe their eyes. Something very weird is happening.” Other scientists have said while the records are alarming, they are not unexpected due to both the continued rise of planet-heating pollution and the arrival of the natural climate phenomenon El Niño, which has a global heating effect. Whether the broken records are a sign of climate change progressing beyond what climate the models predict, or are the outcome of the climate crisis unfolding as expected, they remain a very concerning signal of what’s to come, scientists said. “These changes are deeply disturbing because of what they mean for people this coming summer, and every summer after, until we cut our carbon emissions at a much faster pace than we’re currently doing,” Jennifer Marlon, research scientist at Yale School of the Environment, told CNN. The world is already 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in preindustrial times, and the next five years are predicted to be the hottest on record. “We’ve been saying this for a long time – as polar scientists and as climate scientists – we’ve been saying you can count on the next few decades to consistently get warmer,” Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado-Boulder, told CNN. “We’re not going to turn back until we actually do something about this.” Here are four charts showing just how record-breaking this year has already been, with the hottest months still to come. This year is shaping up to be one of the hottest yet, with global data showing temperatures spiking to unusually high levels. The first eleven days of June saw the highest temperatures on record for this time of year by a substantial margin, according to an analysis released Thursday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. It is also the first time global air temperatures during June exceeded preindustrial levels by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, the scientists found. Heat records are being broken across the world. In Canada, where an unusually stifling heat wave is blanketing much of the country, temperatures have broken multiple records. The heat has helped set the stage for “unprecedented,” early wildfires already burning an area about 15 times bigger than average for this time of the year and sending hazardous smoke into the United States. Several all-time heat records were also broken earlier this month in Siberia, as temperatures shot up above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Parts of Central America, as well as Texas and Louisiana are also facing blistering temperatures. And Puerto Rico experienced extreme heat this June, with temperatures feeling like more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Weather Service. Swaths of Southeast Asia have experienced their “harshest heat wave on record,” while record temperatures in China have killed animals and crops and sparked concerns about food security. “The current situation is bizarre,” Phil Reid with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, told CNN. “The strangest El Niño ever. How are you supposed to define or declare an El Niño when everywhere is hot?” Oceans are heating up to record levels and show no sign of stopping. Rising ocean surface temperatures began alarming scientists in March when they started to climb and then skyrocketed to reach record levels in April, leaving scientists scrambling to figure out why. Last month was the hottest May on record for the world’s oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s a pattern of warming that has been going on for years. In 2022, the world’s oceans broke heat records for the fourth year in a row. Climatologist Maximiliano Herrera, who closely tracks extreme temperatures around the globe, said he didn’t think the rapid warming would come so soon. “Even before El Niño was officially declared, the tropics and the oceans were already experiencing a very fast warming,” Herrera told CNN. “It was expected, yes,” he added. “But not as fast as it has been.” Ocean warming poses dire consequences, including coral bleaching, the die-off of marine life and rising sea levels. And while El Niño usually ushers in a less active Atlantic hurricane season, high ocean temperatures help fuel them, potentially negating or outweighing El Niño’s dampening effect. Antarctica’s sea ice is currently at record lows for this time of year, with some scientists concerned it is a further sign the climate crisis has arrived in this isolated region. In late February, Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent since records began in the 1970s, at 691,000 square miles. It’s “not just ‘barely a record low,’” Scambos told CNN at the time. “It’s on a very steep downward trend.” As the Antarctic has moved into its winter, and the sea ice has started to grow again, levels are still tracking at record low levels for this time of year. The decline is “truly exceptional and alarming,” Scambos said, underscoring Antarctica’s sea ice extent is roughly 386,000 square miles – about twice the area of California – below where it should be for this time of the year. “2023 is just heading off into crazy territory,” he said. Both Reid and Scambos said there is a link between this decline and the warm waters off the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Even a tenth of a degree of warming, they said, is enough to inhibit sea ice growth. The decline in sea ice also poses severe harm to the continent’s species, including penguins who rely on sea ice for feeding and hatching eggs. “Bottom line, the conditions the Antarctic system depends on to keep heat and ice and certain water types in their place are breaking down a little bit,” Scambos said. “It started with an unusual series of storms in 2016, but there’s been a persistent effect that is now leading to more heat being stirred up into the polar water layer, and that is stifling sea ice growth.” The levels of carbon dioxide in the air, which is released from the burning of fossil fuels, hit a record in May, scientists from NOAA and Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego reported early this month. The record of 424 parts per million continues “a steady climb further into territory not seen for millions of years,” the scientists noted in a statement. Carbon pollution levels, which fuel the climate crisis, are now more than 50% higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution began, NOAA has said. “Every year we see carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere increase as a direct result of human activity,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. “Every year, we see the impacts of climate change in the heat waves, droughts, flooding, wildfires and storms happening all around us.”"

In a speech in Washington after the endorsement, Biden called climate change “the only truly existential threat,” adding, “If we don’t meet the requirements that we’re looking at, we’re in real trouble.” Biden heavily courted climate and environmental justice groups during his 2020 campaign and has made combating climate change central to his governing agenda with announcements over the past few months on environmental justice initiatives and aggressive new rules to regulate planet-warming pollution from natural gas power plants. Some environmental groups and activists have expressed frustration over his administration’s approval of a major Alaska oil project earlier this year and more recently over the White House pushing for the Mountain Valley pipeline to be included in the debt ceiling package enacted earlier this month. On Monday, Biden will tour coastal wetland areas and discuss actions his administration has taken to alleviate the climate crisis and protect the environment during a visit to the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center and Preserve in Palo Alto, California, according to the White House official. As part of his remarks, which will be delivered alongside state, community and environmental justice leaders, the president will announce that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is launching a $575 million “Climate Resilience Regional Challenge,” which will help coastal and Great Lakes communities “become more resilient to extreme weather and other impacts of the climate crisis,” according to a White House fact sheet. Biden issued an executive order prioritizing environmental justice in April, establishing the new Office of Environmental Justice within the White House Council on Environmental Quality. In a speech at the time ahead of Earth Day, Biden said that “environmental justice will be the mission of the entire government woven directly into how we work with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments.” The funding to be announced Monday, which is part of the president’s signature climate and health care law enacted last year, will support building natural infrastructure, protecting public access to coastal natural resources and other measures aimed at protecting communities for storm surge, flooding and rising sea levels, according to the White House. Biden will also announce that he expects to host a White House Summit on Building Climate Resilient Communities later this year during which his administration will release a new National Climate Resilience Framework that will outline steps the federal government can take to promote climate resiliency, according to the fact sheet. CNN’s Ella Nilsen and Jack Forrest contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","The climate crisis is taking an enormous toll on Europe, which was ravaged by extreme heat, drought, wildfires and glacier melt last year, a new analysis has concluded. A joint report by the World Meteorological Organization and the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service found that last summer was the hottest on record for Europe and caused more than 16,000 excess deaths, according to the report. “Unfortunately, this cannot be considered a one-off occurrence or an oddity of the climate,” said Carlo Buontempo, the director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, in a statement. He added that current understanding of the climate system “informs us that these kinds of events are part of a pattern that will make heat stress extremes more frequent and more intense across the region.” Several countries, including the UK, Spain, Switzerland and Italy, saw their hottest years on record in 2022. Europe is the fastest-warming continent in the world, according to the report, and has been warming twice as fast as the global average for the last four decades. The continent was not only hot but also extremely dry, with big implications for agriculture and water supply. Many parts of the continent saw very low levels of precipitation last year, with France experiencing its driest January-to-September period on record. In Spain, water reserves plunged to just over 40% of capacity, the report found. Persistent drought and high temperatures fueled intense wildfires. Europe experienced the second-largest burned area on record in 2022, the report found, with Central Europe and the Mediterranean, in particular, seeing large areas scorched by fire. Glaciers in the European Alps had a bad year, experiencing a record loss of ice mass due to low snowfall, warm temperatures and Saharan dust, which makes glaciers darker, meaning they absorb more heat and melt faster. And oceans were unusually warm, with average sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic the hottest on record. Rates of warming in parts of the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic and Black Seas, and the southern Arctic were more than three times the global average, the report found. With the arrival of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon with a global warming effect, many scientists are concerned 2023 could see even starker climate extremes. But there are hopeful signs too. The report found that renewable energy generated more electricity than fossil gas for the first time ever last year, with wind and solar accounting for 22.3% of the EU’s electricity, while fossil gas accounted for 20% and coal power for 16%. “Increasing use of renewables and low-carbon energy sources is crucial to reduce dependence on fossil fuels,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Swiss voters have approved a new law to cut the use of fossil fuels and significantly reduce levels of planet-heating pollution, as the country faces alarming levels of glacier melt. The law, which was approved by just over 59% of voters during a referendum held on Sunday, requires that the country reach net zero – where it would remove from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as it emits – by 2050. Switzerland currently imports around three-quarters of its energy, with all of its oil and gas coming from abroad. “These fossil fuels will not be available indefinitely and they place a heavy burden on the climate,” a statement on the Swiss government website said Sunday. The government said it wants to reduce the use of oil and gas while increasing energy produced within Switzerland. The new bill includes measures to lower energy consumption and support companies to use more climate-friendly technology. Switzerland intends to invest 2 billion francs ($2.24 billion) into helping people to replace home heating systems run on fossil fuels with those run on renewables, and 1.2 billion francs ($1.34 billion) for businesses to green their technology, André Simonazzi, a Swiss government spokesperson, posted on Twitter. Switzerland, a country of 8.7 million people, has a system of direct democracy, which allows citizens to trigger a nationwide referendum on proposals that gain more than 100,000 signatures. A climate law was first introduced back in 2021, including measures to increase taxes on activities that produce high levels of planet-heating pollution, such as flying and driving gas-powered cars. But it was rejected by voters. This current climate bill was proposed as a response to the Glacier Initiative, set up by the Swiss Association for Climate Protection, which pushed for an end to fossil fuels in order to save the country’s glaciers. “This law now brings our country on the path to net-zero emissions by 2050 even though there’s still a long way to go until these changes are fully implemented,” said Matthias Huss, a glaciologist at ETH Zurich and who was a member of the Glacier Initiative’s scientific advisory board The record run of recent climate extremes in Switzerland, and worldwide, “seems to have convinced many citizens that climate change is no longer something looming on the horizon but it’s already here, and everybody is touched by it,” Huss told CNN. Switzerland has been increasingly feeling the impacts of the climate crisis. The country lost 6% of its glacier volume between 2021 and 2022, according to a recent World Meteorological Organization analysis."

","Donald Judd and Sam Fossum, CNN","President Joe Biden on Monday touted his administration’s record on climate change, which he called “the most aggressive climate action ever,” while hitting Republicans in Congress for trying to block it. “What we’re seeing here is an amazing success story of how you can work together to make our communities more climate resilient – that matters, it matters, resiliency matters,” he said from the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center and Preserve in Palo Alto, California, after a tour. “I’ve toured many sites across the country that clearly show climate change as a genuine existential – as the existential threat to humanity – the existential threat to humanity.” Biden’s defense of his climate record comes less than one week after four major environmental groups endorsed his 2024 reelection for president in the first-ever joint endorsement from the LCV Action Fund, NextGen PAC, the Sierra Club, and the NRDC Action Fund. Biden heavily courted climate and environmental justice groups during his last campaign and has made the climate crisis central to his governing agenda with new announcements over the last couple months on environmental justice initiatives and aggressive new rules to regulate planet-warming pollution from natural gas power plants. However, some groups have expressed frustration over his administration’s approval of a major Alaska oil project earlier this year. During his remarks Biden recounted previous trips to California during which he surveyed wildfire damage, noting that last year natural disasters caused $165 billion in damages across the country. “But the worsening impacts are not inevitable – building on our incredible efforts locally, my administration is doing all we can to help recover and build, so we can be prepared to adapt,” he said, outlining a series of new steps specifically focused on climate resilience. Among those steps are the $575 million “Climate Resilience Regional Challenge,” which will be launched by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The initiative will help coastal and Great Lakes communities “become more resilient to extreme weather and other impacts of the climate crisis,” according to a White House fact sheet. Other moves include $2 billion in Department of Energy funding – including $67 million for California alone – to modernize the electrical grid and make it more climate resilient, and the first-ever White House Climate resilience summit. The funding is provided through the Inflation Reduction Act, the president’s signature health care and climate legislation. However, that law has been under siege by congressional Republicans who are trying to repeal some of its provisions. “This is how we’re going to meet the moment – unfortunately, some of our MAGA Republican friends in Congress are continuing to try to undo all the progress we’ve already made in the first two and a half years,” Biden said. “They were holding the country hostage over the debt limit unless I would gut the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act – I had determined not to let that happen … and in the end, we didn’t just protect some of the climate money and clean energy provisions, we protected every single solitary one.”"

","Kathleen Magramo, CNN","The world’s highest peaks are at risk of losing up to 80% of their volume by the end of the century with profound consequences for millions of people under worst case climate scenarios, international scientists in Nepal warned in a new report. The report, published Tuesday by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), examined the impact of climate change on an area stretching 1.6 million square miles (4.1 million square kilometers) from Afghanistan in the west to Myanmar in the east. The report found that glaciers in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya mountain range region melted 65% faster in the 2010s compared with the previous decade, which suggests higher temperatures are already having an impact. Ice and snow in the region feeds 12 rivers that provide freshwater to two billion people in 16 countries, including China, India and Pakistan, and eventually too much water will eventually lead to too little, the report warns. The same group published a report in 2019, which found that even in the most optimistic case, where average global warming was limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, the region would lose at least one third of its glaciers. The group’s updated report shows those projections have since worsened. With between 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the world’s highest mountain region stands to lose 30% to 50% of its volume by 2100, the latest report said. If the world breaches 3 degrees Celsius of warming, glaciers in Nepal and Bhutan in the eastern Himalayas are at risk of losing 75% of their ice, and by just one degree more, that ticks up to 80%, according to the report. The annual mean global near-surface temperature for each year between 2023 and 2027 is predicted to be between 1.1 degrees Celsius and 1.8 degree Celsius higher than the 1850-1900 average, according to the World Meteorological Organization Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically. “In all three pillars of climate action – in mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage – we are at a standstill or going the wrong way; while the consequences of inaction are accelerating by the day,” Prof. Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh was quoted as saying in the report. About 240 million people live in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region, many of their cultures dating back thousands of years, and another the 1.65 billion live downstream. Many high mountain communities depend on glacial waters to irrigate crops and to maintain their livestock, but the accelerated melting would inundate farmlands downstream followed by periods of drought as water sources dry up, the report said. The erosion of glacial slopes also heightens the likelihood of floods, landslides and avalanches, increasing the risk to millions living in mountain communities. “For them, this is home, and their livelihoods are mostly dependent on agriculture, livestock, tourism, and medicinal and aromatic plants,” report co-author Amina Maharjan, a senior specialist in livelihoods and migration at ICIMOD. “What we realized in doing this assessment is that all of these are very, very sensitive to slight changes in climatic conditions and cryospheric conditions in the region,” she said. For example, snowfall patterns are increasingly out of sync with seasonality, blanketing pastures and shrinking the grazing land for livestock, Maharjan explained. Over the past half decade, yaks have died due to a lack of food in India, Nepal and Bhutan, leaving farmers with huge income loses, she added. The remoteness and rough terrain of the region also means that mountain communities often lack access to immediate disaster response. “The glaciers of the Hindu Kush Himalaya are a major component of the Earth system. With two billion people in Asia reliant on the water that glaciers and snow here hold, the consequences of losing this cryosphere are too vast to contemplate. We need leaders to act now to prevent catastrophe,” said Izabella Koziell, deputy director general of the ICIMOD. Unique species are also threatened by adverse changes to the climate of the diverse ecosystems that include tropical and subtropical rainforests, temperate coniferous forest and cold deserts, the report said. Fourteen species of butterflies have already become extinct from the Murree Hills of Pakistan, according to the report, while endemic frog species are among the most impacted by climate change as they experience breeding problems and developmental deformities."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Temperatures in parts of the North Atlantic Ocean are soaring off the charts, with an “exceptional” marine heat wave happening off the coasts of the United Kingdom and Ireland, sparking concerns about impacts on marine life. Parts of the North Sea are experiencing a category 4 marine heat wave – defined as “extreme” – according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In some areas, water temperatures are up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 Fahrenheit) hotter than usual. Global oceans have been exceptionally warm for months. April and May saw the highest ocean surface temperatures for those two months since records began in 1850. The regional picture is even more stark, according to the UK Met Office: Temperatures in the North Atlantic in May were around 1.25 degrees Celsius (2.25 Fahrenheit) above average. “The eastern Atlantic, from Iceland down to the tropics, is much warmer than average. But areas around parts of north-western Europe, including parts of the UK, have among some of the highest sea-surface temperatures relative to average,” Stephen Belcher, the Met Office’s chief scientist, said in a statement. Many scientists are sounding the alarm. The heatwave is “very exceptional,” said Mika Rantanen, a researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. It is “currently the strongest on Earth,” he told CNN. Richard Unsworth, an associate professor of biosciences at Swansea University in the UK and a founding director of Project-Seagrass, called the Atlantic heat wave “totally unprecedented.” It is “way beyond the worst-case predictions for the changing climate of the region. It’s truly frightening how fast this ocean basin is changing,” he told CNN. Risks are high for marine species, such as fish, coral and seagrass – many of which adapted to survive within certain temperature ranges. Hotter water can stress and even kill them. “There’s a very high potential that animals such as oysters, plants and algae will be killed by this European marine heatwave, particularly within shallow waters where temperatures may super heat beyond the background levels,” Unsworth said. Earlier this month, thousands of dead fish washed up along the Gulf Coast in Texas, a mass death which scientists believe is connected to rising ocean temperatures, as warmer water is able to hold less oxygen. And in 2021, an extreme heat wave cooked around a billion shellfish to death on Canada’s West Coast. Scientists say there are a number of factors behind the extreme heat. “It is the classic combination of the underpinning of human-caused climate change with a layer of natural variation within the climate system on top,” the UK Met Office said in a statement. Planet-heating pollution rises as the world continues to burn fossil fuels, which means higher temperatures for oceans and land. El Niño, which tends to have a warming effect globally, is expected to drive temperatures even higher this year. And other factors may also play a role, including a lack of dust from the Sahara, which usually helps cool the region by reflecting away sunlight. “Weaker than average winds have reduced the extent of dust in the region’s atmosphere potentially leading to higher temperatures,” said Albert Klein Tank, the head of the Met Office Hadley Centre, in a statement. Weaker winds may also have helped increase temperatures, as strong westerly winds typically cool the ocean surface, Rantanen said. Another potential driver of ocean heat could be anti-pollution regulations which require ships to cut sulfur in their fuel, reducing aerosols in the atmosphere. While these aerosols have a negative impact on human health, they also have a cooling impact by reflecting away sunlight. As climate change intensifies, marine heat waves are set to become more common. The frequency of marine heat waves has already increased more than 20-fold due to human-caused global warming, according to a 2020 study. “While we can’t in detail predict the intensity, duration and location of severe heating events such as the current marine heatwave, we know they’re increasingly likely to be more prevalent as our climate system collapses further,” Unsworth said."

","Joseph Ataman and Laura Paddison, CNN","The French government has decided to dissolve a climate activist group, following a series of fiery clashes between demonstrators and police. The decision to shut down Soulèvements de la Terre (the Earth Uprisings), an umbrella organization of climate activist groups, was taken by the French cabinet following a request by President Emmanuel Macron, government spokesperson Olivier Véran  told journalists on Wednesday. The process to shut down the group started in March, after a protest in western France over proposed so-called “mega water basins” for farm irrigation led to violent clashes with police, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. Police fired teargas and vehicles were set alight, with serious injuries among both police officers and protesters, according to Reuters. “It’s not the freedoms of protest nor expression that are in question. It’s not ideas that are being sanctioned, it’s the repeated turn to violence against property, against people, that has occurred again in these last weeks,” Véran said. “The use of violence is not legitimate in the rule of law,” he added. This Tuesday, 14 people linked to the group were placed in custody as part of an investigation into a protest action in December 2022 against a major cement manufacturer, BFMTV reported. Soulèvements de la Terre plans to appeal its dissolution, according to BFMTV. The group also said that the French government’s decision could help it garner support. “We see it as a call to set up a network of resistance, as a lever to help even more people join the next actions of Soulèvements de la Terre,” said the group in a press release shared with CNN. “The government claimed to make us disappear, but in reality we are becoming more and more visible,” the statement added. In recent weeks, the movement has organized protests across France, including against the concrete industry, construction of a new rail line with Italy and a new road project in the southwest. This last protest was banned by the government, according to BFMTV. Soulèvements de la Terre, which said it has 110,000 registered members, confirmed that it has plans for further protests over the summer. The French organization La Ligue des Droits de l’Homme (the Human Rights League) said the decision to close the group is a worrying sign of a crackdown on environmental protest. “This decision comes in a climate particularly hostile to this environmental movement, attempting to bluntly silence it and its supporters,” the organization said in a statement. Paris’ mayor Anne Hidalgo tweeted her support for the movement Tuesday. “Regularly condemned for its climate inaction, the government would do well to not criminalize the commitment of ecologist activists mobilized for the planet,” she wrote. Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who heads the largest left-wing group in the French parliament, also condemned the government’s move Tuesday, blaming the interior minister for the violence at environmental protests."

","Reuters and Laura Paddison, CNN","Climate change may have stimulated a plankton bloom that caused thousands of dead fish to wash up along a roughly 4 kilometer (2.5 mile) stretch of beach in Thailand’s southern Chumphon province on Thursday, an expert said. Thon Thamrongnawasawat, deputy dean of the Faculty of Fisheries at Kasetsart University, attributed the fish deaths to the bloom – a natural occurrence that lowers oxygen levels in the water and causes fish to suffocate. “Various natural phenomena, such as coral bleaching or plankton bloom, have naturally occurred for thousands to tens of thousands of years. However, when global warming occurs, it intensifies and increases the frequency of existing phenomena,” he said. According to local authorities, plankton blooms happen once or twice a year and typically last two to three days. Officials have collected seawater for further assessment and analysis. Worldwide, marine heatwaves have become a growing concern this year. Global sea surface temperatures for April and May were the highest on record for those months, according to the British Met Office, which said the cause is both the arrival of the natural climate phenomenon El Niño, which has a warming impact globally, as well as human-caused climate change, which means higher temperatures for oceans and land. This month, thousands of dead fish washed up on beaches in Texas, and experts are warning of algal blooms along the British coast as a result of rising sea temperatures. In Southern California, hundreds of dolphins and sea lions have been washing up on beaches dead or sick, amid a toxic algal bloom. While California’s algal blooms were caused more by strong coastal upwelling than high temperatures, scientists say climate change likely to increase toxic algal blooms, as some thrive in warm water. “Whether it’s Australia and places like the Great Barrier Reef or even places around England which are experiencing quite bad marine heatwaves at the moment, it’s really going to be detrimental to those local ecosystems,” said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist with the University of New South Wales in Australia."

This week, he is making the news. After spending the last two years as chief meteorologist at Des Moines news station KCCI, a CNN affiliate, Gloninger announced Wednesday he is resigning as one of the many faces of local TV weather. His departure comes months after receiving a series of harassing emails from a viewer who disagreed with one thing he did on-air: he explained how weather was linked to the climate crisis. He also received other negative feedback via private messages and social media, which has become a common experience for weather and climate communicators. The decision was not easy, Gloninger told the Washington Post, but in a tweet announcing his exit, he cited a “death threat stemming from my climate coverage” which he said resulted in post-traumatic stress. He also mentioned the need to address family health issues. The emails from the viewer, according to screenshots Gloninger’s tweeted, called the meteorologist a “liberal conspiracy” theorist and told him to “go east and drown from the ice cap melting.” It escalated last summer when he received a more menacing threat from the viewer. “It is mentally exhausting and at times I have not been ok,” Gloninger tweeted at the time. “The threat of course was concerning, but the stream of harassing emails is even more distressing.” Gloninger said he plans to “embark on a new journey dedicated to helping solve the climate crisis,” in addition to spending more time with family. His last day is on July 7. A statement from KCCI about his departure said Gloninger plans to go into climate consulting: “Gloninger is leaving television to focus on caring for his family and his own mental health. He plans to pursue work in climate consulting.” Gloninger’s experience is not an isolated one. Climate change has become a highly politicized topic, despite hundreds of global scientists concluding it is “unequivocal” that humans have caused the crisis and that “widespread and rapid changes” have already occurred around the world. Climate communicators, journalists, meteorologists and national weather services, including those in the US, Spain and Australia, have reported an increase in harassment, threats and abuse for connecting extreme weather events to climate change. In France, for instance, meteorologists have been accused of overstating the country’s drought and heat. Météo France, the French national meteorological service, said the agency’s communications are “the object of more and more repeated attacks,” a Météo France spokesperson previously told CNN. In a series of tweets posted Friday, Jeff Berardelli, the chief meteorologist at WFLA in Tampa Bay, said while the group of people who strongly deny climate change make up only a small fraction of the US population, “they are very loud, giving the impression they are a much larger slice of the public.” Berardelli acknowledged it is hard to change the minds of those who deny climate science. Instead, he said he tries to educate those who are open to learning. “Climate was made political in recent decades, but inherently it is not, so simply don’t accept that frame,” he said in a tweet. “Science is science. Period. Push back [with] science fact, but only with those who are open. Ignore those who would politicize.” Gloninger has worked for seven news stations across five states. He shared news of his departure from TV news on air this Wednesday, the same date as Climate Stripes Day, where climate-minded people, including scientists and meteorologists, join a campaign to turn the world’s attention toward the climate crisis. The #ShowYourStripes campaign is a visual one, designed to illustrate how much the Earth has warmed. And during his farewell segment, Gloninger wore a necktie with the iconic pattern on air. CNN’s Laura Paddison contributed to this report."

Just as demand surges, supply can simultaneously be constrained by problems at power facilities caused by those same sizzling temperatures. Power grid officials have warned that large swaths of the United States could face blackouts if it’s a hot summer. “Two-thirds of North America is at risk of energy shortfalls this summer during periods of extreme demand,” the North American Energy Reliability Corporation (NERC) concluded in its summer outlook published last month. According to NERC, virtually the entire United States west of the Mississippi River could suffer energy shortages during “extreme conditions.” That includes the Western half of the United States, the Central region and the power system that serves most of Texas. New England and Ontario are also at “elevated” risk of blackouts, NERC said. “The elevated risk outlook is driven by a combination of conventional generation retirements, a substantial increase in forecast peak demand and an increasing threat to reliability from a widespread heat event,” NERC said. The good news is that officials believe the entire power grid should have enough power to meet normal peak summer demand this year. The risk of blackouts comes into play only if there is extreme heat. But many Americans in the South and Central regions of the United States are dealing with extreme heat right now. Almost 40 million people from Arizona to Alabama are under excessive heat warnings and heat advisories on Monday. In the deserts and West Texas, forecasters are warning of temperatures above 110˚F.  Some locations could reach or feel like 120˚F. Meteorologists say the heat wave could continue through the beginning of next week. And more could be on the way: Large parts of the United States are at risk of hotter-than-average temperatures over the next three months. According to the most recent forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, much of the Pacific Northwest, Southwest, Texas, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast have the highest probability of above average temperatures in the next 90 days. There are several X-factors that could determine whether the power grid holds up or not. One issue is that as coal power plants retire, parts of the power grid are increasingly reliant on cleaner sources – namely wind and solar – to meet high demand. But conditions don’t always allow these renewable sources of power to generate as much electricity as needed. “The intermittent nature of wind power (wind turbines only generate electricity if the wind is blowing, and how much electricity they generate depends on how windy it is) present operational challenges for grid operators,” analysts from the US Energy Information Administration wrote in a report on Monday. “Low wind and high demand periods could result in energy emergencies.” Wind plays a central role in meeting demand in Texas as well as the two power grid regions that cover most of the central part of the United States. Drought conditions and low levels of major reservoirs could also hurt hydro power generation. NERC also flagged concerns about new environmental rules that restrict power plant emissions, warning these regulations will limit the operation of coal-fired generators in 23 states, including Nevada, Utah and states along the Gulf Coast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest. This is the first summer since the implementation of the EPA’s Good Neighbor Plan, which aims to reduce cross-state smog from power plants and other industrial sites. The power grid is also grappling with supply chain and worker shortage problems that have cause some power facilities to delay or cancel maintenance aimed at getting the system primed for summer. Specifically, NERC warned that low inventories of replacement transformers could derail efforts to restart power facilities following hurricanes and severe storms."

But with mercury levels expected to remain high in other areas, the soaring heat has highlighted how millions in the world’s most populous nation are among the most vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis. The weekend downpour in Uttar Pradesh was a welcome change for the northern state of 220 million after temperatures in some areas soared to 47 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit) last week, sickening hundreds with heat-related illnesses. On Sunday, temperatures dropped acutely in Lucknow to around 32 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit), as the capital, along with other cities, experienced the first rain during this year’s monsoon season. Video broadcast on local television showed people getting soaked in the rain and commuters navigating waterlogged roads. The rain in Uttar Pradesh is likely to continue this week, bringing cooler temperatures to the region. But in the neighboring state of Bihar, unrelenting heat has extended into its second week, forcing schools to shutter until Wednesday. At least 44 people have died from heat-related illness across the state in recent weeks, a senior health official told CNN, but the number could be much higher as authorities struggle to accurately assess how many people have died from heatstroke. Temperatures are expected to slightly cool over the coming days, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), however experts say the climate crisis is only going to cause more frequent and longer heatwaves in the future, testing India’s ability to adapt. “India has a history of dealing with heat… There are going to be millions affected,” said Dr. Chandni Singh, Senior Researcher at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements, adding the number of deaths that will be result from staggering heat depends on how prepared health systems are to deal with it. “If health systems aren’t functioning, when you don’t have adequate emergency services, it will lead to (more deaths),” she said. “But what we know for certain is we are going to be approaching limits to survivability by mid-century.” India is not the only country in the region to experience such sweltering heat in recent weeks. Temperatures in northeast China are expected to remain high in the coming days, with mercury levels rising above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in certain cities, according to its meteorological observatory. In Pakistan’s capital Islamabad, temperatures soared to 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) last week before weekend rain brought some relief to the region. And studies warn the impact of extreme heat could be devastating. India often experiences heatwaves during the summer months of May and June, but in recent years, they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged. Last April, India experienced a heatwave which saw temperatures in capital New Delhi go beyond 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) for seven consecutive days. In some states, the heat closed schools, damaged crops and put pressure on energy supplies, as officials warned residents to remain indoors and keep hydrated. India is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), potentially affecting 1.4 billion people nationwide. And experts say the the cascading effects of this will be devastating. A study published in April by the University of Cambridge said heatwaves in India are putting “unprecedented burdens” on India’s agriculture, economy and public health systems, stalling efforts to reach its development goals. “Long-term projections indicate that Indian heatwaves could cross the survivability limit for a healthy human resting in the shade by 2050,” the study said. “They will impact the labor productivity, economic growth, and quality of life of around 310 - 480 million people. Estimates show a 15% decrease in outdoor working capacity during daylight hours due to extreme heat by 2050.” Singh said India has already taken steps to mitigate the impacts of high temperatures, including altering working hours for some outdoor workers and increasing heat education. But the effects of extreme heat will impact our environment, energy consumption and eco-systems, she warned. “Typically in a heatwave, you also see related water scarcity and droughts. You see the failure of the electricity grid. These risks start stressing the entire system,” she said. “Crop productivity will get affected. There will be huge impacts on other animals. When we come up with heat reduction plans, these are all things that are important to remember.” India’s heatwave in the north came as heavy rain battered the country’s northeast, with pre-monsoon rain in Assam state triggering landslides and heavy flooding. Nearly half a million people have been affected after heavy showers battered the region, turning roads into rivers and submerging entire villages. The rain in Assam came one week after after tropical cyclone Biparjoy hit India’s west coast, ripping trees and toppling electricity poles. Elsewhere in the region, Pakistan also saw heavy rain in capital Islamabad over the weekend, bringing some relief from the high temperatures the week prior. The rain may cause urban flooding in key cities, the country’s weather forecasting center said, advising farmers to manage their crops and encouraging travelers to remain cautious. China is expected to see soaring temperatures across several cities, including capital Beijing. Last week, Beijing’s temperature soared above 41 degrees Celsius (105.8 degrees Fahrenheit), setting a new record for the capital’s hottest day in June. According to the country’s meteorological observatory, Beijing, Tianjin, Heibei, Shandong will “continue to be baked by high temperatures.” CNN’s Tara Subramaniam contributed reporting"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Last year may have seen a record growth of wind and solar power but planet-heating fossil fuels continued to provide most of the world’s energy, according to a new analysis. Oil, coal and gas made up 82% of global energy consumption last year, according to the Statistical Review of World Energy report by the Energy Institute and consultancies KPMG and Kearney. The report, which analyzes data on world energy markets, found that energy consumption rose by 1% in 2022, with fossil fuels helping to meet the demand, Oil consumption and production both increased last year, the report found. Gas made up 24% of global energy consumption, down slightly from 25% in 2021. Coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, saw consumption grow by 0.6% in 2022 compared with 2021, largely driven by demand from China and India, according to the report. And global coal production rose by 7%. As fossil fuels continued to dominate, the amount of planet-heating pollution produced by the energy sector rose to a new high last year, growing by 0.8%. “The share of world energy still coming from fossil fuels remains stubbornly stuck at 82%, which should act as a clarion call for governments to inject more urgency into the energy transition,” Simon Virley, vice chair and head of energy and natural resources at consultancy KPMG, said in a statement. Last year saw solar generation grow by 25% and wind by 13.5% compared with the previous year. Yet renewable energy, excluding hydropower, still only made up 7.5% of the world’s energy consumption in 2022. “2022 saw some of the worst ever impacts of climate change – the devastating floods affecting millions in Pakistan, the record heat events across Europe and North America – yet we have to look hard for positive news on the energy transition in this new data,” Juliet Davenport, president of the Energy Institute, said in a statement. “We are still heading in the opposite direction to that required by the Paris Agreement,” she added. Countries have agreed to cut levels of planet-heating pollution by 43% by 2030, to meet an ambition to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Breaching the 1.5-degree threshold significantly increases the chance of catastrophic and potentially irreversible changes and risks triggering major tipping points, including the death of coral reefs and the melting of polar ice sheets."

But what happens when those weather events are no longer just analogies?

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. We’ve all heard Wall Street bigwigs compare the looming recession to gathering storm clouds, hurricanes, and heavy fog. But what happens when those weather events are no longer just analogies? This month, extreme heatwaves in Texas and other southern states, toxic air caused by wildfires in the north and extreme storms along the eastern seaboard have caused more strife in an economy already on the brink of dropping into reverse gear. “It hurts the economy, and it certainly doesn’t provide that stability that would allow us to avoid something like slipping into a recession,” said Justin Mankin, a professor of geography at Dartmouth College who focuses on the risks global warming poses to ecosystems and people. What’s happening: Over 90 million people, mostly along the east coast, were under threat on Monday as the system that produced nearly 400 storm reports on Sunday moved eastward. Another 40 million people in seven southern states fell under heat wave warnings on Monday, as the brutal ongoing heatwave in Texas fans out. All told, at least a third of the US population is currently grappling with costly extreme weather events. That’s on top of the nine confirmed US weather and climate disaster events so far this year each with losses exceeding $1 billion (many more will likely be confirmed in the coming weeks), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Those nine events alone have totaled about $23.7 billion in damages to the US economy, researchers found, and some analysts say that vastly underestimates the long-term impact. In 2022, extreme weather events cost the United States about $165 billion, according to the NOAA. Just how costly these events will end up being is still largely unknown. “The nature of these extremes is that they propagate through our economies in ways that we don’t totally understand,” explained Mankin. “We know enough to say that they’re very harmful but in terms of their actual costs, and for how long those costs accumulate, that’s something that we in the research community are just getting a handle on.” Heat waves in particular, he said, typically deliver a shock to the economy. Texas already loses about $30 billion a year in productivity due to its hot climate, according to an NOAA report. They project that number will jump to about $110 billion a year by 2050 — 2.5% of Texas’ economy. Sector by sector: Extreme weather impacts the economy writ large, but certain sectors tend to suffer more than others. Take airlines, for instance. More than 5,000 flights across the United States were delayed or canceled Monday as powerful storms ripped through parts of the country. Flight delays often result in huge economic losses; the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimated the cost of airline backups to be about $33 billion in 2019. This spring, Southwest Airlines cited extreme weather as a growing concern for airlines after December storm disruptions cost the company nearly $1.2 billion. “Whether it’s for hurricanes or winter weather or rain, thunderstorms, we now need to have a planning process that includes outcomes that are beyond what we’ve seen before. That’s a big takeaway for us,” said Southwest COO Andrew Watterson. Agriculture, construction, tourism and renewable energy sectors also tend to feel the brunt of extreme weather events. The consumer cost: In Texas, power costs have increased by 100% in some instances as the record heat wave drives demand higher, adding considerably to household costs. Flood insurance and home insurance have also become necessary but often unattainable. Experts fear the cost of insurance will only get worse as climate change intensifies both hurricanes and extreme rain events. Major insurance companies have already virtually pulled out of the Florida market, leaving homeowners paying premiums nearly four times higher than those paid elsewhere in the country. Hurricane risk is part of Florida’s problem — Hurricane Ian last year was the most expensive storm ever to hit the state. “We’re really poorly adapted to the extreme weather and climate that we have right now,” said Mankin. “And that also goes for our economy.” Russia’s economy is much smaller than America’s and China’s, but it plays an outsized role in shaping the world economy, according to my colleague Mark Thompson. That’s because it’s still one of the biggest suppliers of energy to global markets — including China and India. Analysts at Rystad Energy said bouts of geopolitical uncertainty in major oil-producing nations over the past 35 years — ranging from civil unrest to coup attempts, armed conflicts and changes of governments — had on average added 8% to the price of oil in the five days after the triggering event. That uncertainty was there as disaffected Russian mercenaries marched toward Moscow this weekend, drawing a stark warning from President Vladimir Putin that the country was on the brink of a 1917-style “civil war.” The armed insurrection has been defused — for now — but the most serious challenge to Putin’s authority in 23 years could still usher in a period of turmoil and change. Any meaningful loss of Russian energy would force China and India to compete with Western nations for supplies from other producers. If political chaos restricts exports of other commodities, such as grains or fertilizer, that could also send supply and demand out of whack. And that could push up prices for everyone. Oil and natural gas prices climbed Monday, while wheat prices briefly spiked higher, as investors reacted to the chaotic insurrection. US crude oil futures briefly climbed 1.3%, before trading up 0.6% on Monday evening. Brent crude, the international benchmark, gained 0.6%. Both contracts lost nearly 4% last week. Stories of mass layoffs around the US may be dominating news cycles, but US workers feel good about the job market. Consumers are not worried about becoming unemployed anytime soon, according to a new Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey. The Fed’s May survey of households, called the Survey of Consumer Expectations, found that workers in the US thought there was less than an 11% chance they’d lose their jobs in the next year. That’s down from 12.2% the month prior and the lowest rate since April of 2022. The number of US consumers who believe unemployment will be higher a year from now also dropped this month."

Around 90 afternoon high-temperature records could be broken across the South, from Texas to the Mississippi Valley and parts of Florida, according to data from the National Weather Service. But overnight temperatures will also stay abnormally high, with potentially 180 nighttime records broken over the next seven days. Hotter nights are a consequence of the climate crisis, scientists have warned. On average, nights are warming faster than days in most of the US, according to the 2018 National Climate Assessment. “We think it’s because as the days grow warmer, there is more moisture in the air that traps the heat,” Lisa Patel, the executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, told CNN. “During the day, that moisture reflects the heat, but at night, it traps the heat in.” Increasing nighttime heat is even more common in cities because of the urban heat island effect, in which metro areas are significantly hotter than their surroundings. Dallas, for example, is set to go six consecutive days without seeing temperatures drop below 80 degrees Fahrenheit overnight — a June record for the city. Areas with a lot of asphalt, concrete, buildings and freeways absorb more of the sun’s heat than areas with parks, rivers and tree-lined streets. At night, when temperatures are supposed to cool down, the retained heat is released back into the air, said Kristie Ebi, a climate and health expert at the University of Washington. Areas with a lot of green space – with grass and trees that reflect sunlight and create shade – are cooler on summer’s hottest days. “Many cities put together cooling shelters, but people have to know where they are, how to get to them and what hours they operate,” Ebi told CNN, noting that city officials need to rethink urban planning to consider climate change. “It’s going to take a while for trees to grow, but we need tree planting programs focusing on places that are particularly vulnerable — making sure that city planning takes into account that we’re heading into a much warmer future.” Houston has had nine days far this month that haven’t dropped below 80 degrees — nearly double what’s typical for June. This has only happened two other times in the city’s records. Nighttime should be when our bodies are given a break from the heat, Patel said. But with climate change, that’s becoming less likely to happen. A recent study found that heat-related deaths could increase six-fold by the end of the century due to warmer nighttime temperatures, unless planet-warming pollution is significantly curbed. Researchers have also warned the climate crisis is already affecting people’s ability to sleep. A study published last month found that people living in warmer climates lose more sleep for each degree of temperature increase. “We all know what it’s like to try to fall asleep on a hot night — it’s uncomfortable,” Patel said. “We often lose sleep. It is estimated that by the end of the century, we could lose about two days of sleep per year, and it will be worse for people without access to air conditioning.” Patel explains that at its most extreme, when a human body does not get the chance to recover — typically at night — heat stress can progress to heat stroke, which is associated with confusion, dizziness and passing out. And while this can happen to anyone, she said the impacts are more amplified on the elderly, people with chronic underlying health conditions, and young children, particularly infants. Heat waves that go on for several days tend to be associated with more deaths as the body can no longer keep itself cool. “Living through a heat wave during the day can be like running a race,” Patel said. “We need a cool break to recover and recuperate, and when nighttime temperatures don’t drop, we don’t get that critical time we need to relieve the stress on our bodies from being overheated during the day.” CNN’s Brandon Miller, Monica Garrett and Taylor Ward contributed to this report."

","Caolán Magee, CNN","The destruction of the world’s rainforests ramped up last year, despite global pledges to end deforestation by 2030, according to a new report. An area of tropical forest the size of Switzerland was lost in 2022, as forest destruction rose by 10% compared to the previous year, according to the report by the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Global Forest Watch, which draws on data collected by the University of Maryland. The rate of loss was equivalent to losing 11 soccer fields of forest a minute, the report found, as swaths of tropical forest were cleared for farming, mining and other commercial activities. As well as having a devastating impact on wildlife, this destruction has significant consequences for climate change, as tropical forests are important stores of carbon dioxide. The amount of carbon pollution produced in 2022 from deforestation was equivalent to India’s annual fossil fuel emissions, according to the report. Brazil cut down the most tropical primary forest, amounting to 43% of the global total, the report found. The country’s rate of forest loss rose 15% from 2021 to 2022. This comes as some scientists warn the Amazon is approaching a critical tipping point that could see the rainforest transform into a grassy savannah, with huge implications for the world’s ability to tackle the climate crisis. The 2022 figures are from the final year of Jair Bolsonaro’s presidency in Brazil, which saw high rates of deforestation. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took office in January, has pledged to tackle Amazon deforestation and repair the damage caused by his predecessor. Elsewhere, the Democratic Republic of Congo lost more than half a million hectares in 2022, primarily because of land clearing for farming, while Ghana had the biggest relative increase in rainforest destruction when compared to 2021, the report found. Bolivia saw a record-high level of primary forest loss last year, with a 32% increase compared to 2021. It came in third behind only Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo for area of primary forest loss, the report found. This destruction has happened despite an agreement by more than 100 world leaders to end and reverse deforestation by the end of the decade, made at the COP26 UN climate conference in Glasgow in 2021. At the time, Boris Johnson, then the UK prime minister, hailed it as a “landmark agreement to protect and restore the Earth’s forests.” But as deforestation intensifies, experts have called into question the validity of the commitments. Rod Taylor, global director of WRI’s Forest Program, said in a statement: “We have seen governments and companies make time-bound commitments to end deforestation, restore degraded forest landscapes, and achieve sustainable forest management.” “But rapid deforestation and forest degradation have continued, driven primarily by growing global demand for food, fuel, and fiber. Climate change impacts, including severe fires and new vectors and outbreaks of forest pests and diseases, exacerbate the decline,” he continued. There was some better news in the report, however. Despite the global increase in deforestation, there has been a sharp reduction in forest loss in Indonesia and loss levels in Malaysia have remained low, according to the report. Tacking the palm industry has been a big factor, the report found. In Indonesia there has been a clamp down on new oil palm plantations, which have been a major driver of deforestation in the country, while Malaysia has also strengthened palm oil regulations."

Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. People in vast swathes of America are breathing in the smoky air from Canada’s record-breaking wildfires. Residents of Chicago, Detroit and other areas in the Great Lakes region woke up to poor air quality this week. They are experiencing the unsettling fog that New Yorkers lived through a few weeks ago, which was eerily reminiscent of the pandemic: Broadway shows were closed, masks were on faces and many city streets were emptied. And smoke is expected to make a return visit to the mid-Atlantic on Thursday. Scientists have pointed out that this summer’s air quality problems are connected to the climate change crisis we have been facing for decades. Wildfires will become increasingly common as temperatures rise, producing greater bouts of drought and drier air. Moments such as these require the government to take action to help protect Americans from the dangers of smog and other climate issues. The government has a wide array of tools at its disposal, from air quality tracking technology to large caches of medical supplies, which can limit the damage. But this moment also presents an important governing opportunity for elected officials who have struggled to build political support for bold climate change measures that would get to the root of some of these issues. President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act contained some of the most sweeping climate change measures that the nation has seen. As a result of this act, and key programs in other legislation passed during his tenure, the federal government is investing billions in transportation infrastructure connected to flooding and providing over a billion dollars to diminish the risks of wildfires and bolster forest health, which includes better pay for firefighters as well as drought mitigation. The president was recently in California boasting about what he had done. Yet Biden would undoubtedly be the first to admit that Washington has a long way to go. The legislation was a first step towards reducing emissions, but it was only a single step towards addressing the immense policy needs that will be required to save the planet and ourselves. One of the most difficult elements of climate change is that the threat feels remote and abstract for many Americans. Traditionally, our slow-moving political process responds best when there is an immediate crisis at hand. The impetus for legislation, as Princeton University doctoral student Robert Oldham is discovering in his research, often comes from constituents who demand immediate action on an issue they deem important — often with the help of ongoing media coverage. For their elected officials, doing nothing could mean political fallout. In recent years, however, as with the air quality, there have been more concrete examples —wildfires, flooding, beach erosion, intense heat and more — of what climate change is doing to our world. There are many cases of legislation requiring a tangible crisis in the lives of Americans to stir Congress to action. During the 1930s, the federal government finally tackled problems such as unemployment insurance and rural electrification – only after the bottom fell out for most families as a result of the Great Depression. President John F. Kennedy, who resisted moving on civil rights legislation in the first two years of his presidency, finally sent a bill to Congress after activists such as Martin Luther King Jr. had exposed to the nation, through protests in cities such as Birmingham, what racism really looked like in the Deep South. During the late 1940s, the federal government only moved to reorganize and vastly expand its national security apparatus and defense spending after the very real threats of the Cold War were felt on the home-front: the peril of a communist superpower armed with atomic and nuclear weapons. It was only after the deadly attack by al-Qaeda on our nation in 2001 that the government finally bolstered airport security, even though policymakers had spent endless hours criticizing the lax oversight we had depended on. Most recently, it took a devastating global pandemic to shake elected officials into taking a serious look at our public health system. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the American Rescue Plan, both of which included much-needed investments for dealing with pandemics, didn’t pass Congress until 2020 and 2021, respectively. It took a major pandemic to pressure Congress into passing legislation that could help prevent another. Governing through crisis is not the best way to handle long-term problems, but it is the way we will likely be spurred into legislative action, at least for the foreseeable future. Importantly, crises don’t automatically translate into government action. This is where presidential leadership can matter. The smoke from wildfires enables leaders to connect the dots for voters. Doing so is not politicizing these situations but rather exercising leadership to address the root causes of an issue. Millions of Americans are feeling the painful and immediate effects of environmental degradation. For too long we have been sitting still. We can’t afford to do so any longer."

","Caolán Magee, CNN","China is on track to double its wind and solar energy capacity and hit its 2030 clean energy targets five years early, a new report has found. The country is expected to produce 1,200 gigwatts of solar and wind power by 2025 if all prospective plants are built and commissioned, according to the study from the non profit Global Energy Monitor. Solar capacity in China is now greater than the rest of the world combined. Its onshore and offshore wind capacity has doubled since 2017, and is roughly equal to the combined total of the other top seven countries, according to the report. Dorothy Mei, project manager at Global Energy Monitor, said China’s surge in solar and wind capacity was “jaw-dropping.” The country’s renewable energy boom is the result of a combination of incentives and regulations, according to the report. China pledged in 2020 to become carbon neutral by 2060. But, while China may have become the global leader in renewable energy, the world’s biggest producer of planet-heating pollution is also ramping up coal production. “China is making strides, but with coal still holding sway as the dominant power source, the country needs bolder advancements in energy storage and green technologies for a secure energy future,” Martin Weil, a researcher at Global Energy Monitor, said in a statement. Coal power permitting in China accelerated rapidly last year when new permits reached their highest level since 2015, according to a report by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air and the Global Energy Monitor. The amount of new coal projects permitted was equivalent to two large coal plants a week, the report found. The country turned to coal last year in large part because of devastating heat waves and drought, the worst in six decades, which saw a surging demand for power at the same time as hydropower capacity plunged as rivers ran dry. China’s reliance on coal poses a significant challenge to global green energy targets, but the pace of wind and solar development is a positive sign, Byford Tsang, senior policy adviser at climate think tank E3G told CNN. “China is rapidly and successfully scaling up its deployment of renewable power and has become the largest investor into renewables globally. This is both a cause and consequence of rapidly falling costs of renewable energy as compared to coal power,” he said. Tsang hopes that relative cheapness of renewable energy will persuade China to kick its coal habit. “China’s ability to build and deploy homegrown, cost-competitive renewable energy at speed and scale further calls into question the economic viability of new coal projects into the future,” he added. In 2021, the IEA said that no new coal-fired power plants can be built, and no new oil and gas be developed, if the world is to limit warming to 1.5  degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to a report from ERG."

But that’s not the only effects expected: Combined with climate change, El Niño this year could dent US economic growth, potentially impacting everything from food prices to the winter clothing sales. “There are these major negative economic growth consequences where there’s extreme weather,” said Christopher Callahan, a Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth and lead author on a study in the journal Science attributing $5.7 trillion in global income losses to the 1997-98 El Niño and $4.1 trillion in losses to the 1982-1983 El Niño. Countries can feel the negative affects of these climate patterns years after they end, the study found. “The effects of these events last a long time, and they are far more costly than we used to think,” Christopher Callahan, a Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth and lead author of the study, said. El Niño, part of a larger pattern called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is a naturally occurring climate system marked by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, and it appears every 2-7 years, according to NOAA. That can result in more typhoons and cyclones in the Pacific, said Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux, a professor at the University of Vermont who studies climate variability and change. And, because weather systems are complex, that can also suppress hurricane activity in the Atlantic, she noted. But El Niño’s potentially dramatic impact stretches far beyond the Pacific Ocean. Jin-Yi Yu, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of California Irvine, said the climate pattern usually results in “abnormal” weather patterns, including droughts in typically rainy southeast Asia and Australia, and rainfall in the normally arid deserts of the Southwestern United States. The climate event’s impact will become more apparent in the US by late fall: Winters are generally warmer in the north of the United States and colder and rainier in the south during El Niño, Yu said. Callahan said extreme weather associated with El Niño causes flooding, wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters. That could affect prices for foods Americans eat every day: Futures in sugar and cocoa are trading at multi-year highs on predictions of shortages, while robusta coffee futures are trading at all-time highs. That can translate into higher prices for chocolate, for coffee and more. Higher food prices are a common theme across El Niño events, according to a recent Deutsche Bank report. The effects go beyond farms. Simeon Siegel, an analyst analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said unexpected swings in weather can negatively impact the retail sector. “Although no retailer ever wants to blame the weather because it comes off as an excuse, weather is absolutely critical for most retail, particularly apparel and seasonal goods,” he said. “Not only must the retailers or brands forecast what consumers will want, they also need to predict what nature is going to throw at them. Obviously, for companies that sell coats, grills, outdoor furniture, sweaters, or shorts, the weather can be the difference between needing to buy that coat or not,” he added. The travel and tourism sector may also feel the sting of El Niño. For a 2021 study in the scientific journal Atmosphere, researchers analyzed the number of visits to 48 natural attractions in the United States to test willingness to travel during El Niño events. The research concluded that these weather events led to a “significant decrease” in tourist visits. El Niño conditions also tend to amplify hurricane-like storms in the Pacific Ocean, according to Dupigny-Giroux. In fact, according to the Deutsche Bank report, “The Pacific hurricane season saw 16 hurricanes in each of 2014 and 2015, the joint highest number on record.” A repeat could prove to be a headache for airline companies, which are already struggling with weather-related cancellations and disruptions this summer. Inclement weather is “by far, the largest cause of flight delays,” according to the US Federal Aviation Administration. However, El Niño could bring benefits to some areas. Chris Scheuring, a water attorney for the California Farm Bureau, said his state would welcome a rainy season after battling years-long droughts in the past. “A wet year in general on this landscape is very good. The reservoirs refill themselves, the aquifers bounce back a little bit, and the snowpack is great. That’s a very good thing,” he said. “It’s almost always a good thing for farming, except for those folks that suffer flood-related impacts,” he added. To be sure, not every El Niño is guaranteed to significantly impact the weather, according to Dupigny-Giroux. “Everything is looking like we will go into at least a weak or moderately strong one, but no one is hanging their hat to say it’s a guarantee right now,” she said. The last time there was an El Niño in 2018 through 2019, NOAA dubbed it “The Great Puny El Niño” due to its relatively weak impact on weather conditions. However, NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center recently said there were “pretty good” odds that this El Niño event will strengthen at its peak, and Dupigny-Giroux said climate change may intensify some of the resulting weather events. “A lot of times when you hear the term climate change, you think about air temperatures, but for these types of systems, ocean temperatures are critically important, and additional warming in the air is actually being stored in the oceans,” she said. “That means the oceans are going to be warmer, which then allow for more potential storm systems to occur.” Callahan’s research for Dartmouth estimates that amplified El Niño patterns could produce “potentially devastating socioeconomic impacts” in the coming decades. He projects that El Niño weather events could cause $84 trillion in economic losses in the 21st century."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","There are very few winners in the climate crisis, but scientists are pretty sure there’s going to be at least one: Mosquitoes. These insects – annoying at best, deadly at worst – thrive in warmth and humidity. As climate change ushers in more frequent and more severe heat waves, as well as storms and floods that leave behind pools of stagnant water in which most breed, it’s boom time for mosquitoes. For the first time in decades, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning of several locally acquired cases of malaria in the United States – news that has thrust mosquitoes into the spotlight. While it’s too soon to know whether these specific cases are connected to climate change, scientists have been warning that malaria could become more common in the US as temperatures rise there. It has raised fresh concerns about mosquitoes pushing into regions they have not been in for generations – or ever – and what that might mean for the spread of the deadly diseases they transmit. Rising temperatures allow mosquitoes to grow faster and live longer. Whereas before they would die out during harsh winters in many places, now they have a greater shot at surviving and more time to build up their populations. Heat also speeds up the time it takes for a parasite or virus to mature inside a mosquito. “The hotter the temperature gets, the shorter that process becomes. So not only are these mosquitoes living longer, but they’re potentially becoming infectious sooner,” said Oliver Brady, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. They gain other benefits from heat, too. When it’s hotter, more people tend to be outside in the morning and late in the afternoon – prime time for mosquitoes. Heat is also pushing cities to increase their amount of green space, which has a vital cooling effect but could also provide ideal new breeding grounds for the blood-sucking insects. In the US, the number of “mosquito days” – those with the hot and humid conditions they love – has increased across the country, according to a recent analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group. Researchers looked at data spanning more than four decades in nearly 250 locations and found that more than 70% of them had become more hospitable to mosquitoes. While most of the approximately 200 mosquito species in the US are harmless, there are about a dozen which can pass on diseases to humans, including chikungunya, dengue, zika and West Nile viruses. While serious mosquito-borne diseases recmain rare in the US, other countries are not so lucky. In sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria has had devastating consequences, climate change is helping mosquitoes expand their range significantly, according to recent research. Malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes have, on average, moved to higher elevations by around 21 feet a year and southward by nearly 3 miles a year, a Georgetown University report found. It’s a pace that follows climate change and could have significant consequences for areas that have never experienced malaria before and are likely to be unprepared, said Colin Carlson, a global change biologist at Georgetown University and co-author of the report. Dengue fever is another potentially deadly disease, which is poised to increase in a warmer world. Also known as “breakbone fever,” it causes fever, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and diarrhea and, in some cases, internal bleeding and death. There is no cure or specific treatment for dengue, leaving sufferers little choice but to ride out the symptoms. Peru is currently grappling with the worst outbreak of mosquito-borne dengue fever on record, which has infected around 150,000 people and killed more than 250. Experts have said that unusually high levels of rainfall and warmth have provided ideal conditions for the mosquitoes. While scientists are yet to assess the role climate change has played in the outbreak, Carlson said the links seem clear. “I’m not a betting man, and I would put money on when we go and do that study, it will be climate change,” he said. Now dengue is knocking on the door of Europe and the US. “A billion new people will be exposed to the right weather conditions for dengue transmission, and most of those people are in Western Europe and the United States and temperate China,” said Carlson. There have been locally spread outbreaks in Texas, Florida, Hawaii and Arizona. And last week, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control warned that the Aedes albopictus species – which can transmit dengue and chikungunya – is pushing northwards and westwards in Europe as climate change grips the world’s fastest warming continent. “What is surprising is the speed of the spread,” Celine Gossner, principal expert in emerging and vector-borne diseases at the ECDC, told CNN. In just a decade, the number of regions where this mosquito is established has increased three-fold, she said. Even with this new exposure, however, the US and Europe are unlikely to see huge outbreaks, or large numbers of fatalities from dengue virus. “The story of future change is really more about big increases in areas that already have dengue, that’s going to get much worse,” Brady said. He pointed to China and parts of India as particularly at risk. “That’s a really scary situation because vast numbers of people live in these areas and even minor changes could potentially be catastrophic,” he said. Communities already on the front lines of the climate crisis are always going to be most affected by mosquito-borne disease, and that is where investment should be directed, said Shannon LaDeau, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystems Studies. But the shift of mosquito-borne diseases into regions like the US and Europe is still likely to be a shock. “Folks that live in the temperate zone are going to see their way of life change pretty dramatically because they’ve never had to worry about it before,” LaDeau told CNN. The climate crisis is not all upside for mosquitoes. Some places may simply be getting too hot. “There’s some threshold after which the chemistry in their body just doesn’t function anymore,” LaDeau said. The bad news is that these places are likely to be getting too hot for humans, too. There is still much that remains unknown about how mosquitoes will react to the climate crisis. The relationship between climate change and disease is complex, Gossner said. We know a lot about how temperature changes mosquitoes’ ability to transmit disease, a small amount about how quickly mosquitoes are moving to new places and very little about whether overall mosquito populations are growing, Carlson said. Scientists are working to develop tools to be able to better assess the link between mosquito-borne diseases and climate change. In the meantime, there are ways people can protect themselves from risk, including wearing mosquito repellent, putting screens on windows and doors and getting rid of any stagnant water from places like flowerpots and gutters. Scientists are also working on high-tech methods to reduce populations. A project in Florida has been trialing a genetically modified mosquito designed to pass on a lethal gene that kills female mosquitoes – which are the ones that bite. Other experiments involve using wolbachia bacteria, which can prevent viruses replicating inside a mosquito, making them less likely to transmit viruses. There are also vaccines on the horizon for diseases such as dengue and malaria. “That’s a really big deal,” said Carlson. But whether these will be shared equitably around the world is another question, he added. “It’s a long road to try to understand how better to use those tools. But there’s a lot of hope on the horizon,” Brady said. Ultimately, tackling climate change will have a huge impact. The path the world takes on reducing planet-heating pollution will lead to very different futures for mosquito-borne diseases, Brady said. “Aggressive [climate] mitigation would be by far the lowest risk.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/30/business/gas-prices-july-4th-travel/index.html,Fourth of July gas prices take an almost unprecedented plunge,06-30-2023,"                                                 The roads will be crowded this Fourth of July weekend, but travelers have at least one thing going for them: much cheaper gas prices than last year.                                             ","Matt Egan, CNN","The roads will be crowded this Fourth of July weekend, but travelers have at least one thing going for them: much cheaper gas prices than last year. A record-setting 43.2 million Americans are expected to travel by car this holiday weekend, according to AAA. That’s 2.4% higher than last Fourth of July. And yet gasoline prices are much lower. The national average for regular gasoline dipped to $3.55 a gallon on Thursday, according to AAA. A year ago, a gallon of regular sold for an average of $4.87 a gallon. That kind of price drop is almost unprecedented. During the week ending June 26, the average gas price was $3.57 a gallon, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That’s down by $1.30, or 27%, from the same period last year. This is the second-biggest one-year price drop in the week before the Fourth of July since EIA data began 33 years ago, according to John LaForge, who leads real asset strategy for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The only bigger 12-month drop occurred during a historic downturn: the Great Recession. Gas prices plunged by $1.45 a gallon, or 35%, between June 30, 2008 and June 29, 2009. “This is terrific. Gasoline prices are a leading economic indicator for many Americans,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. The average motorist is spending $20 less per fill-up than at this point last year, De Haan said. Although pump prices have retreated from last year’s record highs, gas prices were cheaper in the summer of 2021 and certainly in 2020 when Covid-19 shut down large swaths of the economy. Still, over the past 12 months, gas prices are down in all 50 states, according to AAA. Drivers in Indiana have enjoyed the biggest drop in gas prices over the past year, with the state average tumbling by $1.58 a gallon. Other states with big gas price drops include Ohio ($1.48), California ($1.47) and Illinois ($1.47), according to AAA. The smallest 12-month decline in gas prices was in the state of Washington, where the average is only down by 50 cents a gallon. Washington recently replaced California with the unwanted distinction of having America’s most expensive gas prices. Of course, consumers are still grappling with a high cost of living at the grocery store, when shopping for cars and paying rent. “Americans have been hit by so many other bullets. They might save at the pump but they are spending more elsewhere,” said De Haan. High inflation elsewhere is a central reason De Haan anticipates gasoline demand over the Fourth of July weekend will be 5% to 10% below 2019 levels. That’s despite the fact that AAA expects the number of people driving to their destinations this weekend will be 4% higher than in 2019. To ease the pain of high gas prices and cushion the blow from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has released unprecedented amounts of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Now, the Energy Department has begun a years-long process of replenishing an emergency stockpile that has shrunk to the lowest level in 40 years. The administration bought another 3.2 million barrels of oil for the SPR, a person familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday. The oil is set to be delivered in September and cost an average of $71.98 a barrel, the source told CNN. That’s well below the average of about $95 that SPR crude sold for last year. The Energy Department has now repurchased 6.2 million barrels for the SPR. But that is just a tiny fraction of the 289 million barrels drained from the SPR through Congressionally mandated sales and emergency sales since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021. The tumble in gas prices is an undeniable positive for consumers. However, not all the factors behind the drop are encouraging. After spiking last year, oil prices have plunged in part due to concerns about the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes slowing the economy into a recession. Another factor: Despite fears of disruptions, Russia’s oil exports have not been derailed by the war in Ukraine or sanctions from the West. “We believe prices are stuck in the near term,” Wells Fargo’s LaForge said, “as markets weigh concerns of an expected recession against global supply.” But beyond that, LaForge anticipates the oil market will get tighter and “push prices higher” next year. One wildcard is the war in Ukraine following the short-lived Wagner uprising in Russia that poses a challenge to Vladimir Putin’s grip on power. So far, the oil market has largely shrugged off the unrest in Russia, with traders betting that country’s exports will remain intact. But GasBuddy’s De Haan says Russia remains a source of risk for gas prices. “The situation is still a bit of a powder keg. It could lead to more explosiveness in oil prices,” he said."

","Taylor Ward and Monica Garrett, CNN","A heat wave in parts of the South and Mississippi Valley is peaking and a new one is building in the West on Friday, putting more than 70 million people in those areas under heat alerts ahead of the holiday weekend. More dangerous severe thunderstorms and areas of heavy rain along the northern side of the heat dome are forecast to track eastward from the Central Plains to the Ohio Valley and eventually the mid-Atlantic over the next couple of days, bringing some heat relief, but also the risk of damaging storms and additional power outages. In the mid- to lower Mississippi River Valley and the Deep South, temperatures on Friday will again near or top 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee; Birmingham, Alabama; Little Rock, Arkansas; and New Orleans are under excessive heat warnings, as heat and humidity may combine to make temperatures feel like 105 to 115 degrees. This continues distressing, deadly heat that parts of the South have experienced for days. Eleven people died in recent days due to heat-related illnesses in Texas’ Webb County, which includes Laredo, and at least two people died from the heat in Louisiana’s Caddo Parish this month, officials said. Parts of Texas have sweltered under triple-digit temperatures for more than two weeks – but the state is seeing signs of relief. Dallas was not under any heat alert Friday morning as temperatures there dip to more typical summer values. “Although a few locations across Central and East Texas may reach advisory criteria, the prevalence of 105 heat indices will be far less widespread, and our protracted stretch of advisories/warnings for heat will come to an end,” the National Weather Service office in Dallas said. Heat across the rest of the South is expected to follow a similar pattern to Dallas, with slight relief slowly occurring over the holiday weekend. “An increase in showers and thunderstorms this weekend into next week during peak heating will bring some relief from the heat as the upper-level ridge weakens slightly across the region,” the National Weather Service office in Memphis said. Rounds of storms each day “will begin to erode the upper ridge (heat dome) responsible for the ongoing heat wave across the South and help bringing cooler air ever so slowly east across the Central Plains,” the Weather Prediction Center said Friday morning. But the trade-off is rounds of dangerous storms. Damaging winds and large hail are the main threats today as storms move around the periphery of the heat dome parked over the South. Denver, Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, are in a Level 1 of 5 risk on Friday. A level 2 of 5 slight risk of severe storms stretches from Colorado to Kentucky on Friday, including Colorado Springs, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Nashville, Tennessee. Thunderstorm complexes with heavy downpours, hail and damaging wind gusts will develop over the mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys Saturday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. On Saturday, a level 3 of 5 enhanced risk of severe storms covers portions of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, including St. Louis and Louisville. Damaging winds and large hail are the most likely threat with these storms. A Level 2 of 5 risk stretches farther east to the Virginias, Carolinas and Georgia. By Sunday, storms look to target the Ohio Valley into the mid-Atlantic where a Level 2 of 5 risk is already highlighted. Philadelphia, Washington, DC, and Indianapolis are included. As parts of the South begin to see some relief, heat in the West is building. Millions across Las Vegas and Phoenix will be under excessive heat warnings beginning Saturday, with temperatures projected to soar above 110 degrees for both locations this weekend. And many parts of California are under excessive heat warnings or heat advisories. Las Vegas has gone a record-breaking 293 consecutive days without reaching 100 degrees, but is forecast to top 100 degrees today, and shoot up to 110 degrees by Sunday and beyond. “This heat should be taken seriously and precautions need to be taken to prevent heat-related illnesses,” the National Weather Service office in Las Vegas warned. “Avoid outdoor activity during the hottest parts of the day (10 a.m. - 4 p.m.), drink extra water, take breaks in cool or shady locations, and wear light colored, light weight clothing.” More than 600 people in the US are killed by extreme heat every year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As human-induced climate change forces temperatures to rise around the globe, officials urge people to take safety precautions during heat waves, including staying hydrated, avoiding leaving pets and kids in cars unattended and finding cool, indoor spaces to wait out the high temperatures. CNN’s Aya Elamroussi contributed to this report."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/30/weather/nighttime-heat-danger-climate-change-xpn-scn/index.html,Why nighttime heat can be so dangerous – and why it’s getting worse,06-30-2023,                                                 Forecasters are warning that there is a more dangerous aspect to heat waves these days: overnight temperatures are not cooling down enough                                             ,"Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Summers are getting hotter than ever, shattering all-time high temperature records, straining the energy grid and damaging critical infrastructure. Heat waves also are coming to include another increasingly dangerous element: overnight temperatures that don’t cool down enough to offer sufficient reprieve from oppressive heat, particularly for people without access to air conditioning. “Most people don’t realize that hot nighttime temperatures have been outpacing daytime temperature increases across most populated regions worldwide in recent decades,” Columbia University’s Data Science Institute postdoctoral research scientist Kelton Minor told CNN. Hotter nights are a consequence of the climate crisis, scientists have warned. On average, nights are warming faster than days in most of the United States, the 2018 National Climate Assessment found. “We think it’s because as the days grow warmer, there is more moisture in the air that traps the heat,” the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health’s executive director, Lisa Patel, told CNN. “During the day, that moisture reflects the heat, but at night, it traps the heat in.” Increasing nighttime heat is even more common in cities because of the urban heat island effect, in which metro areas are significantly hotter than their surroundings. Places with a lot of asphalt, concrete, buildings and freeways absorb more of the sun’s heat than areas with ample parks, rivers and tree-lined streets. At night, when temperatures are supposed to cool down, the retained heat is released back into the air, said University of Washington climate and health expert Kristie Ebi. Areas with a lot of green space – with grass and trees that reflect sunlight and create shade – are cooler on summer’s hottest days, she said. “Many cities put together cooling shelters, but people have to know where they are, how to get to them and what hours they operate,” Ebi told CNN, noting city officials must rethink urban planning to consider climate change. “It’s going to take a while for trees to grow, but we need tree-planting programs focusing on places that are particularly vulnerable, making sure that city planning takes into account that we’re heading into a much warmer future.” Nighttime should be when our bodies get a break from the heat, Patel said. But with the climate crisis, it’s becoming less likely to happen. Heat-related deaths could increase sixfold by the end of the century due to warmer nighttime temperatures, unless planet-warming pollution is significantly curbed, a 2022 study in the Lancet Planetary Health found. The climate crisis is already affecting people’s ability to sleep, said Minor, co-author of a study that found people living in warmer climates lose more sleep for each degree of temperature increase. It was published in May in the journal One Earth. “We all know what it’s like to try to fall asleep on a hot night – it’s uncomfortable,” Patel said. “We often lose sleep. It is estimated that by the end of the century, we could lose about two days of sleep per year, and it will be worse for people without access to air conditioning.” At its most extreme, when a human body does not get the chance to recover – typically at night – heat stress can progress to heat stroke, which is associated with confusion, dizziness and passing out, Patel explained. People around the world are already losing roughly 44 hours of sleep every year on average due to warm nighttime temperatures during just the first part of the 21st century, Minor’s study estimated. He calls this “sleep erosion,” noting each person may lose up to 58 hours of sleep by the end of the century. “People in our study did not appear to make up for lost sleep on hotter nights by napping during the day or by sleeping more during the days or weeks after,” Minor said. “In fact, they lost additional sleep over these periods due to a delayed temperature effect, possibly due to ambient heat being trapped indoors.” And much like other social issues, the impacts don’t fall equally across communities, he said. “For every degree of nighttime temperature rise, we found that the elderly lost over twice as much sleep as middle-aged adults, females lost slightly more sleep than males, and critically, residents of lower-middle-income countries lost three times as much sleep compared to people living in higher income countries,” Minor said. Heat waves that go on for several days tend to be associated with more deaths as the body can no longer keep itself cool, Patel said. And unless planet-warming pollution is curbed, the climate crisis is set to increase exposure to dangerous heat index levels by 50% to 100% in much of the tropics and by up to 10 times across much of the globe, according to a 2022 study published in Communications Earth & Environment. “Living through a heat wave during the day can be like running a race,” Patel said. “We need a cool break to recover and recuperate, and when nighttime temperatures don’t drop, we don’t get that critical time we need to relieve the stress on our bodies from being overheated during the day.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/01/us/canada-wildfire-smoke-us-air-quality/index.html,Smoke will keep pouring into the US as long as fires are burning in Canada. Here’s why they aren’t being put out,07/02/2023,"                                                 Another wave of wildfire smoke has drifted into the US, dimming blue summer skies and igniting troubling concerns regarding the increasing frequency of fires, and what they have to do with climate change.                                             ","Alaa Elassar, CNN","Another wave of wildfire smoke has drifted into the US, dimming blue summer skies and igniting troubling concerns regarding the increasing frequency of fires, and what they have to do with climate change. More than 100 million people are under air quality alerts from Wisconsin to Vermont and down to North Carolina as smoke from Canadian wildfires continues to waft south, though conditions are expected to improve slowly into the holiday weekend. Map: Track air quality across the US Air quality on both sides of the border has been affected as more than 500 active wildfires raging across Canada. Some fires are so out of control officials have no choice but to leave them burning. Meanwhile, at least 10 countries have deployed their own firefighters to assist Canada with putting out the ones threatening communities whose residents have scrambled to evacuate. Scientists continue to reiterate warnings the effects of climate change have arrived, emphasizing wildfires and the plumes of toxic smoke generated by them will become more frequent. As plumes of smoke billow out of Canada’s forests, some may be wondering why many of the fires are being allowed to burn unchecked. Here’s why: While every Canadian province responds to the fires in their regions differently, they all have common guidelines emphasizing the importance of prioritizing which fires to fight and which to leave alone. Massive fires burning in remote areas – like some of those currently burning in northwestern Quebec – are often too out of control to do anything about. “If you have limited resources, and you have a lot of fires, what you do is you protect human life and property first,” Robert Gray, a Canadian wildland fire ecologist, told CNN. “You protect people, infrastructure, watersheds, so there’s a prioritization system.” He added, “If you’ve got these fires that are burning way out in the back forty, and they’re not threatening anything immediately, then you’re going to have to let them do their thing.” While the thought of massive fires burning through millions of hectares of forestland might sound unfathomable, it isn’t entirely new. “There’s always been fires Canadian fire managers don’t fight. It’s expensive to do so, ecologically undesirable, and kind of just messing with nature,” said Daniel Perrakis, a fire scientist with the Canadian Forest Service. “The smoke is a problem but even if we wanted to do something about it, it wouldn’t really be clear how to do so. You’re talking about huge areas where there’s no road access, no communities in some cases.” Of the 522 fires currently burning, 262 are listed as out of control across Canada, including British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. Along with remoteness and distance from people, terrain is another factor. Some of the fires are being allowed to burn simply because they are too treacherous for firefighters to even attempt to tackle. “These fires are so big that you really can’t put people anywhere near them, the winds kick up, they move very fast, they can start out ahead of you and they can trap crews,” Gray said. Firefighters from at least 10 countries, including the US, Mexico, Costa Rica, Chile, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea, and France, have been deployed to assist with the Canadian wildfires since the first week of June. “Canada doesn’t have a lot of firefighting resources,” Gray said. “Individual provinces have their own contracting crews, but they have brought in thousands of folks from outside the country to help.” One factor contributing to the lack of resources, evident in the current fight against the out of control fires, is funding, Gray acknowledged. “They don’t typically appropriate a lot of money upfront for firefighting,” he continued. “But once the fires break out, the governments can certainly find all the money necessary to suppress them.” “International groups keep saying, you need to shift the focus to upfront mitigation and prevention so you’re spending less money on response and recovery,” he added. “It’s ridiculous. We spend billions of dollars once the fire breaks out, but we don’t invest the money upfront to mitigate the fires from happening in the first place.” More work needs to be done to reduce the opportunity for future wildfires, which may someday end in catastrophic tragedy. One of the most effective fire prevention tactics is through prescribed burns, which are fires set intentionally as part of a forest management plan to reduce the risk of more serious and damaging blazes. “We don’t do anywhere near enough prescribed burning in BC,”  Gray said. “Right now we’re burning about 10,000 hectares a year. The state of New Jersey burns more than we do here at BC.” Prescribed burns have been an important cultural and environmental tradition in Indigenous communities, who for thousands of years set low-intensity fires to rid the land of wildfire fuel like debris, scrub, undergrowth and certain grasses. Such fuel ignites easily, allowing for more intense flames, which are harder to fight. The intentional burning practices can increase the forests’ resiliency and decrease the likelihood of future wildfires. Perrakis echoed Gray’s sentiments: “It would be very useful to have maybe 10 times or 20 times more prescribed burning than what we’re doing presently.” Since prescribed burns come with liability issues and pose a risk of ending in accidental unmanageable fires if not done correctly and at the right time, this will require more funding from the government and proper training. “We would be removing the fuel from the fire before there’s even a fire,” Perrakis said. “It wouldn’t be used all across the Canadian countryside, but very strategically around communities and other values and will be in line with the local ecosystem.” Along with prescribed burns, other tactics, like large scale thinning, need to be ramped up, Gray said. “We need large scale thinning in these forest types that don’t produce a lot of dimension lumber, so there’s a lot of small trees and we need to come to do something with them,” he added. “We can ship them into the bioeconomy, produce bioenergy markets, engineering, wood products; there’s a lot of things we can do with low value wood, and that’s a lot of what’s out there burning up right now.” Fires have always served a vital ecological purpose on Earth, essential for many ecosystems. They restore soil nutrients, helping germinate plants and remove decaying matter. Without fires, overgrown foliage like grasses and shrubs can prime the landscape for worse flare-ups, particularly during extreme drought and heat waves. Most of Canada is covered by boreal forest, the world’s largest and most intact biome. The ecosystem with trees like spruce, pine, and fir makes up about one-third of all forests on the planet. But it is a fire dependent ecosystem, meaning the species in the forest have evolved in the presence of fire, and fire “is an essential process for conserving biodiversity,” according to the Nature Conservancy. “We have records as far back as the 1700s and 1800s of yellow sky and black sky and smoky sky days.” he added. “It’s the natural cycle of the boreal forest. There really isn’t much Canadian fire management agencies can do, even if they wanted to.” While natural fires in the system have always been present and are usually caused by natural elements like lightning, climate change is making them more frequent, increasingly unmanageable, and a lot more difficult to prevent. One year ago, after enduring a record-breaking temperature of 121 degrees, the British Columbia village of Lytton was leveled by a wildfire, drawing stark attention to the effects of climate change. Heat-trapping emissions have led to hotter and drier conditions, and wildfires now burn longer and are becoming hotter in places where they have always occurred; meanwhile, fires are also igniting and spreading in unexpected places. “We know that the weather is the most important ingredient of fire behavior, and climate and weather are linked,” Perrakis said. Another issue is the increase in the wildfires are caused by climate change, and are simultaneously making climate change worse. Boreal forests are carbon dense, releasing 10 to 20 times more planet-heating carbon pollution for each unit of area burned by wildfires than other ecosystems, according to a 2022 study published in the journal Science Advances. Over the years, researchers say it has become a vicious climate change feedback loop. The emissions from wildfires contributes to increasing global temperatures, which in turn fuel even more wildfires. “Things are changing due to climate change, and that’s catching everyone somewhat by surprise, even though we’ve been talking about it for decades,” Perrakis said. “It takes a big season like this one for everyone to really wake up to what climate change looks like. It’s pretty undeniable.” As Canadians near the fires evacuate while firefighters try to save their homes and communities, other, bigger fires burn freely with no way to control them, and people in the US will continue breathing in unhealthy smoke. It all begs the question: When will it end? “People should probably get used to it, because it’s not something that has come out of nowhere,” Perrakis said. “Climate change is undeniable, and now it’s time to think about the future, 10 or 20 years down the line, and what needs to be done.”"

","Allison Chinchar, CNN Meteorologist","Mother Nature will threaten Fourth of July travel and holiday plans as severe storms, record heat and wildfire smoke converge on one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. AAA projects more than 50 million people will take to the roads or skies over the next few days, and millions of them will have to contend with potential disruptions from storms. More than 100 million people face the risk of damaging winds, tornadoes or hail in the next 48 hours. This, after tens of thousands of flight delays and thousands of flight cancellations have created travel chaos for more than a week. Atlanta, St Louis, Nashville, and Cincinnati face the biggest threat for air travel disruptions Saturday. For Sunday, storms in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic could cause interruptions to major airports in New York, Philadelphia and Washington, DC. A level 3 of 5 enhanced risk for severe storms is in place for portions of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, including St. Louis and Louisville on Saturday. By Sunday, the highest chance for severe storms stretches from western Kentucky to New Jersey. Strong storms are also a concern farther west in cities such as Denver, Colorado Springs and Cheyenne, Wyoming. The high pressure responsible for the ongoing heat wave across the South will erode as the severe storms shift eastward. That will help temperatures drop ever so slowly east across the central US. But as temperatures begin to cool down in some areas this weekend, others will actually see temperatures spike. At least 20 record-high temperatures could be broken this weekend across California, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Afternoon highs on Saturday in areas of California and the desert Southwest will climb well into the triple digits and even exceed 110 degrees in the hottest locations. Remarkably, Friday was the first time Las Vegas hit triple digits so far this year – a record long wait. The last time Las Vegas waited this long for triple digit heat was “58 years ago on June 30, 1965,” the National Weather Service office in Las Vegas said. The first heat wave could catch people off guard, increasing the risk of heat-related illness. “This rapid rise in temperatures will result in a major risk of heat-related impacts for anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration,” the National Weather Service office said. Overnight low temperatures will also be exceptionally warm this weekend and pose more danger. “Your body requires cooling off at night, and actually expects it while you’re sleeping,” said Jenn Varian, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Las Vegas. “When we have very warm overnight temperatures, your body is simply not able to cool off properly, which in (and) of itself can cause complications, but will set you up to be less prepared for the daytime heat as well.” Nighttime temperatures need to drop to at least 80 degrees for heat recovery to begin. In fact, a sweating person can lose up to two liters of fluid overnight if the temperature never drops below 85 degrees. Both the Saturday and Sunday overnight low temperatures will only get down to the mid-80s for cities like Las Vegas, Phoenix and Palm Springs, California. Even cities farther east won’t fare much better. New Orleans, Houston and Key West, Florida, are expected to bottom out in the low 80s. If extreme heat and severe storms weren’t enough, there’s still the Canadian wildfire smoke to contend with in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. The good news is that storms and smoke dispersion will help slowly improve air quality over the weekend from very unhealthy and unhealthy levels down to moderate level and levels unhealthy for sensitive groups."

Wolf, CNN","A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Climate change combined with this year’s El Niño set a new world record for worldwide heat on Tuesday – 62.92 degrees Fahrenheit or 17.18 degrees Celsius. The low 60s may not sound that hot to anyone sweating through a summer heat wave, but the figure is almost a full degree Celsius above the average between 1979 and 2000 and represents a new indicator that Earth’s climate is heating up faster than anticipated. Looking at the graphic in CNN’s report that tracks annual global temperatures, the hottest part of the year has not arrived. Expect more worldwide records before the fall. The record was first set on Monday, when the average global temperature reached 17.01 degrees Celsius (62.62 degrees Fahrenheit), per the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction’s data. The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which also tracks global temperatures using a different method, tweeted that Monday was a record in its data set, with a global temperature of 16.88 degrees Celsius. The climate science consensus that world governments should seek to contain rising temperatures to within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels seems more and more unattainable. The World Meteorological Organization, the Switzerland-based agency of the United Nations, said back in May that there is a two-thirds likelihood that temperatures would shoot past that 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold within the next five years. The cyclical phenomenon occurs when warm Pacific waters flow toward the west coast of the Americas and affect temperatures worldwide. The WMO declared the onset of an El Niño Tuesday and warned governments to prepare for more extreme weather events as a result. This will be the first El Niño in seven years. The last very strong El Niño year – 2016 – also saw the previous record for worldwide heat that August. It’s hard to believe, but the last few years, despite being among the hottest on record, were La Niña years, which should have relatively low temperatures. Asked about the new record on CNN International, CNN’s chief climate correspondent Bill Weir said countries will need to work on adapting to the new climate as much as trying to mitigate climate change. “Unfortunately, the planet we grew up on, those dependable seasons, we’re not going back to that,” he said. He noted that there were heat records set around the planet this week including scorching temperatures over 120 degrees Fahrenheit (around 50 degrees Celsius) in parts of Africa. But relatively hot temperatures in other places around the world are important to chart. “Yesterday, way up in the Arctic Circle … the northernmost tip of Quebec, it was warmer than Miami,” Weir said. “And at the same time, at the bottom of the planet, which is supposed to be the polar opposite – it’s winter down there – they set a high temperature record as well. So we’re seeing it all over the planet.” John Abraham is a climate scientist and professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. He appeared after Weir on CNN International and was asked how these new records affect the target of keeping temperatures within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we are going to blow through that target,” he said, adding humans are not doing enough to slow down greenhouse gas emissions after decades of burning fossil fuels. “It has been years and years of emitting the stuff into the atmosphere,” he said. “The heat is accumulating, and we are seeing the records that scientists have been predicting would occur many decades ago.” He also offered an interesting framing for how to view rising temperatures: not as a steady ramp, but rather in steps. “They rise like steps, like you are going up steps to get from the first floor to the second floor of a house,” Abraham said. “Every few years, the temperatures step up, and then they hold constant for a few years, and then they step up again.” Steps up, he said, coincide with El Niño events like this year’s. “It is El Niño on top of decades of human emissions of greenhouse gases.” There is no turning back, he said, but humans can likely slow the change. “We can change the trajectory,” Abraham said. “We can change how fast it rises, but we can’t arrest the rising.” I was somewhat surprised to hear Abraham close on a positive note, arguing the world is “at a tipping point right now in the economics of clean energy.” “You can now power your homes and your businesses and your cars with solar and wind power just as cheaply as with coal,” he argued. “In the old days, if you took climate change seriously, it was a personal, moral, ethical statement you were making. Now, it’s a financial statement you are making.” While the US and state governments have tried to incentivize people and companies to embrace lower-emission options, they are not yet as affordable as carbon-emitting alternatives. Plus, there is a documented push to seek out fossil fuel reserves by oil and gas companies, as Reuters documented this week. Or, more to the point of how oil and gas continue to influence the US economy: As world authorities were charting record worldwide temperatures, economic authorities saw gas prices dipping ahead of the July Fourth holiday as a major boon for inflation-weary consumers."

It’s a record that will be broken again and again,07/06/2023,"                                                 This week’s global temperature records are probably the warmest in at least 100,000 years, one climate scientist explained.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","This week saw the hottest global temperature ever recorded, according to data from two climate tracking agencies that covers multiple decades. On Monday, the average global temperature reached 17.01 degrees Celsius (62.62 Fahrenheit), the highest in the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction’s data, which goes back to 1979. On Tuesday, it climbed even further, reaching 17.18 degrees Celsius and global temperature remained at this record-high on Wednesday. The previous record of 16.92 degrees Celsius was set in August 2016. The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service confirmed that Monday’s and Tuesday’s global temperatures were also records in its data, which dates back to 1940. While these global temperature records are based on data sets that go back to the mid-20th century, they are almost certainly the warmest the planet has seen over a much longer time period, some scientists say, given what we know from many millennia of climate data extracted from ice cores and coral reefs. This week’s records are probably the warmest in “at least 100,000 years,” Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, told CNN, calling the records “a huge thing.” Experts warn that the record could be broken several more times this year. Robert Rohde, lead scientist at Berkeley Earth, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday that the world “may well see a few even warmer days over the next 6 weeks.” This global record is a preliminary one, but it’s another indication of how fast the world is heating up. The arrival of the natural climate phenomenon El Niño, which has a warming effect, is layering on top of the climate crisis to drive temperatures higher. “It’s not a record to celebrate and it won’t be a record for long, with northern hemisphere summer still mostly ahead and El Niño developing,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in the UK. This year has already seen heat records broken around the world, with devastating consequences. In the US, Texas and the South sweltered in a brutal heat wave in late June, with triple-digit-Fahrenheit temperatures and extreme humidity. Soaring temperatures in Mexico have killed at least 112 people since March. A searing heat wave in India killed at least 44 people across the state of Bihar. China, too, has experienced several blistering heat waves and it registered the highest number of hot days – where the maximum daily temperature exceeded 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) – over a six-month period since records began. The UK recorded the hottest June since records began in 1884, according to the country’s national weather service, the Met Office. The average temperature for the month was 15.8 degrees Celsius (60.4 Fahrenheit), breaking the previous record by 0.9 degree Celsius. “Alongside natural variability, the background warming of the Earth’s atmosphere due to human induced climate change has driven up the possibility of reaching record high temperatures,” Paul Davies, Met Office climate extremes principal fellow and chief meteorologist, said in a statement. As the climate crisis intensifies, scientists are clear that record-breaking heat waves are set to become more frequent and more severe. The new global average temperature record is another wake-up call, Otto told CNN. “It just shows we have to stop burning fossil fuels, not in decades, now. This day is just a number, but for many people and ecosystems it’s a loss of life and livelihood.” This story has been updated with additional information and the latest news on the record."

","Helen Regan, CNN","Governments must prepare for more extreme weather events and record temperatures in the coming months, the World Meteorological Organization warned Tuesday, as it declared the onset of the warming phenomenon El Niño. El Niño is a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific Ocean that brings warmer-than-average sea-surface temperatures and has a major influence on weather across the globe, affecting billions of people. “The onset of El Niño will greatly increase the likelihood of breaking temperature records and triggering more extreme heat in many parts of the world and in the ocean,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. The declaration “is the signal to governments around the world to mobilize preparations to limit the impacts on our health, our ecosystems and our economies.” To save lives and livelihoods, governments must establish early warning systems and prepare for further disruptive weather events this year, he said. The last three years have been some of the warmest on record, even with El Niño’s sister phase, La Niña – which is marked by cooler-than-average ocean temperatures. A “double whammy” of a very strong El Niño and human-caused warming from the burning of fossil fuels led to 2016 becoming the hottest year on record, according to the WMO, the United Nations’ agency for weather, climate and water resources. But the first El Niño to develop in seven years layered on top of human-caused global heating, could push 2023 or 2024 to break 2016’s heat record, the WMO said. The WMO said there was a 90% probability of El Niño continuing during the second half of 2023 at moderate strength. Along with increased ocean warming, El Niño events are usually associated with increased rainfall in parts of southern South America, the southern United States, the Horn of Africa and central Asia. But it can also amplify severe droughts, heat waves and wildfires over Australia, Indonesia, parts of southern Asia, Central America and northern South America. Other impacts include dangerous tropical cyclones in the Pacific and the mass bleaching of fragile coral reefs. In India, a major rice producing nation, El Niño can weaken the monsoon that brings the rainfall the country relies on to fill aquifers and grow crops. El Niño this year could also dent US economic growth, potentially impacting everything from food prices to winter clothing sales, a recent study found. The study attributed $5.7 trillion in global income losses to the 1997-98 El Niño and $4.1 trillion in losses to the 1982-83 El Niño. The world could also be temporarily pushed past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels – a key tipping point beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically. Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius – compared to pre-industrial temperatures. But the world has already seen around 1.2 degrees Celsius of warming, as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and produce planet-heating pollution. According to the WMO there is a 66% likelihood that the annual average near-surface global temperature between 2023 and 2027 will temporarily be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels for at least one year. “This is not to say that in the next five years we would exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius level specified in the Paris Agreement because that agreement refers to long-term warming over many years,” said WMO director of climate services Chris Hewitt. “However, it is yet another wake up call, or an early warning, that we are not yet going in the right direction to limit the warming to within the targets set in Paris in 2015 designed to substantially reduce the impacts of climate change.” A multitude of climate records have already been broken in 2023, with soaring temperatures, unusually hot oceans and record high levels of carbon pollution in the atmosphere and record low levels of Antarctic ice. Across Asia, Europe and the Americas, early and prolonged heat waves this year have killed people, animals and crops, sparked concerns about food security and water scarcity, and set the stage for unprecedented wildfires. CNN’s Laura Paddison and Rachel Ramirez contributed reporting."

That could all change this week,07/06/2023,                                                 The cellphone in your hand; the shoes on your feet; the chair you’re sitting on – there’s a good chance these made their way to you on one of the gigantic cargo ships that criss-cross the world’s oceans every day.                                             ,"Laura Paddison, CNN","The cellphone in your hand; the shoes on your feet; the chair you’re sitting on – there’s a good chance these made their way to you on one of the gigantic cargo ships that criss-cross the world’s oceans every day. The shipping industry is a behemoth, transporting more than 80% of the world’s traded goods in tens of thousands of huge vessels powered by fossil fuels. As a result, its climate impact is enormous: It produces around 3% of all human-caused planet-heating pollution. And experts say the industry has flown under the radar when it comes to climate action. That could change this week. In an unassuming brown building on the River Thames in London, representatives from the 175 member states of the International Maritime Organization, the UN body that regulates global shipping, are gathered for a highly anticipated set of negotiations expected to conclude on Friday with a commitment to dramatically cut the industry’s planet-heating pollution. What’s decided here will have implications for the world’s ability to tackle the climate crisis. Some experts say – if the IMO gets it right – it will be the “climate deal of the decade.” Even though the amount of planet-heating pollution shipping currently produces is more than the whole of Germany, it “has been ignored for a long time,” said Faïg Abbasov, the director of shipping at the non-profit Transport & Environment. The industry was not directly included in the Paris Agreement on climate, nor does it currently have a pledge to reach net-zero emissions – which would mean removing from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as it emits. One reason that shipping has received less scrutiny than other transport-related industries, like aviation, is that few people have direct contact with it, Abbasov told CNN. “Maritime space is a bit of a Wild West because ships are out of sight, out of mind,” Abbasov said. The industry’s current climate commitment is to cut levels of planet-heating pollution in half by the middle of the century, compared to 2008 levels – ambition levels that have been criticized, including by UN secretary general António Guterres, as inadequate given the scale of the climate crisis. Shipping organizations deny a lack of ambition. Natasha Brown, the head of public information services at the IMO, said mandatory energy efficiency measures were introduced back in 2011. “The focus has been on cutting emissions for more than a decade,” she told CNN. The industry “takes its responsibility to reduce [its climate impact] very seriously,” said Stuart Neil, director of strategy and communications at the International Chamber of Shipping, the industry’s main international trade association. While the shipping industry has grown, the levels of planet-heating pollution it produces have grown much more slowly, he told CNN. Data from a 2020 IMO analysis of shipping emissions shows that while shipping activity steadily increased from 1990 to 2020, the industry’s carbon dioxide emissions began to plateau around 2008. Yet left unchecked, shipping’s emissions could increase by 50% by mid-century, according to an IMO assessment. That’s one reason there is such a high level of anticipation around the IMO talks. The negotiations are “perhaps the most significant moment in the shipping climate debate,” Abbasov said. John Maggs, the president of the Clean Shipping Coalition, went even further. “If they get it right, probably it will be the biggest climate deal of the year, if not the decade,” he told CNN. The key question is what the final commitment will look like. Some campaigners are calling for targets to reduce planet-heating pollution by 37% by 2030 and 96% by 2040, to keep the industry within Paris Agreement ambitions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Others want to decarbonize faster, calling for zero emissions by 2040. But certain countries, including China, India and Brazil – those that tend to ship a lot of raw materials, often over long distances – have been pushing back, arguing ambitious action could affect trade and undermine their economies, said Abbasov. In response, climate experts say these are short term costs and are dwarfed by the costs of tackling the climate crisis in these same countries. Maggs said on Monday that what was in the draft documents fell short of the strong targets he and others are pushing for. They included a commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and interim targets for a 20% reduction in emissions by 2030 and 70% by 2040. Ambitious interim targets are vital, Maggs said. “Absolutely without a shadow of a doubt, the 2030 target is the most important,” he said. Without a strong pledge, “all that’s going to happen is everybody’s going to sit on their hands for another 10 years,” he added. Shipping is often put in the category of industries that are very hard to make climate-friendly, because there are few easily available alternatives to the dense, tar-like heavy fuel oil on which ships run. Cargo ships are difficult to electrify because the batteries required to propel them across oceans would be enormous. Clean fuels are available, such as green hydrogen – which is made using renewable energy – but they are much more expensive. Abbasov said these fuels need more funds for research and development, but investors are waiting for a demand signal from the shipping industry. There is still plenty that the shipping industry can do right now and for relatively little cost, according to a recent analysis by the consultancy firm CE Delft. It found that the industry could slash planet-heating pollution nearly in half by 2030 at an extra cost of 10% compared to business-as-usual. It suggested three actions: reducing the speed of ships, as the slower they go, the less fuel they burn; retrofitting some ships to use modern sails or kites to take advantage of wind power; and increasing the amount of clean fuels used to make up around 5% to 10% of shipping fuel. There remains a “collective action” problem, Abbasov said. Companies don’t want to incur costs to make changes if others are still doing nothing. “The only way from our perspective to change that is through mandatory government regulation,” he said. Some governments are acting. Last year, the European Union agreed to add shipping to its carbon market, meaning ships traveling to or within the EU will be forced to pay for their planet-heating pollution. The bloc also agreed that ships will have to use a certain percentage of clean fuels. The idea of a carbon levy on shipping’s carbon pollution is also gaining traction. The idea is to both incentivize climate action and provide a fund that could be directed toward developing countries, which are facing the most significant impacts of the climate crisis, despite doing the least to cause it. The IMO will publish its final strategy document, including revised climate commitments on Friday. At the opening of the talks last week, the IMO secretary-general Kitack Lim urged delegates to “be ambitious and bold.” If the shipping industry fails to make significant climate commitments this week, it’s going to have big implications for global climate ambitions, Maggs said. “Shipping is a really, really big piece of the puzzle.” “At the end of the day, we’re all going to have to go to zero,” he added. “If the shipping industry makes that decision today, it’s going to be a relatively smooth path.

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Earth’s temperature was off the charts last month as an extreme heat wave scorched the Southern US and Mexico and ocean warmth soared to alarming levels, a new report shows. The analysis from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service found that last month was the planet’s hottest June by a “substantial margin” above the previous record, which was set in 2019. The nine hottest Junes have all occurred in the last nine years, according to the agency – evidence the human-caused climate crisis is driving temperatures to unprecedented levels. Copernicus also found that ocean surface temperatures were the warmest on record for June, driven mainly by exceptional warmth in the North Atlantic and a strengthening El Niño in the Pacific. The analysis came as data from global climate agencies suggested that the planet saw its hottest day on record earlier this week — first on Monday and then again on Tuesday. “This is alarming,” Jennifer Marlon, a climate scientist at the Yale School of Environment who was not involved with the analysis, told CNN. “It’s hard to imagine what summers will be like for our children and grandchildren in the next 20 years. This is exactly what global warming looks like.” Scientists have warned that these record temperatures bear the fingerprints of the climate crisis. And to make matters worse, the stars are aligning this year for many more records to be broken as El Niño, which also has a warming impact, pushes temperatures to unprecedented levels. Northwest Europe experienced record-breaking temperatures last, including the UK, which logged its hottest June on record, according to the UK Met Office. Temperatures in parts of Canada, the United States, Mexico, Asia and eastern Australia were “significantly” warmer than normal in June, according to the report. In the US, Texas and parts of the South experienced a brutal heat wave late in June, with triple-digit-Fahrenheit temperatures and extreme humidity. The heat, which stretched south to Central America, killed at least 112 people in Mexico since March. Extremely hot days — what could be considered the hottest days of the summer — are more frequent now than in 1970 in 195 locations across the US, according to the research group Climate Central. Of those locations, roughly 71% now face at least seven additional extremely hot days each year. The oceans continued a remarkable warming trend since the start of 2023, according to Thursday’s report. The North Atlantic recorded exceptionally warm ocean temperatures in June, with a category 4 marine heat wave — defined as “extreme” — observed around Ireland, the UK and in the Baltic Sea. While the rise in planet-warming pollution is a major driver of such extreme heat, scientists say El Niño is expected to crank ocean temperatures even higher this year. “The ocean warming is even more concerning because as the oceans warm, they expand, which means higher sea levels, larger storms surges and more flooding of coastal communities,” Marlon said. Last month was also wetter than average in most of southern Europe and parts of Iceland and Russia, with heavy rain causing floods in Turkey, Kosovo and Romania. Meanwhile, several parts of the world from eastern Europe and Scandinavia to much of north America saw drier than average conditions in June, with wildfires igniting in the Horn of Africa, Canada and parts of South America and Australia. Antarctic sea ice also hit its lowest extent for the month of June — at 17% below average — since satellite observations started, shattering the previous June record set just last year. According to Copernicus, the daily sea ice extent around Antarctica remained at “unprecedented low” levels for this time of year."

These alarming new records are likely the highest temperatures in “at least 100,000 years,” one scientist told CNN. The global average daily temperature climbed to 17.23 degrees Celsius (63.01 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday, according to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, which uses data from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction. It’s been a week of record-breaking temperatures. On Monday, the average global temperature reached 17.01 degrees Celsius (62.62 degrees Fahrenheit), the highest in the NCEP’s data, which goes back to 1979. On Tuesday it climbed to 17.18 degrees Celsius, where it remained on Wednesday. Before this week, the record in NCEP’s data was 16.92 degrees Celsius and was set in August 2016. Though this week’s records are not yet official, another global climate tracking agency confirmed several in its own data. The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said Monday’s and Tuesday’s global temperatures were also records in its data, which dates back to 1940. While the records are based on observational data sets that only go back to the mid-20th century, they are “almost certainly” the warmest temperatures the planet has seen over a much longer time period, according to Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center. Francis estimated that this week’s temperatures are the warmest “probably going back at least 100,000 years,” calling the records “a huge thing.” Scientists know this because of the many millennia of climate data extracted from proxies like tree rings, ice cores and coral reefs – data that is a cornerstone to their understanding of the climate system and how humans have contributed to rapid global warming since the industrial revolution. Robert Rohde, a lead scientist at Berkeley Earth who was one of the first to share that global temperatures were soaring this week, told CNN it’s very likely that “we’re going to keep seeing more of these records fall” this summer. July is typically the planet’s hottest month, but temperatures are already in overdrive because of the combination of El Niño – a natural climate phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean – and the human-caused climate crisis, which is driving global temperatures steadily higher. “It’s not a record to celebrate and it won’t be a record for long, with northern hemisphere summer still mostly ahead and El Niño developing,” Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in the UK, said earlier this week. “It just shows we have to stop burning fossil fuels, not in decades, now,” Otto said. Temperature records aren’t just numbers, “but for many people and ecosystems it’s a loss of life and livelihood.” Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter.

While the agreement, published on Friday, marks an increased climate ambition from a hugely polluting industry, experts have slammed the deal as woefully inadequate in the face of an escalating climate crisis. The shipping industry, which transports more than 80% of the world’s traded goods, produces around 3% of all human-caused planet-heating pollution due to the fossil fuels it uses to propel ships across the ocean. But until now, the industry has not had a commitment to reach net zero – which would mean removing from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as it emits. That changed on Friday, when the International Maritime Organization, the UN body that regulates global shipping, published a new climate strategy after days of negotiations between the organization’s 175 member states. In the new agreement – the 2023 IMO Strategy on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships – countries agreed shipping would reach net zero “by or around, i.e. close to 2050” depending on “national circumstances.” The plan also includes interim commitments under the heading “indicative checkpoints,” where countries would aim to reduce planet-heating pollution from shipping by at least 20% by 2030 and 70% by 2040, compared to 2008 levels. The document also refers to “striving” targets of a 30% cut by 2030 and an 80% cut by 2040. IMO secretary-general Kitack Lim said in a statement that the new climate strategy provides a “clear direction, a common vision, and ambitious targets.” Industry groups welcomed the deal. In a statement, Simon Bennett, deputy secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, said: “This week’s agreement is historic for our industry and sends a very strong message that the maritime sector is serious about achieving net zero and addressing dangerous climate change in line with the Paris Agreement.” Some Pacific Island nations celebrated the adoption of new targets. “These higher targets are the result of relentless, unceasing lobbying by ambitious Pacific islands, against the odds,” Albon Ishoda, special presidential envoy for the decarbonisation of maritime shipping from the Marshall Islands, said in a statement. “This outcome is far from perfect, but countries across the world came together and got it done,” Ralph Regenvanu, a Vanuatu politician, said in a statement. Many climate groups, however, were highly critical of what they see as a toothless plan and a missed opportunity. Some countries and climate experts had been calling for much more ambitious targets including a commitment to reduce planet-heating pollution by up to 50% by 2030 and nearly completely by 2040. John Maggs, the president of the Clean Shipping Coalition criticized the “vague and non-committal language” in the new climate strategy. “There is no excuse for this wish and a prayer agreement. They knew what the science required, and that a 50% cut in emissions by 2030 was both possible and affordable,” he said in a statement. Faïg Abbasov, from the non profit Transport & Environment, said the agreement was a missed opportunity.  “This week’s climate talks were reminiscent of rearranging the deckchairs on a sinking ship. The IMO had the opportunity to set an unambiguous and clear course towards the 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature goal, but all it came up with is a wishy-washy compromise,” he said in a statement. Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees – and preferably to 1.5 degrees – compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key threshold, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically. The IMO’s Lim said the strategy marked a “new chapter” for shipping, but added, “at the same time, it is not the end goal, it is in many ways a starting point for the work that needs to intensify even more over the years and decades ahead.”"

Since 1951, Beijing has seen temperatures rise above 40C (104F) on 11 days, and five of them occurred over the past two weeks. Globally, this week saw the hottest temperature ever recorded, according to data from two climate tracking agencies that covers multiple decades. The previous record was set in August 2016. Yellen said China’s support for existing multilateral climate institutions like the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Climate Investment Funds, alongside the United States and other partners, could improve their impact. The GCF is the main climate financing mechanism of the United Nations and helps developing countries to tackle climate change. In April, US President Joe Biden pledged a $1 billion contribution to the GCF and a $500 million investment to the Amazon Fund, an international conservation program to protect the Amazon rainforest from deforestation. Last year, China suspended climate talks with the US and took other countermeasures in response to then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August. Attending the climate roundtable event with Yellen in Beijing, US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns described her first day of meetings as “very productive.” He said he was looking forward to a visit by US climate envoy John Kerry but did not provide a timetable for the trip. Kerry would be the third Cabinet official from the Biden administration to travel to China, after Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who visited in June."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","The world is blasting through climate records as scientists sound the alarm: The likelihood is growing that 2023 could be the hottest year on record, and the climate crisis could be altering our weather in ways they don’t yet understand. And they are not holding back – “extraordinary,” “terrifying” and “uncharted territory” are just a few of the ways they have described the recent spike in global temperature. This week, the planet’s average daily temperature soared to highs unseen in modern records kept by two climate agencies in the US and Europe. While the records are based on data that only goes back to the mid-20th century, they are “almost certainly” the warmest the planet has seen over a much longer time period – “probably going back at least 100,000 years,” according to Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center. And they were far from the only climate superlatives scientists have reported this year. Last month, the world experienced its warmest June on record by a “substantial margin,” according to a report by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Ocean heat has been off the charts, with surface temperatures last month reaching record levels for June. Parts of the North Atlantic have seen an “unprecedented” marine heat wave, with temperatures up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than usual. And in Antarctica, where temperatures are running well-above average for this time of year, sea ice plunged to record low levels, which scientists have linked to the warm waters off the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The world is “walking into an uncharted territory,” Carlo Buontempo, the director of Copernicus, told CNN. “We have never seen anything like this in our life.” While scientists say the records are alarming, most are unsurprised – though frustrated their warnings have been mostly ignored for decades. “This is exactly what we’ve been expecting to see for a long time,” Francis told CNN. What the world is experiencing are the impacts of global warming combined with the El Niño climate phenomenon – the arrival of which the World Meteorological Organization officially confirmed on Wednesday. It works like this: As the world burns fossil fuels and pumps out planet-heating pollution, global temperatures are steadily warming. That leads to more intense heat waves along with a host of other impacts, such as more extreme weather, melting glaciers and rising sea levels. Superimposed on top of these long-term warming trends are natural climate fluctuations, the most significant of which are La Niña, which has a cooling effect, and El Niño, which has a heating effect. “So we have a naturally warm world plus the increasingly hot climate change signal,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in the UK. While the record temperatures may have been expected, the magnitude by which some have been broken has surprised some scientists. That this June was half a degree warmer than a typical June “is just extraordinary” for a global temperature record, said Buontempo. Usually these records – which are averages of temperatures all over the world for the entire month – are broken by a tenth or even hundredth of a degree. Still others have been caught off guard by the nature of extreme weather events. “We were expecting to see more and more frequent heat waves and floods and droughts around the world. But it’s the intensity of some of those events that is a bit surprising,” said Peter Stott, a science fellow in climate attribution at the UK’s Met Office. There’s “an increasing worry that climate change is not quite as linear as we might have thought,” he told CNN. Scientists are trying to work out if weather patterns themselves might be changing, making heat waves much more intense than climate models predict. While scientists cannot yet be definitive, some say this year is at least on pace to become the warmest on record. The stars are aligning for the record to fall. Historically, global heat records tend to topple in El Niño years, and the current record-holder, 2016, coincided with a strong El Niño. In May, a Berkeley Earth analysis put the chances of 2023 being the hottest on record at 54%. As last month turned out to be the hottest June on record, that percentage is going to increase, said Robert Rohde, a lead scientist at Berkeley Earth. By how much remains uncertain, he told CNN, “but it’s looking more likely than not that 2023 will be a record year.” Records are how the world keeps tabs on the climate crisis. Yet some scientists caution the attention given to these big numbers can overshadow the real-world hazards they amplify: Heat waves, floods and droughts becoming much more frequent, severe and long-lasting as the Earth heats up. “It’s quite frustrating,” Otto said. The world gets hung up on blockbuster records but “these heat records are not exciting numbers,” she told CNN. “They mean that people and ecosystems are dying, that people are losing their livelihoods, that agricultural land will be unusable.” The human impact of extreme weather this year has already been stark. At the end of June, Texas and the South sweltered in a triple digit heat wave with extreme humidity that made temperatures feel even hotter and made it harder for bodies to cool themselves. The heat extended to Mexico, where extreme temperatures killed at least 112 people between March and the end of June. China has been grappling with blistering temperatures for weeks. Beijing, which is facing one of its most brutal heat waves on record, saw temperatures soar past 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) this week. In India, parts of the north have been struggling with unrelenting heat, while nearly half a million in the country’s northeast have been affected by severe flooding that has triggered devastating landslides which have taken lives. “All of these kinds of extreme events are absolutely consistent with what we expect to see happening more often as we just continue to warm the globe,” Francis said. And as El Niño strengthens, we’re likely to see more extreme weather, she added, not just in the summer but also in the winter, when El Niños have the biggest influence on Northern Hemisphere weather. “I’d say buckle up.” For climate scientists, this is the “I told you so” moment they never wanted. “This needn’t have been happening,” Stott said. For decades, scientists have been warning about what would happen to global temperatures if the world failed to kick its fossil fuel habit and rein in planet-heating pollution. But they went unheeded, he said. To see climate change unfold in front of us “is terrifying,” he added, because “this will just carry on getting worse and worse, and more and more extreme. So what we’re seeing now is only a foretaste of what could happen if efforts to reduce emissions aren’t successful.” The only silver lining may be the records help raise alarm bells and persuade people to pressure political leaders to act, Otto said. “​​I hope that maybe more people will realize that this is really happening, and it’s really dangerous.”"

When your brain senses a change – either lower or higher than that – it attempts to help your body cool down or heat up, according to Dr. Judith Linden, executive vice chair of the department of emergency medicine at Boston Medical Center and a professor in the emergency medicine department at Boston University’s school of medicine. “There are a number of different ways in which (the brain) attempts to cool the body down. One way, the most common way we think of, is that you sweat,” Linden said. “The pores open, the body sweats and the sweat evaporates, that cools the body.” The second way your body cools itself down is by dilating vessels and upping your heart rate, which helps bring heat and blood to the surface of your body and helps releases that excess heat. When you’re exposed to high temperatures, it becomes harder for your body to try and keep up with cooling itself down. And if your environment is hot and humid, sweat doesn’t evaporate as easily – which pushes your body’s temperature even higher, according to the Mayo Clinic. “The higher the humidity, the lower temperatures you need for extreme heat,”  Linden said. High body temperatures can lead to damage to the brain and other vital organs, the CDC says. They can also lead to several heat-related illnesses. Mild-heat related illnesses, including heat cramps, are most common, Linden said. Heat cramps can develop in people who sweat a lot, including during exercising. The excessive sweating uses up all of the body’s salt and moisture and can lead to  muscle pains or spasms, usually in the abdomen, arms or legs, according to the CDC. A heat rash can also develop. That’s a skin irritation caused by too much sweating in hot and humid weather, and is most common in young children, the CDC says. It is usually a red cluster of pimples or blisters, and tends to be in places including the neck, upper chest or in elbow creases. When your body’s beginning to exceed its ability to cool itself down, you can develop what’s known as heat exhaustion. “In this case you’re going to see excessive sweating because your body is really going to try and keep up with that extra heat. You’re going to feel light-headed, you may feel dizzy, often people present with nausea, headaches and their skin often looks pale and clammy and their pulse is often fast,” Linden said. “This is the body’s last attempt to cool itself before it really goes into a point of no return.” A heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness, and, if left untreated, can lead to death. “That’s where your body’s temperature goes above 104 to 105 degrees or so, and this is where your mechanisms are starting to fail,” Linden said. Warning signs may include extremely high body temperatures, red and dry skin, a rapid pulse, headache, dizziness, nausea or loss of consciousness, according to the CDC. The hallmark of a heat stroke is confusion and agitation, Linden said. “So when somebody’s in the heat and they become confused and agitated, that’s heat stroke until proven otherwise and you need to call 911 for that or get help immediately and get the person out of the heat.” Elderly, people with chronic medical conditions as well as children are at higher risk for severe heat-related illnesses. The elderly and people with chronic medical conditions may be less likely to sense and respond to temperature changes and may be taking medication that make the heat effects worse, the CDC said. “Very young (people) as well, because they’re less likely to recognize heat-related illness and they’re less likely to get out of the heat if they’re starting to feel overheated,” Linden said. Student-athletes and pets are also at higher risk, she added. “In this weather, you must never, ever, ever leave a child or a pet in the car for even a minute,” Linden added. When your community is facing extreme heat, there are several things you can do to keep yourself and others safe. First, keep an eye out for symptoms of heat exhaustion or other illnesses. “If somebody starts feeling light-headed, dizzy, nausea or headache, that is the time to act immediately,” Linden said. “That means getting them out of the heat and into a cool environment.” Putting water on someone who may be experiencing symptoms and giving them fluids can help cool them down. If someone is starting to lose consciousness or has nausea or vomiting, call 911. “If you see anybody with any type of confusion, that’s an immediate red flag,” Linden added. When it’s hot outside, try to avoid outdoor activities – especially between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to Linden. If you have to go outside, wear light-colored clothing, cover your head and drink plenty of fluids. Don’t wait until you’re thirsty to drink water – as that can be a sign of dehydration. Linden recommends drinking at least one glass of water – or more – an hour. “If you do start to feel light-headed, dizzy, sweating, fast pulse, get out of the heat immediately,” Linden said. Try to find air conditioning, or places in your area where you can go to stay cool, according to Ready.gov.  Even spending a few hours in a shopping mall or public library can help. When you’re home, fans can help, but don’t rely on them as your only way of cooling down – while it may feel more comfortable, they won’t help prevent heat-related illness. “If you’re in a super hot room, if you’ve got a fan, is it helpful? No. I think, if you’ve got a fan, and you’re able to mist yourself … then fans can be helpful,” Linden said. “Fans are not foolproof.” Finally, make sure you’re checking on your neighbors, parents and friends – especially older individuals who may be living alone or are isolated, Linden said. CNN’s Rachel Ramirez contributed to this report"

",Opinion by Jay Parini,"Editor’s Note: Jay Parini, a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont. His most recent book is “Borges and Me,” a memoir. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. As much of the world now knows, Vermont is under water. The rains that swept the state in the past week have been nothing less than biblical. Massive flooding has turned our sweet capital city, Montpelier, into a lake where cars are buried, with water reaching to the second story in many buildings. The air itself tingles with fear that the Winooski River will only get worse before things improve. More than seven inches of rain fell on this poor city in a single day, and the Wrightsville Dam, just north of Montpelier, might well burst. Flooding throughout the state has affected communications, of course. Some radio towers are down. This is worse, people keep saying, than Hurricane Irene in 2011, a weather event that sticks in my own head as a terrible time for us all. “What’s different for me is that Irene lasted about 24 hours,” said Gov. Phil Scott at a news conference on Monday. “We’re getting just as much rain, if not more, and it’s going on for days. That’s my concern. It’s not just the initial damage.” Flooding has occurred in areas usually immune to such a thing, including the ski resort towns of Killington and Ludlow.  Many roads have been closed throughout the state, and emergency shelters have been set up in dozens of towns from Barre and Bethel to Jamaica and Randolph. Residents of upscale Woodstock have been told to boil their water. Late in the day on Tuesday, although the rain had stopped, the flood waters were continuing to rise. And forecasts say that more rain is likely on the way for this waterlogged region. I moved to Vermont 50 years ago, thinking it was high and dry, a place apart from the usual chaos of the world, protected from the kinds of weather events one read about in places like New Orleans or Texas or Florida. Vermont has seemed largely peaceful, a kind of rural idyll, with endless cows grazing in the fields, with rolling mountains that are, in summer, as verdant as their name, the Green Mountains. The beautiful rivers – including the Winooski, the West and the White, the Otter Creek, the Lamoille, and the Missisquoi – have been largely sedate bodies of water. They usually proceed at a stately pace and rarely go wild except, briefly, in late spring, when snowmelt adds to their volume and swiftness. I love the waterways of Vermont, and I spend a lot of time in my little boat on the Otter Creek. It’s my favorite activity: floating quietly down the river, which opens into Lake Champlain, one of the most glorious lakes in the northeastern part of the United States – a skinny body of water over 120 miles long that stretches from Canada to Whitehall, New York, where it opens into a canal that leads to the Hudson River. Several days ago, I went onto Lake Champlain on a Saturday afternoon with my wife. It would usually be crowded with sailboats, kayaks, canoes, and motorboats, a summer playground.  Eerily, we were the only boat in sight, and it was soon obvious why this was so. The air was thick with smoke from the Canadian wildfires, which made the entire northeast a danger zone. I wondered if we should just turn around and go back to the dock, but we persisted, floating in the middle of the lake as the rancid smoke, a kind of hellish smog that tore at the lungs, settled on the water. The fact that we are not separate from the effects of climate change hit me hard. It’s perhaps too easy to blame the Canadian wildfires on climate change alone. There are complicated factors at work here, as Isabella Kaminski recently noted in a piece for the BBC. But apparently half of Canadian fires are ignited by lightning strikes, and increased lightning is one of many things worsened by climate change. The climate change issue is hardly news. Human produced greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, trap the heat overhead. Overheated air magnifies the effect of evaporation. We’ve been seeing more intense weather events in Vermont for some years now. The Bible itself often speaks of fire and flood as signs of the last days. In the 17th chapter of Luke’s gospel, we read that people were eating and drinking, getting married, when the floods came “and destroyed them all.”  The gospel writer also refers to the fires of sulfur that rained down on Sodom in the time of Lot. With the biblical flooding and wildfires that seem part of life in Vermont in the summer of 2023, it’s hard not at least to feel that we too are approaching some kind of end times. Perhaps our despoiling of the planet has, at last, come home to roost."

","Betsy Klein and Jack Forrest, CNN","US climate envoy John Kerry is set to travel to Beijing this weekend for climate talks with his Chinese counterparts, a Biden administration official told CNN. The meeting comes as the US and China seek ways to work together on the climate crisis – a topic of top concern for both nations. It will mark the third visit by a US Cabinet official to the Chinese capital in a matter of weeks as Washington seeks to steer relations with Beijing back on course after months of inflamed tensions. A meeting between Kerry and his counterpart in China, Xie Zhenhua, has been months in the making, Biden’s climate czar told CNN in May. Kerry and Xie’s work together has been a relative bright spot amid an otherwise bumpy US and China relationship. “At some point, we’re going to travel over there and pick up where we left off,” Kerry said at the time. The three issues top of mind for Kerry when he spoke to CNN in May for a potential meeting in China included the country implementing its plan to cut emissions of super-polluting methane, demonstrating it can move away from coal faster and working with the US on the issue of deforestation. Last week saw the hottest global temperature ever recorded, according to data from two climate tracking agencies that covers multiple decades. And as the climate crisis intensifies, scientists are clear that record-breaking heat waves are set to become more frequent and more severe. Kerry’s planned trip comes after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrapped up meetings with China’s new economic leadership, including Premier Li Qiang and Pan Gongsheng, the newly appointed Communist Party chief of China’s central bank. Yellen in her talks with the officials urged the country to support international funds intended to help developing countries confront the climate crisis, as Beijing grappled with one of the most severe heat waves on its record. “Climate change is at the top of the list of global challenges, and the United States and China must work together to address this existential threat,” Yellen said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also traveled to Beijing in June to meet with senior Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping Yellen walked away with the message that “the world is big enough for both of our countries to thrive,” while Blinken felt the countries had “made progress and we are moving forward.” Still, even as the US looks to resume diplomatic relations with the country, it has imposed sanctions on Chinese companies, successfully pushed allies in Japan and the Netherlands to restrict sales of advanced semiconductors to China and rallied other advanced economies to counter Beijing’s “economic coercion.” This story has been updated with additional information. CNN’s Jennifer Hansler, Nectar Gan, Juliana Liu, Kylie Atwood, Simone McCarthy, Ivana Kottasová and Ella Nilsen contributed to this report."

Mann told CNN.                                             ","Angela Fritz, CNN","A “perfect storm” is unfolding this summer, one climate scientist told CNN, as atmospheric ingredients combine to create deadly flooding in the Northeast US and record-breaking heat in the Southwest US and around the world. Deadly flooding inundated parts of the Northeast, trapping people in their homes and killing at least one woman who was swept away by the fast-moving water. Rivers in Vermont rose quickly in the torrential rain on Monday to levels not seen since Hurricane Irene in 2011. On Sunday, more than 7.5 inches of rain fell at West Point, New York, in just six hours — a 1,000-year rainfall event for the area, according to a CNN analysis of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense, it only happens on average once every 1,000 years. The climate crisis is stacking the deck in favor of more intense weather events like the heavy rain and flooding in the Northeast, said Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist and distinguished professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “Sure, weather is weather. It’s going to happen — rainfall, flooding events are going to happen,” Mann told CNN. “What climate change is doing is it’s supercharging them, so when you get one of those weather systems that’s producing large amounts of rainfall, you get more rainfall.” There’s another, more surprising way that the climate crisis could be driving these extreme rainfall events, Mann said, and it’s something on the forefront of climate research: The jet stream could be getting “stuck” in positions that prolong these kinds of extreme events. The jet stream is the fast-moving river of air high in the atmosphere that ushers weather systems across the globe. Importantly, it’s fueled by the extreme difference in temperature between the equator and the poles. But the planet is not warming equally in all locations, Mann explained. The Arctic is warming much faster than the Lower 48, for example, which “reduces the temperature difference from the equator to the pole.” Scientists suspect that this decrease in temperature difference is changing how the jet stream behaves. “The jet stream basically stalls and those weather patterns remain in place — those high and low pressure centers remain in place,” Mann said. “And we’re seeing more of these sort of stuck, wavy jet stream patterns that are associated with these very persistent weather extremes, whether it’s the heat, drought, wildfire or the flooding events.” As the Northeast is inundated with flooding rain, dangerous heat is threatening other parts of the world. Temperatures are soaring in the Southwest this week, where Phoenix could break its record for consecutive number of days above 110 degrees. Last week, the planet’s average daily temperature climbed to record levels in data tracked by two climate agencies in the US and Europe. Climate scientists told CNN that the global temperatures were likely the highest in at least 100,000 years. Meanwhile, the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service found that last month was the hottest June by a “substantial margin” above the previous record, which was set in 2019. Given the exceptional heat, scientists are concerned that 2023 could be the hottest year on record. Mann said that El Niño is “adding extra heat, extra fuel to the fire.” El Niño, which is a warm phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean, is combining with the climate crisis “and what you get is new record levels of heat at the planetary scale.” But Mann said without the climate crisis, which is caused by burning fossil fuels, “we simply wouldn’t be seeing these extreme events.” “Those are conspiring. They’re combining,” Mann said. “The steady warming combined with an El Niño; extreme weather events related to those changing jet stream conditions – it all comes together, if you will, in a perfect storm of consequences, which translates to truly devastating and deadly weather extremes that we’re dealing with here right now.” CNN’s Rachel Ramirez, Laura Paddison and Jennifer Gray contributed to this story."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/12/economy/cpi-inflation-june/index.html,US inflation cooled in June for the 12th straight month,07/12/2023,                                                 What a difference a year makes.                                             ,"Alicia Wallace, CNN","What a difference a year makes. US annual inflation slowed to 3% last month, according to the latest Consumer Price Index released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s a sharp cooldown from June of last year, when surging energy costs helped inflation spike to 9.1% — the fastest annual rate since November 1981, when Olivia Newton-John’s “Physical” sweated its way to the top of the charts. Inflation, as measured by the CPI, has now eased for 12 consecutive months and is at its lowest rate since March 2021. The latest data outlines a welcome trajectory for shoppers who have seen their purchasing power and monthly budgets eroded by persistently high and pervasive price increases for the last two years. “We don’t have to worry quite as much as we were about rising prices,” William Ferguson, economics professor at Grinnell College in Iowa, told CNN. The June annual rate is down from 4% in May and landed slightly below economists’ expectations for a 3.1% increase, according to Refinitiv. On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.2%, a cooler reading than the 0.4% increase seen in May, according to the report. Gas prices picked up 1% from May but are down nearly 27% from a year ago. Food prices and grocery store prices are up 5.7% and 4.7%, respectively, for the 12 months ended in June. However, eating out remains costlier: Food away from home inflation is up 7.7% year over year, according to the report. “That’s Bidenomics in action,” President Joe Biden said Wednesday. “Today’s report brings new and encouraging evidence that inflation is falling while our economy remains strong.” While underlying inflation cooled as well — the core CPI index moderated to 4.8% for the 12 months ended in June and slowed to 0.2% monthly — the progress might not be enough to deter the Federal Reserve from raising rates when it meets later this month. “The [Federal Reserve’s] fight against inflation is working,” Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University and chief economist at SS Economics. “But that 4.8% core rate is still much too high, and the Fed has more work to do.” The Fed has a 2% target for inflation, as measured by the annual change in the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, a separate and more comprehensive gauge of price shifts. The PCE index measured 3.8% for the 12 months ended in May. Core PCE, excluding food and energy, was 4.6%. Starting in March 2022, the central bank rolled out 10 consecutive interest rate hikes to tame inflation, finally hitting pause last month. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates by another quarter point when it meets later this month. June’s CPI reading is just a touch above the 2.9% average level of inflation seen in the two decades prior to the global financial crisis, according to Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council. “The economy is defying predictions that inflation would not fall absent significant job destruction,” Brainard said Wednesday in prepared remarks at the Economic Club of New York. In June, the US economy added 209,000 jobs and the unemployment rate was 3.6%, the BLS reported last week. The monthly job gains represent a significant slowing from the breakneck pace of employment growth seen during the recovery from the pandemic; however, the current labor market is outpacing what was seen in and prior to February 2020. While wage gains have been propped up as the inflation bogeyman by some economists, Brainard has frequently expressed concern about the effects of a “price-price spiral,” when companies hike prices beyond their cost increases in order to boost profits. A recent report from the Kansas City Fed found that nearly 60% of US inflation in 2021 (the year prices really began to surge) was because of an increase in corporate profits. In previous years, corporate profits contributed to about a third of price growth. “It will be important for corporations to continue to bring their markups back down after having raised them to unusually elevated levels over the past two years, which would help in reducing inflation,” Brainard said. “The markups associated with price-price spirals — with final goods prices going up by more than input prices — should unwind if customers become more price-sensitive and firms compete more intensely for customers.” Although the stark disinflation seen in the headline rate is refreshing, the devil remains in the details. The annual CPI rate is, in part, benefiting from base effects, when comparisons are made to the prior year. And June of last year was monumental: Annual inflation soared to 9.1%, the highest in more than 40 years largely because of record-high energy costs. So the Fed and economists have been keyed in on what’s happening with core inflation, particularly core services. Since labor costs are more heavily weighted in services businesses than those who deal in goods, the tight employment market and above-average (but, until recently, below-inflation) wage gains have a greater chance of keeping higher prices sticky. Prices for services excluding energy rose just 0.3% in June, the lowest monthly uptick since September 2021. On an annual basis, that index eased to 6.2%, which is the lowest since August 2022. And that’s expected to show some further cooling in the months ahead. The shelter component of CPI, which is the largest contributor to inflation (70% in June), also is a lagging indicator of rents, which have been on the decline. Stripping out shelter, the core non-housing services index rose just 0.1% from the prior month. “Many economists argue that the last mile of inflation reduction will be the hardest, but that isn’t necessarily the case,” Julia Pollak, chief economist for ZipRecruiter, wrote in commentary issued Wednesday. “Producer prices are falling outright, inflation expectations are coming down, average weekly earnings have only risen 3.75% over the year (which is roughly consistent with 2% inflation), and aggregate labor income (the wages of all workers in the economy) is now growing more slowly than before the pandemic.” While a rate hike is practically set in stone, this report, plus other economic data and the fact that monetary policy works on its own lag — anywhere from six months to two years — should instead force the Fed to keep its finger on the pause button, Sohn said. “They’ve done enough,” he said. “They’re making good progress, so let’s wait and see. We don’t need any more hikes now.” — CNN’s Nicole Goodkind contributed to this report."

","Christina Maxouris, CNN","Arizonans have endured scorching temperatures for more than two weeks and that hot streak is about to get even hotter, with a brutal heat wave starting to take shape ahead of the weekend. Temperatures in Phoenix have reached 110 degrees Fahrenheit every single day this month. On Wednesday, the city’s high was 111 degrees, making it the third longest streak in history during which Phoenix recorded continuous temperatures of at least 110 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. The longest streak, set in 1974, was 18 days. Meteorologists expect the weekend heat will be record-breaking, reaching a staggering 119 degrees in some parts. “The Southwest often has the hottest temperatures in the country during the summer months, but this is not your typical summer heat wave,” CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward said. “Over the coming days many locations will experience some of the top 10 temperatures they have ever recorded. “This type of heat has to be taken seriously as heat stress can occur very quickly for those out in the elements.” The dangerous temperatures track with the rest of the world’s soaring climate records amid a crisis that’s heating up the planet fast. Scientists have warned there’s a growing likelihood that 2023 could be the Earth’s hottest year on record. Over the next week, nearly 70% of all Americans will see a high temperature at or above 90 degrees, while more than 55 million people will see temperatures at or above 100 degrees. In Arizona, an excessive heat warning is in effect through much of the state, including Maricopa County, home to the state’s capital city. And the oppressive heat there won’t just get worse – it’ll expand, reaching further west into California and Nevada with several locations in the region expected to tie or break their all-time high temperature records by the weekend, according to the Weather Prediction Center. “Dangerous heat is coming,” the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said Tuesday. “Temperatures later this week may challenge daily and all-time records, with little-to-no overnight relief.” Further east, in parts of the Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley and the Southeast – which have also been searing in high temperatures – the heat and humidity will make it feel warmer than 115 degrees this week, the prediction center said. “It is imperative,” the prediction center warned, that people take action “to limit their exposure to the oppressive hot weather as it looks to stick around for the time being.” In Arizona’s Yavapai County, authorities found a “severely dehydrated” Buddhist monk who went missing Saturday evening after not returning from a walk, according to a Facebook post from the sheriff’s office. The monk was located the next day about 20 to 25 miles from the temple he had started his walk from and was checked by medical professionals who found he was dehydrated, the sheriff’s office said. The state’s Department of Public Safety has urged Arizona residents to ensure they’ve stocked their cars with water, sun protection and have with them charged phones and plenty of gas, amid the dangerous heat. CNN’s Sara Smart contributed to this report."

","Eric Zerkel, CNN","A sudden marine heat wave off the coast of Florida has surprised scientists and sent water temperatures soaring to unprecedented highs, threatening one of the most severe coral bleaching events the state has ever seen. Sea surface temperatures around Florida have reached the highest levels on record since satellites began collecting ocean data. And the warming is happening much earlier than normal – yet another example of ocean heat being amplified by the human-caused climate crisis and the extreme weather it brings. “We didn’t expect this heating to happen so early in the year and to be so extreme,” Derek Manzello, a coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch, told CNN. “This appears to be unprecedented in our records.” The exceptional temperatures – close to 97 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas – are more than just another alarming climate record; extreme ocean heat and its duration are critical in deciding the survival of coral reefs. Temperatures that are too hot for too long cause coral to bleach, turning a ghastly white as they expel their algal food source and slowly starve to death. Coral that bleaches won’t always die, but the more intense the heat and the longer it lasts, the more inevitable death becomes, coral experts said. All it takes is sea surface warming of 1 degree Celsius, or 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit, beyond the reef’s normal highest temperature to trigger the heat stress that leads to bleaching, according to Manzello. The sea surface temperatures around Florida are more than 2 degrees Celsius above that normal range and have been for one to two weeks, he said. Buoys off the coast of Florida measured hot tub-like water temperatures near 97 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday in the shallow, heat-prone Florida Bay between the southern tip of Florida and the Keys. The more ecologically vital and expansive coral reefs are located east and south of the Florida Keys, but the buoy measurements indicate just how extreme the heat in Florida has been so unusually early in the summer. Ocean temperatures around Florida usually get hotter as the summer progresses and don’t reach their peak until late August into September, Manzello said, meaning ocean temperatures could rise further. That would mean “significant and severe” bleaching will start in the next week and the coral could start to die altogether within a month, he said. “It still remains to be seen if this event is going to be more or less severe than previous events,” Manzello said. “However, all of the evidence right now is pointing to the fact that it’s going to be one of the more severe events we’ve seen.” The bleaching is already happening in the Florida Keys, which is home to 6,000 individual reefs. Eleven observations of partial bleaching were confirmed by the Mote Marine Laboratory in June. Experts said they expected that number to grow exponentially in the weeks to come. Katey Lesneski saw bleaching firsthand this past weekend while diving at an unnamed reef off the coast of Islamorada, one of the northern Florida Keys. Lesneki is the monitoring coordinator for Mission: Iconic Reefs, a NOAA project that aims to restore seven “iconic” reefs around the Florida Keys to some of their former glory over the next 20 years by planting and growing coral there. She said she saw the beginning stages of bleaching happening in coral up to 60 feet deep. “The corals look a lot lighter in color, they’re usually pretty robust tones of yellows and greens and browns and oranges, but they literally start to look like someone threw bleach on them,” Lesneski told CNN. A NOAA study published last year found that climate change-fueled coral disease and bleaching had already eroded 70% of Florida’s coral reefs. The seven reefs that Lesneski is trying to restore went from well over 50% coral cover, to just 2% coral cover by the time her program launched in 2019. Florida is losing more than just the coral. Coral reefs generate billions of dollars for Florida’s economy through activities like fishing and tourism, which wouldn’t be possible without reefs to protect the species that rely on them. “Just from an ecological standpoint, about 25% of the marine species depend on coral reefs at some point in their lives,” Lesneski said. “That’s everything from the pretty fish that people like to look at to the large game fish … those fish get their start and heavily depend on other components of the reef at some point in time.” Florida’s latest coral crisis is just another symptom of the broader threat of climate change, which could wipe out all of Earth’s coral reefs by 2100, a recent study found. “What we’re looking at right now is another cut in a death by a thousand cuts,” Manzello said. “Ocean warming is only getting worse, bleaching events are getting more frequent, so it’s really an existential crisis for coral reefs as we know them.”"

","Jack Guy, CNN","The color of the ocean has changed significantly over the last 20 years and human-caused climate change is likely responsible, according to a new study. More than 56% of the world’s oceans have changed color to an extent that cannot be explained by natural variability, said a team of researchers, led by scientists from the National Oceanography Center in the UK and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, in a statement. Tropical oceans close to the equator in particular have become greener in the past two decades, reflecting changes in their ecosystems, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. The color of the ocean is derived from the materials found in its upper layers. For example, a deep blue sea will have very little life in it, whereas a green color means there are ecosystems there, based on phytoplankton, plant-like microbes which contain chlorophyll. The phytoplankton form the basis of a food web which supports larger organisms such as krill, fish, seabirds and marine mammals. It’s not clear exactly how these ecosystems are changing, said study co-author Stephanie Dutkiewicz, senior research scientist in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and the Center for Global Change Science. While some areas are likely to have less phytoplankton, others will have more – and it’s likely all parts of the ocean will see changes in the types of phytoplankton present. Ocean ecosystems are finely balanced and any change in the phytoplankton will send ripples across the food chain. “All changes are causing an imbalance in the natural organization of ecosystems. Such imbalance will only get worse over time if our oceans keep heating,” she told CNN. It will also affect the ocean’s ability to act as a store of carbon, Dutkiewicz said, as different plankton absorb different amounts of carbon. While the researchers are still working to unpick exactly what the changes mean, what is clear, they said, is that the changes are being driven by human-induced climate change. The researchers monitored changes in ocean color from space by tracking how much green or blue light is reflected from the surface of the sea. They used data from the Aqua satellite which has been monitoring ocean color changes for more than two decades and is able to pick out differences that are not visible to the human eye. They analyzed color variation data from 2002 to 2022 and then used climate change models to simulate what would happen to the oceans both with additional planet-heating pollution and without. The color changes matched almost exactly what Dutkiewicz predicted would happen if greenhouse gases were added to the atmosphere – that around 50% of our oceans would change color. Dutkiewicz, who has been running simulations that showed the oceans were going to change color for years, said she is not surprised at this finding. “But still I found the results very sobering; yet another wake-up call that human induced climate change [has] significantly impacted the earth system,” she told CNN via email. Dutkiewicz told CNN it was difficult to say whether color changes could become visible to humans if the process continues. “If a big tipping point was reached in some places: maybe. Though you’d have to study the colors for a while to be able to pick up on the changes,” said Dutkiewicz. Next up, Dutkiewicz will try to better understand the color changes in different ocean regions, as well as looking into what might be causing them, she said."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","Tucked into President Joe Biden’s ambitious, sweeping climate commitments is a crucially important goal that dates back to his campaign: Transforming the US electric grid to run entirely on clean energy by 2035. The goal could make or break Biden’s pledge to slash the country’s planet-warming emissions in half by 2030. And if successful, 100% clean electricity could energize vast sectors of the US economy: electric vehicles, home and office heating and cooling, and appliances. It could even power heavy industry and manufacturing, which is currently reliant on fossil fuels. “When you have a fully clean grid, versus a grid that either is a quarter or a half clean, that makes a significant difference in terms of the greenhouse gas performance of the things you’re plugging in to that grid,” White House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi told CNN. “That electric vehicle now is twice or three times cleaner when you shift to a fully clean grid.” Yet while renewable energy has exploded over the past decade, bringing Biden’s cornerstone climate goal to fruition by 2035 could be beyond his grasp. As of this year, about 44% of America’s electricity was powered by zero-emissions sources like wind, solar, nuclear and hydropower, according to the Department of Energy. The rest comes from fossil fuels like methane gas and coal. After the Inflation Reduction Act passed last year – legislation that aimed to supercharge clean energy in the US – an analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory predicts the US will get to around 80% clean electricity by 2030, a number that includes renewables, nuclear energy and carbon capture on fossil fuel plants. By 2035, the federal analysis shows clean and renewable sources will make up about 86% of US energy, spurred in large part by the IRA. (That analysis did not include the Biden administration’s proposed pollution rules for power plants, which could increase the adoption of clean energy.) “That’s a doubling from today, which is huge,” Ben King, an associate director at the nonpartisan think tank Rhodium Group, told CNN. But it’s also short of Biden’s goal of 100% clean electricity by that date. Decarbonizing the last portion of the power sector will be the most difficult, federal officials and experts told CNN. The closer you get to 100% percent clean electricity, the harder it is to go all the way. “We’ve known that the last 10% – maybe the last 20 to 25% – is going to be challenging,” Zaidi said. “And the reason is because you’re not just trying to deliver clean electrons onto the grid. You’re trying to deliver cleaner electrons when you want them, where you want them. That’s a hard thing to do.” Not only does the power need to come from clean sources, it also needs to be readily available to energize the US economy during peak demand. But wind and solar are still variable – especially without massive, costly battery storage. And newer technologies, like green hydrogen, carbon capture and small modular nuclear reactors haven’t yet been built to a large enough scale. That could mean some fossil fuels plants outfitted with carbon capture would need to remain connected to the grid to provide power that can brought online quickly, King said. There are also big infrastructure hurdles for renewables to take the lead. Even if massive amounts of wind and solar are developed by the end of this decade, the US may not have enough electrical transmission infrastructure to move all of that renewable energy around the grid. “The bottlenecks of a lack of transmission are very real,” Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, told CNN. There also needs to be significant investment in massive batteries to store the power generated by wind and solar to be used at all hours, she said. While companies and the federal government are racing to scale up new zero-carbon technologies, traditional wind and solar will largely power this clean electricity transition. They are the most reliable and trusted clean energy sources for utilities and developers, and they have quickly become cheaper than fossil fuels – so inexpensive that it is becoming more cost-effective for some utilities to build new wind and solar, rather than constructing new fossil plants or even running existing ones, experts told CNN. Wind and solar are also mature technologies that developers know they can finance and get huge tax breaks on through the Inflation Reduction Act. They are the “natural choice for developers who are looking for those low risk and very cost-effective projects to develop,” Sonia Aggarwal, a former White House senior advisor for climate policy and CEO of nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, told CNN. “We will see them play a large role because of how good they look from an economic perspective.” By the end of 2021, wind and solar together made up about 228 gigawatts of power. By 2034, NREL predicts that number – including offshore wind – will grow by more than four times to over 1 terawatt, or 1 trillion watts of power. “Where we are now is very different from even 5 or 10 years ago as far as the costs of clean energy, particularly renewables, being significantly lower than they’ve been in the past,” Carla Frisch, acting executive director of the US Energy Department’s Office of Policy, told CNN. “So just a really rapid acceleration that we’re already experiencing right now.” While getting new clean technologies to scale will be difficult, it’s work worth doing, Zaidi said. “Let’s deploy the stuff we have right now, right away,” he said. “And let’s work hard as we can to innovate on the stuff that we need in the future.”"

Here’s what that means for air quality headed into the weekend.                                             ","by Eric Zerkel, CNN","A recent outbreak of wildfires in western Canada is again sending a plume of unhealthy smoke into the United States. Air quality alerts were in effect Saturday for at least eight states across the northern Plains and upper Midwest as smoke from the wildfires returns. Smoke will be heaviest across parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota and Iowa on Saturday before shifting southeastward later in the weekend. Minneapolis and Des Moines, Iowa, will see the worst of the smoke Saturday while cities such as Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, and Cincinnati will begin to see the effects on Sunday. The Midwest will continue to see poor air quality and decreased visibility into early next week as the smoke lingers. Chicago experienced some of the worst air quality in the world amid heavy smoke in late-June. This time, the smoke plume is not coming from the Canadian province of Quebec. It is instead funneling across Canada from much further away in the West, so it shouldn’t reach the Northeast like it did in early June, when New York City’s skies turned an apocalyptic shade of orange. On Friday, the encroaching smoke dropped air quality in parts of Montana and North Dakota to code red, or unhealthy levels on the Air Quality Index, and to code orange, or unhealthy for sensitive groups, in Minnesota, according to airnow.gov. Wildfire smoke contains tiny pollutants known as particle matter, or PM 2.5, that can get into the lungs and bloodstream once inhaled. These pollutants most commonly cause difficulty breathing and eye and throat irritation, but have also been linked to more serious long-term health issues like lung cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The plume was birthed from nearly 400 fires sparked in Canada’s province of British Columbia in the past week, nearly half of which were started by 51,000 lightning strikes from thunderstorms, the BC Wildfire Service said. Some of those thunderstorms were “dry” or produced inconsequential amounts of rain to help squelch any fires, a dangerous prospect in a province experiencing the worst level of drought. Parts of the US will be at risk of smoke for the foreseeable future depending on weather patterns and fire flareups because Canada is experiencing its worst fire season on record. More than 24 million acres have burned so far this year, an area roughly the size of Indiana. British Columbia has had more than 1,000 fires start since April. Those fires have already burned through nearly three times the amount of land compared to an average year in British Columbia over the last 10 years, the BC Wildfire Service said. One firefighter died Thursday responding to one of the blazes near Revelstoke, British Columbia, a press release from the firefighter’s union said. The BC Wildfire Service confirmed the death to CNN. The firefighter has not been identified. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau eulogized the firefighter on Twitter Friday. “The news from British Columbia – that one of the firefighters bravely battling wildfires has lost her life – is heartbreaking,” Trudeau said. “At this incredibly difficult time, I’m sending my deepest condolences to her family, her friends, and her fellow firefighters.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/14/weather/heat-wave-phoenix-california-las-vegas-climate/index.html,A weekslong heat wave will intensify this weekend and push temperatures close to 130 degrees,07-15-2023,                                                 An already dangerous weekslong heat wave will only worsen this weekend as a heat dome intensifies and reaches peak strength over parts of the Western United States.                                             ,"Eric Zerkel, CNN","An already dangerous weekslong heat wave will only worsen this weekend as a heat dome intensifies and reaches peak strength over parts of the Western United States. The heat dome is so formidable the National Weather Service in Phoenix called it “one of the strongest high pressure systems this region has ever seen.” Around 100 heat records could fall today through the weekend as it intensifies, piling onto the more than 1,000 high temperature records broken in the US since June. More than 90 million people are under heat alerts after the heat dome expanded into places like California, which is now experiencing its first extreme heat wave of the year. It has already been dangerously hot for weeks in Texas, Florida and Arizona, where Phoenix is in the middle of a likely record-breaking streak of consecutive 110-degree days, forcing many businesses and parks to close or readjust their hours. The low temperature in Phoenix might not drop below 90 degrees for eight consecutive days, another record. The heat will be so intense, forecasters suggested residents of Las Vegas avoid the outdoors between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., with the city forecast to challenge its all-time high temperature of 117 degrees on Sunday. It won’t get much cooler at night, with low temperatures nearing 90 degrees – a particularly dangerous side effect of the climate crisis. Even the hottest place on Earth, California’s Death Valley, could reach rare highs, with 130 degrees possible Sunday, forecasters at the National Weather Service told CNN. It has only happened a handful of times, one of which is the all-time global record high temperature of 134 degrees. In turn, Death Valley National Park in California and Saguaro National Park in Arizona posted warnings on their websites advising people not hike after 10 a.m. local time. Officials at New Mexico’s White Sands National Park cautioned,”High temperatures over 100F degrees are expected. We strongly recommend to not start a hike if the temperature is over 85F degrees.” Also, Texas authorities at Big Bend National Park said temperatures top 110 degrees daily along the Rio Grande river and throughout the desert areas. “These are extremely dangerous/deadly temperatures! Hikers should be OFF TRAILS in the afternoon. Stay hydrated. Limit your exposure,” the park said on its website. This kind of extreme heat is one of the hallmarks of human-caused climate change, the symptoms of which are tallying up this year into a global record box score of sorts: “unprecedented” ocean heat off the coast of Florida and in the North Atlantic; record heat in Beijing, in what could be one of the hottest summers in China; record energy demand and heat in Texas; and an ongoing “Cerberus” heat wave, threatening to topple European temperature records. It all adds up to what could be the hottest year on record. Skyrocketing temperatures across the western US have forced some businesses and parks to close or change their hours, such as the Sacramento Zoo, which shortened its hours due to the heat, closing early Friday, Saturday and Sunday at 1 p.m. PT as temperatures are forecast to reach 109 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend. In Bakersfield, California, where the highest temperature this weekend is set to reach 114 degrees Fahrenheit, the Kern County Museum announced it would be closed “due to extreme heat” this weekend, according to a museum social media post. In Southern California, the Cleveland National Forest announced on its Facebook page that four of its trails – the San Diego River Gorge, Cedar Creek Falls, Three Sisters Falls and Eagle Peak – will be closed through the weekend due to “excessive heat.” Other businesses in California, such as the California Gray’s Flower Garden in Quincy and the Nascere Vineyards in Chico announced plans to close their doors over the weekend as temperatures are expected to reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The Bison Café in Quitaque, Texas said it was limiting its hours due to higher temperatures that are making the kitchen “very uncomfortable” for cooks. Separately, in Phoenix, the Arizona Animal Welfare League decided to close its doors for the weekend. “The safety of our pets is our top priority and with temperatures expected to hit over 115, our staff’s main focus will be on keeping our animals cool and comfortable during this time,” a Facebook post from the organization reads. The records also add up into something more serious for human health, doctors say. “Make no mistake about it: This heat is deadly, and being in it for long periods of time is deadly,” Dr. Matthew Levy of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine told CNN. The extreme temperatures could trigger heat illness in as little as 20 to 30 minutes for people doing anything strenuous outdoors, because heat acts as a “perfect storm,” which overloads the body until it eventually short-circuits and then shuts down, Levy said. The time frame would be even shorter for those most vulnerable to heat, like the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions. Heat illness is a serious concern this weekend for the millions of residents in major metro areas like Phoenix and Las Vegas. People across the Southwest and California’s Central Valley are under a rare “extreme” level of heat risk on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, according to the weather service. The “extreme HeatRisk” is the highest possible risk level for heat, akin to a “high risk” for tornadoes, and is meant to warn of significant heat impacts requiring preparation. These areas should prepare for spikes in heat-related ER visits, potential power outages from demand and temperatures high enough to turn deadly, especially for outdoor workers and those without reliable cooling. Levy said workers can stay safe by taking frequent hydration breaks, wearing clothing able to reflect the sun and having a “buddy system” so no one is left in the heat alone when illness strikes. For those who don’t have reliable cooling, he recommends finding a cooling center and having a plan to get there before the need arises. Before the latest wave, heat has already killed at least 12 people in Phoenix’s Maricopa County this year, and killed 425 people last year. The city has opened “respite centers” to help provide relief and the state has asked residents to keep their vehicles stocked with water. The heat won’t go away after this weekend, even if temperatures peak: Longer term temperature outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center point to above normal temperatures across Southern California, the Southwest, South and Florida through next week. CNN’s Dave Alsup contributed to this report."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/14/weather/what-is-el-nino-xpn/index.html,What is El Niño?,07-14-2023,                                                 El Niño is a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and impacts weather all over the world.                                             ,"Brandon Miller, Nick Thompson and Jennifer Gray, CNN","El Niño is a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and impacts weather all over the world. Warm water normally is confined to the western Pacific by winds that blow from east to west, pushing it toward Indonesia and Australia. But during an El Niño, the winds slow down and can even reverse direction, allowing the warmer water to spread eastward all the way to South America. Scientists are still searching for an answer as to why this happens, but the slowing of these winds can last for weeks or months. El Niños – among many large-scale weather patterns that act in tandem to influence global weather – occur every two to seven years in varying intensity, and the waters of the eastern Pacific can be up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) warmer than usual. El Niño, which in Spanish means “little boy,” is the opposite of the La Niña, or “little girl,” climate pattern. A strong El Niño heats up the atmosphere and changes circulation patterns around the globe. It can especially affect the jet stream – a narrow band of strong wind in the upper atmosphere – over the Pacific, which gets stronger and dumps more frequent and intense storms over the western US, especially California, and along South America’s west coast. The atmosphere, however, is something of a zero-sum game: More rain in North and South America falls at the expense of normally rainy southern Asia and Australia, which in turn can experience droughts. El Niño has been known to cause intense flooding across eastern sections of Africa – leading to landslides, an increase in waterborne diseases and even food shortages – while northern and southern parts of the continent experience severe drought. A strong El Niño also influences cyclone seasons around the planet. The warmer the Pacific is, the more hurricanes or typhoons it gets – while fewer hurricanes form in Atlantic Ocean because increased upper-level winds prevent them from developing. This happened during the 2015 hurricane season, with the Pacific breaking records while the Atlantic seeing a relatively quiet year. Like snowflakes, no two El Niños are exactly alike. For instance, an area of warmer water in the northern Pacific that became known as “the blob” during the 2014-2016 El Niño event wasn’t there during the 1997 El Niño. But during typical El Niño years, more rain falls in the southwestern and southeastern United States, while the North experiences much drier and warmer weather. And weather isn’t the only thing El Niño affects. Warmer surface waters in the eastern Pacific drive away cold-water fish that are the backbone of the fishing industry in much of Latin America. In fact, fishermen there first noticed the phenomenon and named it “little boy” or “Christ child” in Spanish, since it often appeared around Christmas. The influence of the climate crisis on El Niño is still a matter of debate. Climate change could make El Niños’ impact worse, some recent studies show. And while the overall number of El Niños is unlikely to increase as the planet warms, amplified, so-called “super” El Niños will be twice as likely, other research suggests. Among the most likely byproducts of global warming are more extreme precipitation events because warmer temperatures can hold more water vapor in the atmosphere. That could make El Niño-induced floods even more devastating."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/14/world/scientists-are-growing-seeds-in-space-climate-change-scn-spc/index.html,Scientists are growing seeds in space to help adapt to climate change on Earth,07-14-2023,                                                 Researchers from the joint laboratories of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Food and Agriculture Organization sent seeds to the International Space Station to produce plants with genetic mutations.                                             ,"Nadia Leigh-Hewitson, CNN","Plants naturally adapt to grow in challenging environments. Spontaneous natural mutations produce new traits, such as drought tolerance and disease resistance, which can help the plant to thrive. But the Earth’s climate is changing faster than plants can naturally evolve, meaning that many of the plants we rely on for food are under threat. Agriculture is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of changing climate conditions and although changes to temperature, rainfall patterns, and frost might extend a growing season or enable the cultivation of different crops, climate change also introduces major challenges for farming. Now, scientists are turning to the vastness of space for solutions. In 2022, the joint laboratories of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) sent seeds on a trip to the International Space Station (ISS). The objective: to induce genetic mutations in the seeds through exposure to cosmic radiation and microgravity, that could help develop resilient crops capable of thriving in the face of the escalating climate crisis. Seeds of a cereal grain called sorghum, and a type of cress called Arabidopsis, spent several months on the ISS before they were returned to Earth this April for analysis. Now screening will begin to identify favorable traits in the mutated seeds. Shoba Sivasankar, head of Plant Breeding and Genetics for the joint FAO and IAEA Center of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, explains that scientists are able to artificially induce plant mutations on Earth using gamma rays and X-rays. However, the space environment, which offers a broader spectrum of radiation and additional extremes like microgravity and temperature fluctuations, has the potential to induce genetic alterations that differ from, or are induced much quicker than, those typically observed using terrestrial radiation sources. “In space, the stress that will be encountered by an organism would be at the highest level and beyond anything that we can actually simulate on Earth,” explains Sivasankar. She adds that the radiation outside the ISS could be “more than a hundredfold higher” than the natural radiation possible on Earth. By selectively breeding plants grown from the mutated seeds, Sivasankar and her team hope to create new crop strains. “Firstly, we are working on improving crop yields and productivity of crops such as grains, legumes, roots and tubers – for example, cassava and sweet potato,” she says. “And then there is climate change resilience – for example resistance to increasing incidence of diseases, tolerance of climate phenomenon such as drought, or high heat, and increasing salinity of the soil because of saltwater intrusion or irrigation and evaporation.” For decades scientists have been sending seeds to space. China has been using space radiation to induce genetic mutation in crops since the 1980s, exposing seeds to cosmic radiation via satellites and high-altitude balloons, which reportedly facilitated the production of giant sweet peppers and improvements in wheat and rice. Many different varieties of seed have been aboard the International Space Station, while researchers at Michigan State University (MSU) are currently experimenting with the cultivation of seeds that were sent on a journey around the moon as part of NASA’s Artemis program. The MSU scientists are exploring the effect of extraterrestrial conditions on plant amino acids – the building block of proteins – and evaluating how that impacts plant growth and development. The research could offer insights into the adaptive capabilities of plants in extreme environments, and help us understand how crops could potentially be grown off-Earth for long-duration space missions. The private sector has also taken an interest in the impact of spaceflight on plant seeds. In the United Arab Emirates, StarLab Oasis, an Abu Dhabi-based startup, has announced plans to send quinoa seeds into space in the hopes of enhancing the genetic potential of a crop that holds promise for its nutritional value and adaptability in arid regions. Sending seeds to space will help “sustainability, climate change, and food security on Earth,” StarLab Oasis’ co-founder Allen Herbert told CNN in 2022. “Space is a place where you have limited resources, limited energy, limited space. It’s the perfect place to do research and that same technology can be brought right back down to Earth.” It’s that same hope of finding solutions for Earthbound agriculture that’s driving Sivasankar, and the IAEA says initial results from its research could be available later this year. “I do feel hopeful for the future of food security, because technology is coming to the fore,” she says. “But food security is not just about genetics – we need a combination of all technologies, and everybody needs to come together and work together.”"

","Analysis by Nectar Gan, CNN","As John Kerry arrived in Beijing Sunday for a long-awaited trip to restart climate negotiations, the US climate envoy stepped off the plane into one of the hottest summers ever recorded in the Chinese capital. Since 1951, Beijing has seen temperatures breaching 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) on 11 days — with almost half of them occurring in the past few weeks, including a new record for the city’s hottest day in June. In the United States, an extreme heat wave is also swelling, with temperatures in the Southwest soaring as high as 120°F (49°C). It’s a global problem: the planet’s hottest day ever was recorded for four straight days earlier this month. “If anything, this is the situation that should most bring China and the US back on the same page,” said Li Shuo, senior global policy adviser at Greenpeace China. “Regardless of their political differences, the impacts of climate change have now become a common experience for both countries — it’s no longer a hypothetical crisis or analytical challenge, but a living reality that can be felt through the skin.” As the world’s two biggest polluters — with China’s emissions of planet-heating pollution more than double those of the US — the two countries account for nearly 40% of global emissions. This means attempts to stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis will need to involve these two powerhouse nations drastically cutting fossil fuel production — yet climate cooperation between them has been largely frozen for nearly a year amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Last August, Beijing cut off climate talks with Washington in protest at then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan — in the middle of the worst heat wave China had seen in six decades. More than two months of scorching heat dried up reservoirs, killed crops and livestock, crippled power supplies and led to rolling blackouts in some of the largest and most prosperous Chinese metropolises. This year, sweltering temperatures have arrived even earlier, impacting hundreds of millions of residents and again putting huge strains on the country’s electricity grid. China Energy Investment Corporation, the world’s largest generator of coal-fired power, said its production of electricity reached a historic high on Monday. The unrelenting heat waves highlight the urgency for the US and China to resume cooperation, as the unfolding climate crisis will not wait for the two countries to fix their relations first, experts say. “The suspension of climate talks set a very bad precedent,” Li said. “Tensions in bilateral relations shouldn’t stand in the way of climate discussions. There needs to be more resilience.” Kerry is the third US cabinet member to visit China in recent weeks, as the Biden administration steps up efforts to mend fractured communications and stabilize tense relations with Beijing. Last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with China’s Premier Li Qiang last week. On Thursday, Blinken met with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines of a summit in Jakarta. “In the wake of Covid and ever-worsening US-China relations, climate change promises to be an area where productive collaboration can benefit our two countries and the rest of the world,” said Alex Wang, a professor of Law at the University of California, Los Angeles and an expert on Chinese climate policy. “Each country now has major programs in place to invest in and promote decarbonization, but neither side is moving quickly enough,” he added. Kerry, 79, has traveled to China twice since being appointed as US President Joe Biden’s special climate envoy. He visited Shanghai in April 2021 and Tianjin five months later, amid China’s rigid zero-Covid restrictions. This time, Kerry will spend four days in Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials. “Secretary Kerry aims to engage with the PRC on addressing the climate crisis, including with respect to increasing implementation and ambition and promoting a successful COP28,” the US State Department said in a statement Wednesday, referring to China by its formal title, the People’s Republic of China. China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment said the two sides will have an “in-depth exchange of views on cooperation to address climate change.” Like the visits by Blinken and Yellen, experts don’t expect any major announcements from Kerry’s trip, but they say the optics are significant. Li, the Greenpeace analyst, said he would be closely watching who will meet with Kerry in Beijing. The default lineup, he said, includes Kerry’s Chinese counterpart Xie zhenhua, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang and a vice minister of ecology and environment. If Kerry was granted an audience with Chinese leader Xi, it would send an important signal on Beijing’s commitment for future engagement, Li said. Kerry has previously met with Xi in Beijing and Washington as then-Secretary of state during the Obama administration. He has also worked closely with Xie, China’s special climate envoy, on a groundbreaking US-China climate deal that paved the way for the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The pair also inked the US-China Glasgow joint declaration at the COP26 climate summit in 2021. Kerry told CNN in a recent interview that US officials were planning to press China on commitments to cut back on burning coal and to slash its emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. “What we’re trying to achieve now is really to establish some stability, if we can in the relationship, without conceding anything,” Kerry said. “I’m not going over with any concessions.” Beijing, meanwhile, is likely to ask Washington to remove tariffs on Chinese solar panels, according to Li. “But chances of breakthroughs are slim because these issues are highly political,” he said. A more realistic goal, according to Li, would be for the two sides to resume their joint working group on climate cooperation and pledge to continue communication before COP28 in Dubai, which begins November 30. Both sides face pressure from their own domestic politics to walk a tightrope. On Thursday, Republicans grilled Kerry in front of a House panel, attacking him for not doing enough to push China to cut emissions. Some criticized him for even engaging in climate negotiations with China, citing its human rights records and strategic rivalry with the US. Kerry defended his trip, arguing it would be “malpractice of the worst order, diplomatic and political and common sense” for the US not to talk to China. “What we’re trying to do is find ways we can cooperate to actually address the crisis, because China as the world’s second largest economy and as the world’s largest emitter is critical to our being able to solve this problem,” he said. Wang, the expert at UCLA, said the speed of China’s transition from coal would be a major topic of conversation for Kerry. “It’s almost the number one question that any outsider will have of Chinese officials,” he said. “It’s important because it’s such an enormous source of emissions and if China doesn’t resolve it, all of their success on electric vehicles will not be as meaningful because you’re just using electricity generated from coal.” Xi has pledged that China will reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060. That would require the country to phase out coal power, which accounts for about 60% of its total electricity generation. To achieve that goal, China has massively ramped up installation of clean energy. Its solar capacity is now greater than the rest of the world combined, and its wind capacity is roughly equal to the combined total of the other top seven countries, according to a study from the non-profit Global Energy Monitor. But at the same time, China has also been building a large number of new coal-fired power plants due to renewed concerns over energy security following months of power shortages in 2021 and 2022. To many local governments, coal is still seen as the easiest and cheapest solution to power disruptions. “The idea of security and the idea of having sufficient backup for renewable energy are all part of the story of why coal is still being relied on to the degree that it is,” Wang said. In the first quarter of this year, provincial governments approved more new coal-fired electricity generation than they did in all of 2021, according a study of official documents by Greenpeace. “The expansion of coal is a grave challenge for China’s climate policy,” Li said. “If coal consumption does not decrease in proportion and in absolute amount, it will be very difficult for China to achieve long-term and meaningful emission reductions.” CNN’s Helen Regan and Ella Nilsen contributed reporting."

That’s happened just five times in more than 110 years of record Phoenix temperatures have reached 110 degrees on consecutive days, and the streak should continue through at least Wednesday. In Southern California, the Riverside County Fire Department is battling three wildfires that started Friday, including the Rabbit Fire. It grew from 20 acres to 4,500 acres and was 5% contained Saturday, Cal Fire said. Meanwhile, sultry conditions will persist in the south-central US and in South Florida. Daytime highs in the 90s to low 100s with oppressive humidity levels will allow heat indices to range frequently between 105-110F each afternoon. A heat advisory is in place from Texas to Alabama but does not include Georgia or most of Florida. The high in Houston is forecast for 100 degrees on Saturday. It could reach 96 in New Orleans and Jackson, Mississippi. Atlanta is expected to reach only a relatively mild 92. And wildfire smoke from Canada will move into the Northern Plains and Midwest over the weekend and into early next week. Concern about power outages from increased demand arose in the Southwest. And some venues planned to close early or cancel events, including the Sacramanto (California) Zoo and the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix. Alerts for dangerous heat levels have been posted in areas of Arizona and Texas for more than 30 days in a row as a long-lasting heat wave has settled over parts of the West and South since mid-June. Temperatures have failed to drop below 90 in the Phoenix area since Monday, a trend that could be deadly for those without air conditioning if they are unable to cool and recover their bodies overnight. In Texas, El Paso broke its own high temperature streak record on Thursday after experiencing 28 consecutive days above 100 degrees, the weather service tweeted. That streak will likely extend well beyond 30 days as El Paso is expected to see temperatures of at least 103 degrees through the middle of next week. Elsewhere, much of Texas’ eastern half saw heat indices – what the combined humidity and temperature feels like – between 110 and 115 degrees on Thursday. Widespread temperatures of 100 to 108 were seen across much of the state Thursday, including temperatures of 107 in Austin and Del Rio. The North Texas city of Wichita Falls broke a daily record of 110 degrees with a heat index as high as 118 degrees. As the climate crisis ratchets temperatures higher and higher, scientists have warned there’s a growing likelihood that 2023 could be the Earth’s hottest year on record. Heat kills more Americans than any other form of severe weather, including flooding, hurricanes or extreme cold, according to National Weather Service data. Communities across the globe are already feeling the devastation of these extreme temperatures, including one Texas county that reported at least 11 heat-related deaths during last month’s heat wave. In Mexico, at least 112 people have died from extreme heat exposure since March. While our bodies try to regulate their own temperature, extreme heat can make it hard for the body to cool down, and added humidity can make that struggle even worse. When the body becomes unable to cool itself, illnesses such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke – which can be fatal – can set in. The risks of heat exposure are particularly high for people experiencing homelessness, outdoor workers, low-income families, communities of color and the elderly. To stay safe in sweltering temperatures, experts recommend hydrating regularly, finding a cool or air-conditioned place and avoiding outside activities, particularly during the hottest times of the day. People should watch for signs of heat exhaustion or other illnesses, which include light-headedness, nausea, headache or confusion. CNN’s Jay Croft, Taylor Ward, Elizabeth Wolfe and Christina Maxouris contributed to this report."

These natural features may not be that exciting to look at for some of us, but for geologists they bristle with meaning. The story they tell is our planet’s history, chronicling how continents, mountain ranges and oceans formed and glaciers spread and receded. Fossils embedded in rock reveal intriguing details about animals, plants and other life-forms that once called Earth home. If humans went extinct, what trace would we leave in the geological record? An announcement this week suggests that humanity has already made an indelible impact and one that warrants a new chapter in Earth’s history. Scientists say they’ve identified a site that marks the birthplace of the Anthropocene — a new geological epoch that captures how profoundly humans have altered the world. The Anthropocene Working Group determined in 2016 that the epoch began around 1950 — the start of the era of nuclear testing. The international research group says that Crawford Lake in Ontario best charts humanity’s impact on Earth. Sediment cored from the lake bed showed geochemical traces of nuclear bomb tests, specifically radioactive plutonium. However, not everyone agrees the Anthropocene is a geological reality — or that researchers have enough evidence to formally declare it a new epoch. Over the course of an 11-year solar cycle, the sun transitions from a calm period to one that is very intense and active. Cool, dark sunspots on the sun’s surface increase in number, causing solar flares and mass ejections of plasma. The peak of the current solar cycle was forecast to take place in July 2025. However, our star is growing increasingly active. Scientists now think the solar maximum, or the peak of solar activity, is more likely to occur in mid-to-late 2024. What does that mean for us on Earth? On the upside, it means that the auroras that dance around Earth’s poles will be visible in more places. However, more intense solar storms can affect electric power grids, GPS and aviation, and satellites in low-Earth orbit. These events also cause radio blackouts and can even pose risks for crewed space missions. Ancient Egyptians used highly formalized workflows to execute their paintings. But these exacting artists didn’t always get everything right the first time. A cutting-edge technique is uncovering hidden details about paintings in two tombs that date back more than 3,000 years. Egyptologist Philippe Martinez of Sorbonne University said one of the tombs was “a little bit like the Mona Lisa of Egypt.” The discoveries were made by using portable chemical imaging technology, which allows researchers to analyze the artwork while inside the tomb rather than waiting to look at it inside a museum or lab. The NASA Mariner 4 mission captured the first photos of another planet taken from space in 1965. The spacecraft flew 6,118 miles (9,846 kilometers) above the surface of Mars, but the first image made public wasn’t quite what the space agency intended. Back then, it took 10 hours to relay a single image to Earth — incredibly slow by today’s standards. As anxiety built during the wait, some members of the Mariner 4 team took matters into their own hands and assembled a “color by numbers” image based on representations of data to make sure the equipment was working properly. Despite the best efforts of NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s communications team, the press glimpsed the hand-colored image, and the artwork became the first close-up shot of Mars from space to be seen on TV. The actual photo was released the next day. In total, Mariner 4 took 22 ground-breaking images, and they revealed craters on the Martian surface, which surprised scientists. Humans not only lived in South America at the same time as giant sloths — they also handcrafted pendants from bony material in the ice age creature’s skin, according to a new study. The maker or makers of the recently discovered three artifacts perforated a hole in the sloth bone and polished them, according to an analysis of microscopic marks. The species of giant sloth the bones belonged to would have weighed more than 1,300 pounds (about 600 kilograms), bigger than most current-day brown bears. The discovery is exciting on two fronts: It puts humans in the Americas several thousand years earlier than many archaeologists thought, and the three pendants are the oldest known personal adornments unearthed on the landmass. Check out these three captivating stories. — The Webb space telescope has been observing the universe for one year, and a stunning new image marks the milestone. — The climate crisis is altering the color of the world’s oceans, although the change isn’t yet visible to the naked eye. — A scorching hot planet that zips around its host star every 19 hours is the shiniest exoplanet ever discovered. Like what you’ve read?

Mark Kelly on Sunday leaned into his experience as an astronaut to call for climate crisis action amid a blistering heatwave across the United States, including his home state of Arizona.                                             ","Paul LeBlanc and Morgan Rimmer, CNN","Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly on Sunday leaned into his experience as an astronaut to call for climate crisis action amid a blistering heatwave across the United States, including his home state of Arizona. “When I went into space four times, I mean, I could see how thin the atmosphere is over this planet. It’s as thin as a contact lens on an eyeball, and we have got to do a better job taking care of it,” Kelly told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “I have not seen in my time in the Senate many folks that deny that the climate is changing. That was a thing of the past. Now is: What do we do about it? We passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a big down payment on reducing the amount of carbon we put up into the atmosphere. That will make a difference over time. We obviously have to do more,” he added. As the climate crisis ratchets temperatures higher and higher, scientists have warned there’s a growing likelihood that 2023 could be the Earth’s hottest year on record. Heat kills more Americans than any other form of severe weather, including flooding, hurricanes or extreme cold, according to National Weather Service data. These climate crisis warnings have been especially potent in recent days as more than 85 million people remain under heat alerts while the weekslong heat wave continues and intensifies in the Southwest. Dangerously high temperatures have continued to plague the western parts of the US throughout the weekend, with temperatures expected to grow hotter in the South in the coming days. More than 100 temperature records could be set through Monday across the West and South. “My view hasn’t really changed. We are suffering a heat wave here in Arizona. It is typically very hot in the summer. This is obviously dangerous to seniors and folks who are living on the streets,” Kelly said Sunday. While scientists say the heat records are alarming, most are unsurprised – though frustrated that their warnings have been largely ignored for decades. The world is “walking into an uncharted territory,” Carlo Buontempo, director of the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, told CNN earlier this month. “We have never seen anything like this in our life.” Kelly also said Sunday he was “concerned” about the impact the group “No Labels” – which is pushing for a third-party unity ticket in 2024 – could have on President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. “I don’t think ‘No Labels’ is a political party. I mean, this is a few individuals putting dark money behind an organization, and that’s not what our democracy should be about; it should not be about a few rich people,” he told Tapper. “So I’m obviously concerned about what’s going on here in Arizona and across the country.” Arizona Democrats have sued over the recognition of No Labels as a political party with the ability to place candidates on the state’s ballot – and potentially play a spoiler role in 2024, when Arizona, which Biden won by less than half a point in 2020, is poised to be a critical swing state. No Labels is set to host an event Monday in New Hampshire, with centrist Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia as a keynote speaker. Kelly said he had spoken to Manchin about the issue but did not offer any details. “I’m not going to go into details of conversations I have with my fellow senators. That’s sort of a policy of mine,” he said. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN’s Eric Bradner, Manu Raju, Jack Forrest, Elizabeth Wolfe and Caitlin Kaiser contributed to this report."

","Heather Chen, CNN","The world’s largest and most populous continent is reckoning with the deadly effects of extreme summer weather, as countries endure blistering heatwaves and record monsoon rainfall, with governments warning residents to prepare for more to come. This month torrential rains inundated parts of Japan, China, South Korea and India, upending the lives of millions and causing flash floods, landslides and power cuts. Record temperatures also led to a rise in heat-related illnesses, particularly among vulnerable communities such as the elderly. On Saturday, at least 13 people in the central South Korean city of Cheongju died after waters from a burst riverbank flooded an underpass, trapping vehicles, including a public bus. At least 41 people have died in South Korea in recent days and thousands more have been forced to evacuate their homes and seek temporary shelter, as heavy downpours hit central and southern parts of the country. In response to the loss of life, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for an overhaul of the country’s approach to extreme weather. “This kind of extreme weather event will become commonplace — we must accept climate change is happening, and deal with it,” Yoon said Monday. In neighboring Japan, record rainfall in the southwest of the country resulted in devastating flooding that left at least six people dead, and many others still missing. “It’s raining like never before,” a spokesman for Japan’s Meteorological Agency said in a statement that called for maximum vigilance from residents in affected areas. It is a pattern seen throughout the region — from parts of the Philippines and Cambodia in the south where widespread flooding has led to transport disruptions in major cities including the capitals Manila and Phnom Penh — to parts of India further north where record rainfall brought several states to a near standstill and claimed the lives of dozens, according to officials. The capital Delhi on July 10 marked its wettest July day in more than 40 years, according to authorities. The heavy downpours forced school closures and left many vulnerable without shelter. While some regions are grappling with deadly downpours, others are facing searing heat. On Monday, a weather station in northeastern China recorded a record high temperature of 52.2 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit), while Japan saw temperatures rise to 39.7 degrees Celsius (103 Fahrenheit). In total, more than five weather stations in China exceeded highs of 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit) Monday — among the hottest in history. This follows a record hot summer in the capital Beijing which saw temperatures in early July soar past 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) — prompting officials to issue heat red alerts for two weeks as the global climate crisis intensifies. The heatwave hits amid the arrival of US Climate Envoy John Kerry in China on Sunday for talks between Beijing and Washington to resume cooperation on climate discussions. China, one of the world’s biggest polluters, has been seeing its share of extreme weather events — with torrential downpours and flooding battering other parts of the country particularly in the south. Heatwaves have also struck parts of Japan. Temperatures as of Monday morning rose to highs of 39.7 degrees Celsius (103 Fahrenheit) in the city of Kiryu, located in Gunma Prefecture on Honshu island — Japan’s largest and most populous which also houses Kyoto and Tokyo, and 39.6 degrees Celsius in Hatoyama a town located in Saitama Prefecture. Cases of heat stroke have become increasingly common among Japan’s elderly, who account for 28% of the population. Temperatures in the capital Tokyo have soared to dangerous levels in recent years, leaving government officials to call for electricity rationing as the country struggles with growing power shortages. Scientists have warned the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events will continue to increase as the human-caused climate crisis accelerates. In its annual climate update, the World Meteorological Organization said the world is on track to breach a critical climate threshold in the next five years as global temperatures continue to climb above pre-industrial levels. Asia, with an estimated total population of 4.4 billion people, is acutely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with recent bouts of extreme weather resulting in water shortages, crop failures and a slow down in the economy. That vulnerability was thrown into sharp focus last year when catastrophic flooding hit Pakistan killing more than 1,700 people and leaving millions homeless. The South Asian country is now dealing with its worst economic crisis in decades, worsened by inflation spiking because of the floods ruining last year’s harvests. “One thing is very clear: what happened in Pakistan will not stay in Pakistan,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in September last year, warning that climate change would not spare countries. “The entire definition of national security has changed today. And unless the leaders of the world come together to act and act now on an agreed common agenda, there will be no earth to fight wars over. Nature will be fighting back. And for that, humanity is no match at all.” Neighboring India, the world’s most populous nation, is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), potentially affecting 1.4 billion people nationwide. After suffering recent blistering heat waves in the north and east, thousands were then forced to flee severe flooding in states like Himachal Pradesh last week after heavy rains battered villages and turned roads into rivers. Every year, India is hit by severe flooding and landslides during the monsoon season, which drenches the country from June to September. Assam, a state with a population of more than 31 million people, is among the worst hit. More than 495,000 people spread across 22 districts were impacted by floodwaters and about 14,000 evacuated to relief camps when rain swept across the region. Disaster management officials and state authorities in late June reported at least 10 deaths since the rains began. Video broadcast on local television showed villagers wading neck-deep through the muddy water with their cattle, and homes, shops and cars submerged in the floods. Red alerts, indicating the highest threat level, were issued for several northern states including Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Haryana. Landslide warnings were also issued for Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. The heavy downpours also forced school closures in a number of areas including Uttar Pradesh and the capital New Delhi. The impact of such weather extremes is hard to miss and India’s poor are among the most vulnerable. Floods have posed a particular danger to the 35% of the population — roughly 472 million people — who live in urban slums, according to the World Bank. “The irony of it is that the poor of the world are actually victims of climate change,” even if they aren’t the ones who “created the problem,” Sunita Narain, director general of the Centre for Science and Environment and veteran Indian environmentalist told CNN last year. “Floods, droughts and other devastating climate events are “all showing us very clearly what will the future be,” she added."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Blisteringly high temperatures are expected to continue across parts of southern Europe this week, as the continent braces for its second extreme heat wave, putting people’s health at risk and setting the stage for wildfires. Last week’s “Cerberus” heat wave is making way for another, which Italian weather forecasters have named “Charon” – the ferryman in Greek mythology who carries souls to the underworld. Italy, Spain and Greece have already faced unrelenting heat for days, but the European Space Agency has warned that the heat wave is only just beginning. In Italy, which has been particularly hard hit, temperatures in many cities are expected to soar above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist and professor at the University of Reading, compared the effect to that of a giant oven over the Mediterranean. “The bubble of hot air that has inflated over southern Europe has turned Italy and surrounding countries into a giant pizza oven,” she said in a statement Monday. “The hot air which pushed in from Africa is now staying put, with settled high pressure conditions meaning that heat in warm sea, land and air continues to build,” Cloke explained. Extreme heat is being felt around the world, with the head of the World Health Organization on Monday urging world leaders to “act now” on the climate crisis. “In many parts of the world, today is predicted to be the hottest day on record,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet on Monday. “The #ClimateCrisis is not a warning. It’s happening. I urge world leaders to ACT now,” he also said. High temperatures hit 52.2 degrees Celsius (126 Fahrenheit) on Sunday in northwest China. While in the US, California’s Death Valley reached nearly 52 degrees Celsius (125.6) on Sunday. As the human-caused climate crisis accelerates, scientists are clear that extreme weather events such as heat waves will only become more frequent and more intense. Global temperatures have already risen 1.2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels due to humans burning planet-heating fossil fuels. “This is just the beginning,” said Simon Lewis, the chair of global change science at the University College London. “Current policies globally have us hitting 2.7 degrees (Celsius) warming by 2100. That’s truly terrifying,” Lewis said in a statement. “As scientists agreed last year: There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. Deep, rapid and sustained cuts in carbon emissions to net zero can halt the warming, but humanity will have to adapt to even more severe heatwaves in the future.” he said. Last month was the planet’s hottest June on record by a substantial margin, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, accompanied by record high ocean temperatures and record low levels of Antarctic ice. That unprecedented heat has continued into this month. The first week of July was the hottest week on record, according to preliminary data from the World Meteorological Organization, putting the planet into what Christopher Hewitt, WMO climate services director, described as “uncharted territory.” Extreme heat is among the deadliest weather phenomena. Chris Hilson, the director of the University of Reading’s Centre for Climate and Justice, noted “news reports from tourist hotspots like the Acropolis and Rome have tended to make this extreme weather event seem merely like a summer holiday inconvenience.” However, he said, the reality is that “these heatwaves often lead to many premature deaths, especially among the elderly.” “This is a matter of climate justice or fairness because climate harms such as extreme heat are being unequally felt,” Hilson said, and “we must ensure that we continue to cut polluting emissions of carbon dioxide to prevent these events from becoming even more frequent; but the authorities also need to put adaptation measures in place with an eye on these unequally felt harms.” These measures include “cool zones or drop-in centres with transport to get there, more trees in relevant residential neighbourhoods, and appropriate (and preferably renewable-powered) aircon in care homes,” Hilson added. As a high pressure anticyclone pushes up from North Africa, temperatures in Europe are expected to come close to, or even breach, the continent’s record of 48.8 degrees Celsius (118.4 degrees Fahrenheit) set in 2021, according to the ESA. The peak of Italy’s heat will be between Monday and Wednesday, according to Italian weather news service Meteo.it, with temperatures expected to climb above 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Temperatures will remain high at night meaning there will be little respite from the heat. Italian authorities have advised people to drink plenty of water, eat lighter meals and avoid direct sunlight between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. In Greece, where temperatures have risen above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), authorities were forced to close the Acropolis in Athens, from noon to 5pm local time on Friday and again over the weekend. In Spain, temperatures in the cities of Seville, Cordoba and Granada have reached 40 degrees Celsius. Even the normally cooler region of Navarra in the north of the country is experiencing up to 40 degrees Celsius. The heat has also helped prime the land for fires. Wildfires on the island of La Palma in Spain’s Canary Islands, which started on Saturday morning, have burned through 4,650 hectares (11,490 acres), destroying 20 houses and forcing the emergency evacuation of thousands of people, according to a Reuters report. Fires have also broken out on Tenerife, another of the Canary Islands, forcing around 50 people to evacuate and burning through around 60 hectares (123 acres). In Greece, more than 500 firefighters are trying to control the four wildfires. In the area of Loutraki – a popular seaside town in the Peloponnese, southwest of Athens – 1,200 children were evacuated from a summer camp amid a wildfire there, local mayor Giorgos Gkionis told Greek media.  A nursing home was also evacuated. Meanwhile, two large wildfires are raging southeast and northwest of Athens. The largest of the two started after midday local time in the area of Kouvaras – southeast of Athens – and expanded 7 miles in the first two hours. Residents of Kouvaras as well as the nearby seaside resorts of Saronida, Anavyssos and Lagonisi have been ordered to protectively evacuate. A fire also closed the airport Monday in the city of Catania on the Italian island of Sicily, with flights suspended until 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday, according to a Twitter post from the airport authorities. Firefighters have controlled the fire and it’s not yet clear if the region’s high temperatures played any role. Catania was one of several cities under a hot weather red alert on Sunday, according to a Reuters report. Sugam Pokharel, Chris Liakos, Sharon Braithwaite, Angela Fritz, Al Goodman and Barbie Latza Nadeau contributed reporting"

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. The Atlantic hurricane season is headed into uncharted territory with water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico warmer than they have ever been on record. Seasonal forecasters are warning it means you need to prepare for a more uncertain forecast for the rest of the season with the potential for more storms and stronger ones. Warm ocean water is one of the key ingredients for fueling hurricanes and it’s been in abundance so far this year. Scientists first sounded the alarm in April and the ocean warmth has only escalated since. Water in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic has been record warm, especially for this early in the year. It includes off the coast of Florida, where water temperatures in the Florida Keys were close to 97 degrees in some spots last week. It is important because warm ocean water breeds stronger, bigger and wetter storms. It gives hurricanes the energy they need to grow and sometimes rapidly intensify, something hurricane forecasters told CNN we could see more of this season. Warm oceans can also lead to more evaporation and wring out more rainfall falling from any storms. But hurricane season predictions involve more than just warm water. It’s just one factor in the birth and survival of tropical cyclones, and it is creating more uncertainty than usual in what could happen the rest of the hurricane season. “Uncertainty, uncertainty, uncertainty! That’s really the story going forward with this season,” Dr. Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University told me. Klotzbach and the team at CSU are some of the pioneers of long-term hurricane season outlooks, and just increased the number of expected hurricanes and major hurricanes in their prediction for this season due to the warmer water in the Atlantic. What makes this year even more uncertain is we are now under the influence of El Niño which typically suppresses activity in the Atlantic with increased wind shear, the changing of wind direction and speed with height which can blow budding storms to pieces and shred existing storms to death. Klotzbach said the confluence of these record warm temperatures at the same time as a moderate to strong El Niño hasn’t been “observed historically.” The million-dollar question right now is which will win out: warm ocean temperatures or El Niño. Early season predictions called for a near-average season, but Klotzbach and team seem to think the warm water will win out and are now calling for “an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season.” Warm water won in June. According to Klotzbach, June had the lowest wind shear in the southern Atlantic Basin since 1988. Arlene, Bret and Cindy formed as a result. Wind shear and dry air from Saharan dust picked up in the month of July, suppressing hurricane activity for the most part, but August through October could be different. “Most climate models are forecasting slightly to somewhat-below normal shear in August, September and even into October,” Klotzbach said. “If that were the case, we would likely have an extremely busy season given how warm the Atlantic is.” As of now, there’s not much noteworthy on the horizon as far as tropical development goes.  Subtropical Storm Don is meandering around the north-central Atlantic but poses no threat to land. Forecast models aren’t picking up any development this week. Forecasts for next week are hinting at some tropical development, but it’s far too early to have confidence in how, if or when this could materialize. What we do know is hurricane season typically starts ramping up as we head into August. The first hurricane usually forms in early to mid-August. The eight-week span from mid-August through mid-October is when ocean temperatures are nearing their highest levels in the Atlantic, wind shear lessens considerably and when nearly 90% of all hurricane activity in the Atlantic happens. The bottom line is this season is already unprecedented given the hot ocean temperatures, so forecasting the season in the uncharted territory we’ve entered is a challenge. We’ve got a lot of hurricane season left to go, which means you should prepare for the worst and hope for the best."

","Jacopo Prisco, CNN","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. A phenomenon that scientists have called “underground climate change” is deforming the ground beneath cities, a study conducted in Chicago has found. This shifting of land under urban areas could pose a problem for buildings and infrastructure, threatening long-term performance and durability, according to the research. Technically known as “subsurface heat islands,” underground climate change is the warming of the ground under our feet, caused by heat released by buildings and subterranean transportation such as subway systems. “The denser the city, the more intense is underground climate change,” said lead study author Alessandro Rotta Loria, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Soil, rocks and construction materials deform when subjected to temperature variations. For example, the ground underneath buildings can contract when heated, causing unwanted settlement, Rotta Loria said. “Deformations caused by underground climate change are relatively small in magnitude, but they continuously develop,” he said. “Over time, they can become very significant for the operational performance of civil infrastructure like building foundations, water retaining walls, tunnels and so on.” But underground climate change is not the same as what we think of as climate change in the atmosphere, which is largely driven by greenhouse gases and has far-reaching effects, said David Archer, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago. “Calling it climate change seems like a bit of a coattail thing,” Archer, who was not involved with the study, said. The term “underground climate change,” however, was not coined for this study — it has been in use, and the phenomenon a subject of research, for some time. Studied for the past 25 years, underground climate change can cause issues such as groundwater contamination or problems with underground railways by making tracks prone to buckling or causing passengers to become ill due to excessive heat. Its effects on civil infrastructure, however, had not been explored until this study, according to Rotta Loria. The research, published this month in the journal Communications Engineering, was conducted by installing 150 temperature sensors across the Chicago Loop district, both above and below ground, and in a variety of places such as basements, tunnels and parking garages. Sensors were also placed in Grant Park along Lake Michigan to compare temperatures from an unbuilt area with no excess heat coming from construction or transportation. Data was collected over three years, and the results showed that the ground under the Loop was up to 18 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) warmer than the ground beneath the park. “We found underground structures, such as basements, where the air temperature was very high,” Rotta Loria said. “And the consequence of that is that at least a portion of the heat will diffuse towards the ground over time, and that’s the origin of the phenomenon.” Researchers then used the data to build a computer model of the Chicago Loop and simulate the effect of the rising temperatures on the ground, from the 1950s until the 2050. They found that depending on the composition of the soil, the ground reacts unevenly to warming and can both expand and contract by amounts that — while imperceptible to humans — could cause problems for buildings. “It’s important to stress that underground climate change does not threaten the safety of people and does not threaten to collapse structures and buildings,” Rotta Loria said. “It does pose a potential challenge for the functionality and the durability of structures, because excessive ground deformations can lead to distortion, tilting and potentially cracking.” As a result, water could flow more easily into cracked structures, potentially causing corrosion in materials such as reinforced concrete. “There is what I call a silent hazard,” Rotta Loria said. “Buildings that are more prone to issues, because they were designed and built with outdated approaches, are also those that contribute the most to underground climate change, because they lack appropriate thermal insulation and therefore inject the most heat into the ground.” It’s not all doom and gloom, however, according to Rotta Loria. “This study can make us realize that we are in front of an opportunity — we can take action, and in different ways,” he said. Future buildings will not significantly increase the phenomenon, because modern construction technologies and regulations mandate better insulation and energy efficiency. And for those structures that already exist, understanding underground heat presents opportunities, according to Rotta Loria. “We can take action by applying thermal insulation to underground building enclosures, to minimize the amount of waste heat that goes into the ground,” he said. “But if for any reason we aren’t able to thermally insulate the buildings to enhance their energy efficiency, we could at least deploy geothermal technologies underneath or next to them to absorb the waste heat that is generated and use it for heating and cooling.” David Toll, a professor of engineering and codirector of the Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience at Durham University in the United Kingdom, said the study is important as the effects of thermal movements of the ground beneath cities have not been a focus of much research. “My conclusion from the study would be that, for the Chicago Loop, we now know that these thermal movements that have taken place, and those predicted for the immediate future,  are not large enough to be of concern. That is a very useful finding,” said Toll, who did not participate in the research. “However, that is not to say that such temperature changes below other cities, with different ground conditions, could not be potentially problematic.”"

","Ivana Kottasová, CNN","The optics of a major oil-producing country organizing the world’s most important climate conference, and appointing an oil company CEO to lead it, are not lost on anyone – including, it seems, the hosts: the United Arab Emirates. The country has embarked on a major PR campaign to boost its green credentials ahead of the COP28 UN climate summit in Dubai later this year, prompting heavy criticism from climate groups and some politicians. At the same time, researchers are raising red flags over allegations of more covert influence campaigns, as members of the COP28 team were found by the Centre for Climate Reporting and the Guardian to have been editing Wikipedia pages about the conference’s chief, and an army of fake social media accounts has appeared, promoting the country’s climate record. The UAE insists it is “ideally suited” to host COP28, but some climate researchers are concerned these campaigns point to a lack of genuine ambition for the crucial summit, which comes as the world experiences record-breaking heat, deadly rain and flooding, and devastating storms. It “raises a lot of alarm bells about how much these kinds of influence operations are going to ramp up and become more sophisticated and complex as we get nearer to the time,” said Jennie King, the head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). The climate summit takes place at a different location each year, with responsibility for hosting rotating among five regional groups. Other COP summits have also been mired in controversy – and most ended up in deals described, at best, as underwhelming. The 2018 conference took place in Katowice, a town in the middle of Poland’s coal country. The UK, which hosted the 2021 summit in Glasgow, is a major oil and gas producer. But the UAE stands out because of the way it chose to intertwine the summit with its oil business. In January, the UAE announced Sultan Al Jaber would be the summit president, to the horror of many climate groups. Al Jaber is the UAE’s climate envoy and the founder of a renewable energy company, but he is also CEO of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). The COP28 team told CNN Al Jaber “has a single-minded focus on delivering a transformational COP that unites the world around tangible climate action.” But for critics, it is a clear conflict of interest to have the head of a huge fossil fuel company presiding over a climate conference. And it wasn’t just climate organizations that objected. In May, more than 100 members of the US Congress and the European Parliament called for him to step down, claiming his appointment risked undermining the negotiations. Al Jaber’s subsequent comments have done little to calm their concerns. He was criticized in May when he called for a phase out of “fossil fuel emissions,” rather than the fossil fuels themselves, which seemed to leave the door open for continued use of oil, coal and gas while relying on technology to deal with the planet-heating pollution they produce. But Al Jaber has also received some important endorsements. US climate envoy John Kerry told Associated Press that he was “a terrific choice,” citing his commitment to expanding renewable energy. The EU climate chief Frans Timmermans said he had “confidence” in Al Jaber, highlighting his track record as someone who “started with sustainability policies long before anyone else in the oil and gas sector.” Al Jaber has recently made more ambitious statements – saying the world must “phase down” fossil fuels themselves – but has so far avoided calling for the complete phase-out of oil, coal and gas that scientific organizations such as Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) say is essential to tackle the climate crisis. It’s not just what’s being said in speeches that is concerning some climate groups; it’s also what’s unfolding online. In May, members of the COP28 team were accused of attempting to “greenwash” Al Jaber’s image through edits to his Wikipedia page, as first reported by the Centre for Climate Reporting and the Guardian. The log of edits shows that one user, whose identity is unknown but disclosed being paid by ADNOC, requested references to a major oil deal struck by Al Jaber be removed and that references to critical media coverage be deleted. An admin rejected the edits, saying “well sourced material that includes pertinent information… would always be retained.” The COP28 team did not respond to CNN’s specific questions about the Wikipedia allegations. Then, in June, researchers started drawing attention to certain Twitter activity. Climate Action Against Disinformation Project published research last month flagging more than two dozen Twitter accounts that displayed “unusual quote-tweeting behavior” on tweets from either the UAE’s main COP28 Twitter account or other accounts posting about COP28. “These accounts all quote-tweeted many of the same tweets, using similar (but not identical) language, often adding hashtags associated with sustainability or net zero,” the research said. The same month, disinformation expert Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Qatar, uncovered a large number of fake Twitter accounts promoting the UAE’s environmental record and tweeting in support of Al Jaber. In a Substack post describing the operation, Jones showed how many of these accounts used stock images, AI-generated images or those found online as profile pictures, and have detailed bios that make them appear legitimate. King said that while it’s impossible to definitively say the accounts are affiliated to the UAE or funded by anybody involved in the COP summit, “they do seem to align uncannily with the key messages that are coming out of petrochemical states and in particular, the UAE.” Data from Twitter on the number of accounts by country that the company blocked last year due to state-backed influence operations shows the UAE very near the top of the list. While the UAE COP28 presidency team did not answer specific questions about the Twitter accounts, in June, a COP28 spokesperson told the Guardian the accounts were “generated by outside actors unconnected to Cop28 and are clearly designed to discredit Cop28 and the climate process.” The UAE rejects criticism that it is not up to the job of hosting the world’s biggest climate summit. It was the first in the Middle East to ratify the Paris Agreement on climate and also the first in the region to set 2030 and 2050 emission reduction targets, the COP28 team told CNN. The country upped its climate target this week, pledging to cut planet-heating pollution by 40% below a “business as usual” scenario by 2030 – up from a previous target of 31%. It has committed to reaching net zero by 2050. UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment told CNN in a statement that the new target showed “the UAE is prepared to ‘walk the talk’ on climate action. Climate Action Tracker, a watchdog that assesses national climate plans, said the UAE’s new target was “an improvement on its 2022 submission.” However, it stressed that the country’s current policies were “likely not enough to reach its target” because they include expanding, rather than reducing or oil and gas production. Fossil fuels remain a key source of wealth for the UAE, with the oil and gas industry responsible for 30% of the country’s GDP, according to official government data. While the country is investing heavily in renewable energy, it is also planning to expand its oil and gas production. ADNOC, the state-owned company headed by Al Jaber, has announced a major five-year $150 billion expansion plan, which will see an increase in its oil-producing capacity to five million barrels per day by 2025, up from 4 million in 2020 and planning major expansion of its biggest field, the Upper Zakum oil field. The UAE, however, has been spending lots of money to emphasize how green it is. Filings with the US Justice Department show that the government and various state-run companies have hired some of the world’s biggest PR companies to boost the country’s climate image. While it is usual for COP hosts to engage PR services, some experts say the UAE has been particularly ambitious in its push. The UAE is among the most active countries when it comes to image-boosting campaigns, said Kat Ainger, an editor at the Corporate Europe Observatory, a group that researches lobbying. “Where there are figures published, for example in the US, you can see that the UAE is one of the very top spenders globally and when you [consider] its population, it’s really disproportionate compared to countries like China or India,” she told CNN. A UAE government official told CNN in an email that the large amount of money the country spends on lobbying and PR campaigns in the US is not unusual, given the close relationship between the US and UAE. The official said UAE has built an “enduring partnership” with the US on a number of issues, including regional security, generate economic prosperity, climate change, food security, and multilateral action. One of the reasons that many climate groups are so concerned is that this summit will be crucial for the future of the planet. Not only does it come at a time where the world is seeing climate chaos firsthand, but this summit is seen as particularly important because it will include a “global stocktake,”  where countries will assess how far they have come on cutting planet-heating pollution and ensuring global temperatures don’t rise beyond a critical tipping point. Eight years after striking a landmark climate agreement in Paris, progress has been far from sufficient, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which means negotiators in Dubai must come up with a plan to slash emissions more quickly. The IPCC is clear on what needs to happen: The world must stop burning fossil fuels, which produce around 75% of human-caused planet-heating pollution. Climate groups say serious concerns remain about whether the UAE can provide the level of ambition needed. “The country responsible not only for physically hosting people and setting the tenor and the tone of the event, but also for coordinating the agenda and setting out what the key articles of negotiation and focus are going to be over the next six to eight months, is very clearly working against its own economic business model in hosting the event,” King told CNN. The UAE does not agree. The country is “ideally suited to host” the summit, a spokesperson for the COP28 presidency told CNN."

","Nectar Gan, CNN","China will follow its own path to cut carbon emissions, leader Xi Jinping vowed Tuesday, as US climate envoy John Kerry called for faster action to confront the climate crisis in a high-profile visit to Beijing. Xi told a national conference on environmental protection that China’s commitment to its duel carbon goals – reaching a carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 – is “unwavering,” according to state news agency Xinhua. “But the path, method, pace and intensity to achieve this goal should and must be determined by ourselves, and will never be influenced by others,” he said. The comments came as Kerry met China’s Premier Li Qiang and top diplomat Wang Yi Tuesday, with  Washington and Beijing – the world’s two largest polluters – resuming their long-stalled climate talks amid scorching heat waves across much of the globe. In the meeting with Li, Kerry stressed the “need for China to decarbonize the power sector, cut methane emissions, and reduce deforestation,” a spokesperson for the US State Department said in a statement. He also urged China to “take additional steps to enhance its climate ambition in order to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.” China has invested heavily in clean energy in recent years. Its solar capacity is now greater than the rest of the world combined, and the country is also leading the world in wind capacity and electric vehicles. On the other hand, it has accelerated the approval of new coal plants due to a renewed focus on “energy security,” sparking concerns from environmentalists that these new projects will make the shift away from coal slower and more difficult. But Xi’s remarks at the conference suggest that China has no desire to be pushed, or be seen to cave to pressure – especially from the United States. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Kerry said that none of the officials he met with expressed the kinds of concerns Chinese president Xi expressed in his Tuesday remarks. Kerry stressed he and Chinese officials are trying to find ways to work together and that there’s “no politics or ideology” in their work. “We’re not involved in dictating anything to anybody; we’re involved in following the science,” Kerry said. “None of the leaders I met with suggested there was any reason we shouldn’t be coordinating the way we are, working together in the way we are.” Getting China to phase down its coal remains one of the biggest US goals in climate talks, Kerry said. China has relied on coal to both power its economy and help stabilize its electric grid during periods of extreme heat. “One of the topics of conversation we had here in Beijing and will continue is how can we help accelerate a transition in a way that doesn’t cripple the economy or reduce people’s ability to use some of the things they need today?” Kerry said. Kerry did not come away from his meeting with new concrete commitments from China on phasing out its coal use or decreasing its methane emissions, but said conversations and further engagement would happen in the lead-up to the UN climate summit in December. “These conversations are going to be fairly intense, because we are trying to break new ground and that’s hard,” Kerry said. China and the US are the world’s two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, so any attempt to address the climate crisis will need to involve deep emissions cuts from these two powerhouse nations. China’s emissions are more than double those of the US, but historically, the US has emitted more than any other country in the world. China and other fast developing nations have long argued that the world’s richest countries, especially those in the West, were able to become wealthy while churning out huge carbon emissions for decades. Relations between the US and China are at their worst in years with the world’s two largest economies feuding over a host of issues, from geopolitics to trade and technology. The US has said climate cooperation with China should be a standalone issue, separate from their disputes. But Beijing views it differently. Last year, it cut off climate talks with the US in protest at then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan – in the middle of the worst heat wave China had seen in six decades. It also halted cooperation on other common causes issues, including communications between military and law enforcement. That difference in views has been on full display in Beijing, even as the two sides return to the table to restart talks. When meeting Wang, China’s top diplomat, on Tuesday, Kerry stressed the two countries “cannot let bilateral differences stand in the way of making concrete progress” on climate cooperation. But Wang insisted this cooperation “cannot be separated from the overall environment of Sino-US relations.” He urged the US to pursue a “rational, pragmatic and positive policy toward China” and “properly handle the Taiwan issue,” referring to the democratic self-ruled island that Beijing claims sovereignty over. On Wednesday, Kerry reiterated his message to Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng that climate should be handled separately from broader diplomatic issues, Reuters reported. Acknowledging the diplomatic difficulties between the two sides in recent years, Kerry said climate should be treated as a “free-standing” challenge that requires the collective efforts of the world’s largest economies to resolve, according to Reuters. CNN’s Ella Nilsen contributed to this story."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Summer in the Northern Hemisphere is playing out like an apocalypse movie: a tale of heat, floods and fire. But scientists warn this may only be a preview of the unpredictable chaos to come if the world continues to pump out planet-heating pollution. Just over halfway through July and already a slew of extreme weather records has been broken. A prolonged, unrelenting heat wave has scorched large parts of the South and Southwest United States. Temperatures in Phoenix, Arizona, have hit at least 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3C) for a record-breaking 19 consecutive days, and emergency departments are flooded with heat-related illness. Southern Europe is experiencing one of its most extreme heat waves on record, with wildfires raging in Greece, Spain and Switzerland. And in Asia, temperatures have pushed above 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in China, while parts of South Korea, Japan and northern India are experiencing deadly flooding. In a statement on Tuesday, Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, called this relentless cascade of extreme weather “the new normal.” But some scientists now baulk at that framing. “When I hear it, I get a bit crazy because it’s not really the new normal,” said Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist and professor at the University of Reading in the UK. “Until we stop pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere we have no idea what the future looks like.” She is one of many scientists who warn that, while this summer is very bad, it’s only just the beginning. As long as global temperature continues to rise, they said, the world should brace for escalating impacts. Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist and distinguished professor at the University of Pennsylvania, prefers to describe the weather we are seeing as “the new abnormal.” The new normal “wrongly conveys the idea that we’ve simply arrived in some new climate state and that we simply have to adapt to it,” he told CNN. “But it’s much worse than that. The impacts become worse and worse as fossil fuel burning and warming continues. It’s a shifting baseline of ever-more devastating impacts as long as the Earth continues to warm.” For scientists like Mann and Cloke, this year’s extreme weather has largely not been surprising. The development of El Niño, a natural phenomenon that has a global warming impact, layered on top of longterm, human-caused global warming, was expected to have a big impact. But regionally, there have been “some remarkable anomalies,” said Mann, who pointed to record-low levels of winter sea ice in Antarctica and “off the charts” heat in the North Atlantic. “They are a reminder that we can not only expect to see records broken, but shattered, if we continue burning fossil fuels.” As the climate crisis accelerates, the stage is set for more surprises. “The weather extremes will continue to become more intense and our weather patterns could change in ways we yet can’t predict,” said Peter Stott, a science fellow in climate attribution, at the UK Met Office. In some cases, the heat, fire and floods are already exceeding what climate models have predicted, Mann said. In part, this is due to changes in the jet stream, he said. The jet stream is driven by the temperature difference between the poles and the equator. As the Arctic rapidly warms, that temperature difference reduces and the jet stream slows and weakens. This can mean that weather systems can get locked into place for prolonged periods. “The same region gets baked day after day, or rained on day after day – just the sort of behavior we’re seeing this summer,” Mann said. It will be hard for countries to adapt to these new extremes, said Vikki Thompson, a climate scientist at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. “We will see combinations of events that could lead to unexpected impacts. Extreme heat could be quickly followed by heavy rainfall impacting society, agriculture, and ecosystems in unusual ways,” she told CNN. Countries tend to prepare for the worst they have experienced, but with climate extremes smashing current records, “we need to be prepared for situations that might currently appear impossible,” Thompson said. While the world is already locked into some impacts of global warming, due to the global failure to cut planet-heating pollution, scientists are clear that there is still time to avert the worst consequences. The latest science shows that global temperature rise would halt almost immediately after we stop burning fossil fuels, Mann said. And this summer is more evidence that every fraction of a degree by which the world is able to limit global heating will count, Cloke told CNN. The planet is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before the industrial revolution – still short of the 1.5 degrees scientists are warning the planet should stay under. But even now, the consequences are deadly and far-reaching. “It is really frightening,” she said. “But the more action that we take, the sooner that we take that action, the better our future will be.” Read more: Why nighttime heat can be so dangerous – and why it’s getting worse Summer has become a survival test as heat gets more extreme 2023 could be the hottest year on record"

But local, state and federal aid programs and infrastructure to help people cool down haven’t kept up with the country’s record-shattering temperatures.                                             ","Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN","Extreme heat in the summer has become America’s brutal new reality. But local, state and federal aid programs and infrastructure to help people cool down haven’t kept up with the country’s record-shattering temperatures. Climate, energy and urban researchers are urging policymakers to implement solutions to mitigate the danger of heat on vulnerable residents and design cooler cities and towns for a hotter future. “There is no national plan to help lower-income families to transition to higher temperatures,” said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, which represents state energy assistance programs for low-income Americans. “The solutions we have are based on shorter heat waves and more temperate summers. Public policy hasn’t caught up.” Wolfe is calling for congressional funding to retrofit low-income homes for cooling. This effort would pay for energy-efficient air conditioning equipment and insulation. It would also include building code changes that require multi-family homes provide cooling the same way they do heating. Last year, Chicago passed a law requiring certain new and existing residential buildings to install air conditioners in indoor common areas, and Los Angeles is exploring an air conditioner requirement for all rental units. But that won’t be enough to keep people cool as temperatures rise. Cities are warmer than their surrounding areas, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect, and they need to be better designed to keep people cool, researchers say. This will require investments in urban trees, forests and infrastructure. That means planting more trees and building shade structures; so-called cool roofs and streets with reflective surfaces to lower temperatures; and updated building codes. “We can’t just air condition our way out of the problem,” said Rushad Nanavatty, managing director of RMI, a clean energy think tank that is part of the Cool Coalition, a United Nations-led effort to address urban cooling. “We don’t view urban nature as infrastructure, but that’s exactly what it is. We spend an order of magnitude less on it than we should if you consider the full range of benefits.” Underfunded energy assistance programs and poorly designed urban areas put low-income, elderly and other vulnerable Americans most at risk when temperatures spike. Most low-income families have access to cooling in their homes, but they lack the money to turn it on, costing them an average of 8.6% of their income to pay for home energy — three times that of higher-income families, according to the US Department of Energy. And prices will rise this summer by 11.7% to an average of $578, up from $517 last summer, according to the NEADA. Heat is a major public health concern, but its priority in federal and state assistance programs is not proportionate. Heat kills more Americans every year than any other weather-related disaster. Each year, an average of more than 700 people die from heat and more than 9,000 people are hospitalized nationally due to heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But experts say the death tolls and hospitalization rates are vastly under-counted. “Extreme heat hasn’t been thought of in the same vain as other disasters and emergency situations,” said Nanavatty. “Extreme heat is an increasing emergency, but our response isn’t there.” Take, for example, the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides formula grants to states to help low-income families pay their heating and cooling bills. About 80% of the program’s funding is used by states to help families pay their heating bills, Mark Wolfe said, leaving little money left for families to pay for cooling bills in the summer. Additionally, fewer states have protections against power shutoffs during the summer than they do for heating in the winter. Twenty states and Washington, DC, bar certain utility companies from disconnecting customers for nonpayment during extreme heat, while 40 states have cutoff protections during the winter. “The programs are rooted in cold weather. They were designed 40 years ago when summer temperatures were much cooler,” Mark Wolfe said. “Our approach toward cooling is much weaker than our approach toward heating.” His organization has called for increased funding for LIHEAP, which only helps one out of six households who are eligible, and a national moratorium on shutting families off from power this summer. Public health departments and governments often run cooling centers in schools or other air-conditioned buildings when temperatures rise, but there are limitations to these centers. A study published last year by the CDC found that in two counties in Arizona, Maricopa and Yuma, “several barriers inhibit cooling center use, including the inability to bring pets and limited access by public transportation.” Most places also do not open cooling centers unless the temperature rises to a certain level. New York City, for example, has not opened its cooling centers because the National Weather Service hasn’t issued a heat advisory. But the city’s health department recorded nearly 150 heat-related emergency room visits over a two week stretch in July, compared to 20 last year. Cities need to expand their definitions of cooling centers to movie theaters, shopping malls, parks, transit hubs and other conveniently-located areas, researchers say, and keep them open for longer. Cities can also provide more shade for residents and design cool roofs and streets to protect people from extreme heat. “Cities themselves contribute to heat and how a person experiences heat waves,” said V. Kelly Turner, an assistant professor of urban planning and geography at UCLA. “The two big way cities are trying to address heat are through shade and reflective surfaces — cool pavements and cool roofs.” Pavements and roofs comprise over 60% of urban surfaces, and cities can require new buildings and surfaces to use materials that lighten the surface color of roofs and streets to reflect, not absorb, sunlight. Trees and vegetation also lower surface and air temperatures. Shaded surfaces, for example, may be 20 to 45 degrees cooler than the peak temperatures of unshaded materials, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Vegetation is most useful as a heat mitigation strategy when it is planted in strategic locations around buildings or to shade pavement in parking lots and on streets. In Miami-Dade County, the city has an initiative to cover 30% of the county with tree canopies. “How do we make people feel cooler — the most effective way we can do that is shade,” said Turner. CNN’s Rachel Ramirez and Tami Luhby contributed to this article."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","As millions bake under a relentless heat wave in the South and Southwest US – and as temperatures soar around the Northern Hemisphere – NASA scientists warned Thursday that we haven’t even seen the worst of El Niño and next year will likely be even warmer for the planet. Climate change, caused by burning fossil fuels, is unequivocally warming the Earth’s temperature, NASA scientists said. And El Niño, the natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific that brings warmer-than-average sea-surface temperatures and influences weather, has only just started in recent months and therefore is not having a huge impact yet on the extreme heat people around the globe are experiencing this summer, said Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “It’s really only just emerged, and so what we’re seeing is not really due to that El Niño,” Schmidt told reporters. “What we’re seeing is the overall warmth pretty much everywhere – particularly in the oceans. … The reason why we think that’s going to continue is because we continue to put greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Until we stop doing that, temperatures will keep on rising.” Last month was the hottest June on record for the planet, the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service reported earlier this month. Several days in July were the planet’s warmest in modern records kept by two climate agencies in the US and Europe. All of that heat is adding up, and Schmidt said he believes there is a 50-50 chance that 2023 will be the warmest year on record. But, he added, it is likely that a sweltering 2024 will exceed it, precisely because of El Niño’s influence. “We anticipate that 2024 is going to be an even warmer year because we’re going to be starting off with that El Niño event,” Schmidt said. “That will peak towards the end of this year, and how big that is is going to have a big impact on the following year’s statistics.” Scientists also discussed the devastating impact climate change is having on the Earth’s oceans, as North Atlantic Ocean temperatures have soared this summer. “The oceans are running a fever,” said Carlos Del Castillo, chief of NASA’s Ocean Ecology Laboratory. “This issue with ocean temperature is not a problem that stays in the ocean – it affects everything else.” Castillo noted hotter ocean temperatures can make hurricanes stronger and make ocean levels rice due to glacial melt. Schmidt noted that rising temperatures are in line with what scientists have predicted as humans burn more fossil fuels and pump more greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. “Even the things that are unprecedented are not surprising,” Schmidt said."

The national average price for regular gasoline surged by 4 cents a gallon on Tuesday to $3.64 a gallon, according to AAA.                                             ","Matt Egan, CNN","The monthslong calm in gas prices is over. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline surged by 4 cents on Tuesday to $3.64, according to AAA. That marks the biggest one-day increase since June 7, 2022, according to a CNN review of AAA data. However, gas prices are much lower today than they were last summer, when they spiked above $5 a gallon. “All of a sudden, things have popped up after a long period of low prices,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. As recently as July 4, gas prices had experienced a nearly unprecedented year-over-year decline. The unwelcome shift higher in pump prices follows a jump in oil prices, which have climbed to three-month highs as part of a broader rally in commodities. Wheat and corn prices have rallied after Russian attacks on port infrastructure in Ukraine. The timing is tricky. Cooling inflation, driven in part by easing gas prices, has raised hopes that the United States can avoid a recession. Investors are betting the Federal Reserve will soon be able to wrap up its inflation fight. And consumers have been feeling better, with consumer confidence hitting a two-year high in July. A return of higher food and fuel prices could unravel those positive trends. To be sure, gas prices are still down by 72 cents a gallon from a year ago. And the national average remains far from the record high of $5.02 a gallon last June. Still, gas prices have increased by 8 cents over the past week. Lipow blamed two powerful forces: OPEC and Russia cutting production, and extreme heat. Since last fall, Saudi Arabia-led OPEC and Russia have announced plans to slash output by almost 5 million barrels per day through July, according to Lipow. Although OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, likely have not cut that full amount of output, whatever cuts they have implemented are starting to be felt in the market. US oil prices jumped 2.2% on Monday to close at $78.74 a barrel — the highest close since April 24. In the span of just six weeks, oil has climbed 17%. Extreme heat in the United States, Europe and elsewhere has also snarled some refinery operations, somewhat limiting the production of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Some refineries that want to run all-out to take advantage of high profit margins may not be able to. “Refineries, like humans, do not like it when the heat index is 115,” Lipow said. High heat in the Middle East is forcing Saudi Arabia and other countries to burn oil to power their electrical grids."

But they agreed these results are alarming and provide new evidence that the tipping point could occur sooner than previously thought. The AMOC is a complex tangle of currents that works like a giant global conveyor belt. It transports warm water from the tropics toward the North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southwards. It plays a crucial role in the climate system, helping regulate global weather patterns. Its collapse would have enormous implications, including much more extreme winters and sea level rises affecting parts of Europe and the US, and a shifting of the monsoon in the tropics. For years, scientists have been warning of its instability as the climate crisis accelerates, threatening to upset the balance of temperature and salinity on which the strength of these currents depend. As the oceans heat up and ice melts, more freshwater flows into the ocean and reduces the water’s density, making it less able to sink. When waters become too fresh, too warm or both, the conveyor belt stops. It has happened before. More than 12,000 years ago, rapid glacier melt caused the AMOC to shut down, leading to huge Northern Hemisphere temperature fluctuations of 10 to 15 degrees Celsius (18 to 27 Fahrenheit) within a decade. A shutdown “would affect every person on the planet – it’s that big and important,” said Peter de Menocal, the president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study. A 2019 report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that the AMOC would weaken over this century, but that its full collapse before 2100 was unlikely. This new study comes to a much more alarming conclusion. As the AMOC has only been continuously monitored since 2004, the study authors looked to a much larger dataset, and one which could show how the currents behaved in a period without human-caused climate change. “We needed to go back in time,” said Peter Ditlevsen, a professor of climate physics at the University of Copenhagen and one of the authors of the report. The scientists analyzed sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic in an area south of Greenland over a period of 150 years between 1870 and 2020. This part of the ocean is warmed by the water transported north from the tropics by the AMOC, Ditlevsen said, “so if it cools, it’s because the AMOC is weakening.” The authors then subtracted the impacts of human-caused global warming on the water temperature to understand how the currents were changing. They found “early warning signals” of critical changes in the AMOC, which led them to predict “with high confidence” that it could shut down or collapse as early as 2025 and no later than 2095. The likeliest point of collapse is somewhere between 2039 and 2070, Ditlevsen said. “It’s really scary,” he told CNN. “This is not something you would lightly put into papers,” he said, adding, “we’re very confident that this is a robust result.” De Menocal said the study results were “both surprising and alarming.” It’s been clear for a while that the AMOC will weaken in the coming decades, he told CNN. In 2021, a study found the AMOC was showing signs of instability due to climate change. But until now, we haven’t had a time frame. The new study “provides a novel analysis that focuses on when the AMOC tipping point will occur,” de Menocal said, and the study’s prediction the collapse will occur around 2050 “is alarmingly soon given the globally disruptive impact of such an event.” Although, he added, it is important to note that there is no observational evidence yet that the AMOC is collapsing. Stefan Rahmstorf, professor of physics of the oceans at the University of Potsdam in Germany, who was also not involved in the study, said the research helps bolster previous research. “There is still large uncertainty where the tipping point of the AMOC is, but the new study adds to the evidence that it is much closer than we thought just a few years ago,” he told CNN. “The scientific evidence now is that we can’t even rule out crossing a tipping point already in the next decade or two.” The report calls for fast and effective measures to cut planet-heating pollution to zero, to reduce global temperatures and slow melting in the Arctic. “The key point of this study is that we don’t have much time at all to do this,” de Menocal said. “And the stakes just got higher.”"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Extreme heat waves across three continents this month were made significantly more likely by the human-caused climate crisis, according to a new analysis released Tuesday as temperatures are still blazing in parts of the Northern Hemisphere. The “heat hell” searing parts of the United States and southern Europe would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change, while climate change made China’s heat wave at least 50 times more likely, according to a rapid attribution analysis from the World Weather Attribution initiative. The WWA, a group of international scientists who assess the role of climate change in extreme weather events, spent a week analyzing the dangerous heat waves that have swept the Northern Hemisphere in July, destroying crops and livestock, triggering wildfires, exacerbating water stress and killing people across three continents. Temperatures in Death Valley reached 128 degrees Fahrenheit (53.3 Celsius) this month and the city of Phoenix has experienced a record-smashing 25 consecutive days of temperatures hotter than 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius). China posted an all-time national high temperature at 52.2 degrees Celsius (126 Fahrenheit) earlier this month. And in Europe, local records were broken across parts of Spain and Italy as temperatures edged towards Europe’s all-time record of 48.8 degrees Celsius (119.8 Fahrenheit). To understand the extent to which the climate crisis affected the likelihood and intensity of this July’s extreme heat, the WWA team examined weather data and computer models to compare the world’s current climate – which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial era – with the climate of the past. They found that “the role of climate change is absolutely overwhelming,” said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London. If humans hadn’t heated the planet by burning oil, coal and gas, these kinds of blistering heat waves would be extremely rare, Otto told reporters on Monday. But, as the world continues to burn fossil fuels, they are no longer unusual, she said. In today’s climate, extreme heat waves like those the world is currently experiencing are expected once every 15 years for the US and Mexico, once every 10 years in Southern Europe and once every five years for China, the analysis found. The scientists found that climate change not only drastically increased the likelihood of these heat waves happening, but it is also making them hotter. Planet-heating pollution made Europe’s heat wave 2.5 degrees Celsius hotter, the North American heat wave 2 degrees Celsius hotter and China’s heatwave 1 degree Celsius hotter, according to the report. Worse could be in store. If the planet’s average temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, extreme heat waves can be expected every two to five years, according to the report. “It could well be that this is what will be a cool summer in the future, if we don’t stop burning fossil fuels rapidly,” Otto said. The scientists said that the developing El Niño, the natural climate pattern with a warming impact, likely helped push up temperatures a little – but that global warming from burning fossil fuels was the main reason the heatwaves are so severe. “The result of this attribution study is not surprising. The world hasn’t stopped burning fossil fuels, the climate continues to warm and heatwaves continue to become more extreme. It is that simple,” said Otto in a statement. But the study should not be interpreted as evidence of “runaway warming” or “climate collapse,” she added. “We still have time to secure a safe and healthy future, but we urgently need to stop burning fossil fuels and invest in decreasing vulnerability. If we do not, tens of thousands of people will keep dying from heat-related causes each year.” Heat waves are one of the deadliest natural hazards. More than 61,000 people died of heat-related deaths during Europe’s record-breaking heat wave last year, according to a recent  study. In Mexico, more than 100 people have died due to heat since March, while countries from the US to Italy have reported steep jumps in hospital admissions as people struggle to cope with soaring temperatures. Society must rapidly reduce planet-heating pollution, the report authors said. But they also called on countries and cities to adapt health, urban planning and energy systems, as well as accelerating the roll-out of heat action plans to better prepare for the extreme heat the climate crisis has already locked in. Richard Allan, professor in climate science at the University of Reading in the UK who was not involved in the study, said fluctuating weather patterns determined the location and timing of these heat waves. “But warming of the climate is promoting moderate heat waves to top off the league extremes and what would have been top of the league heat waves into events impossible in a climate without the heating effects of fossil fuel greenhouse gas emissions.”"

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","The record-shattering heat this summer has been downright dangerous in some of the largest cities in the US. But for some, the oppressive temperatures were likely far higher — even within the same city limits. A new analysis from Climate Central, a non-profit research group, found that urban development increased temperatures by at least 8 degrees Fahrenheit for a total of 41 million people who live in certain pockets of 44 US cities, making them much more vulnerable to higher cooling costs, heat-related illnesses, hospitalizations and even death. “Population density alone makes cities hotter than other environments, because so much of our everyday activities, including cooling our homes and workplaces, generate heat,” Jen Brady, a senior data analyst at Climate Central who designed and led the research, told CNN. “But even when cities and neighborhoods have similar population densities, development patterns and materials allow some to get much hotter than others.” Extreme heat has gripped the country’s southern tier from Southern California to Florida since June. And Phoenix, one of the hardest-hit cities in this summer’s scorching heat, is in its fourth week in a row of high temperatures over 110 degrees, smashing a previous record of 18 straight days. Phoenix is one of nine cities where at least 1 million people live in neighborhoods that climb 8 degrees higher than surrounding areas, the Climate Central analysis showed. More than 1.3 million residents in Phoenix are exposed to these higher temperatures. The analysis also found even more intense urban hotspots where temperatures are at least 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the rest of the city. Nearly 3.8 million New Yorkers, for example — 41% of the city’s population — faced temperatures at least 10 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the city’s official readings, Climate Central found. These giant swings in temperature over short distances in cities, known as the urban heat island effect, make heat waves even worse. Areas blanketed with asphalt, buildings, industry and freeways tend to absorb the sun’s energy then radiate more heat, while areas with abundant green space — parks, rivers, and tree-lined streets — radiate less heat and provide shade. For instance, only a few miles from Manhattan’s bustling Central Park, where luxury apartments, upscale shops, green spaces and trees neatly line the neighborhood streets and provide cooling for residents, Harlem experiences severe heat vulnerability due to nearby freeways and lack of green spaces. Urban heat islands can be deadly when temperatures spike. Extreme heat kills more Americans than any other weather-related disaster, according to data tracked by the National Weather Service — and climate change is making these extreme heat events more intense and frequent. “This analysis shows that planting rooftop gardens or trees at street level can make a difference, so can using lighter, more reflective surfaces for sidewalks and streets when it’s time to repave them,” Brady said. In Los Angeles, where much of the city’s land surface is heat-trapping black asphalt, and more than 3.2 million residents are exposed to the 8-degree temperature increase, city officials have installed California’s first white, reflective road coatings in some areas. In New York, an $106 million initiative aim to coat roofs with white reflective paint, while in Chicago, local green roof initiatives are taking place. “The way neighborhoods are built plays a huge role in how much additional summer heat their residents are exposed to, but many can be changed to reduce their urban heat island effect,” Brady said."

","Aya Elamroussi and Eric Zerkel, CNN","Dangerously high temperatures that have already proven deadly in multiple states are expanding as far east as the Northeast, as they also threaten ocean ecosystems and fuel destructive wildfires that emit harmful particulates. More than 100 million people from California to Massachusetts were under some kind of heat alert Wednesday as extreme temperatures spread across the country. Over the next seven days, 85% of the population will experience temperatures 90 degrees or higher. The southern tier of the US has been baking for weeks, with places like Phoenix, Miami and El Paso, Texas, continuing to smash record-long extreme-heat streaks Tuesday. Now it’s the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast’s turn. Temperatures are forecast to top 100 degrees in places like Kansas City and St. Louis through Friday. As the heat builds into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast by Thursday and Friday, highs in the upper 90’s could break daily records in places like Washington, DC, Philadelphia and New York. High humidity will drive up the heat index there to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The stifling forecast has pushed Connecticut’s governor to activate the state’s extreme hot weather protocol on Wednesday to provide cooling centers for vulnerable residents. “We’ve experienced a pretty warm summer so far, but it’s expected to get particularly hot this week, including during the evening hours,” Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said. And the heat has been affecting everyone: Last month was the hottest June on record dating back to 1850, according to a climate report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Globally, June 2023 set a record for the highest monthly sea surface temperature anomaly of any month in NOAA’s 174-year record,” the agency said.  “June heat was not limited to the ocean surface; the Southern Hemisphere had its warmest June on record and the Northern Hemisphere tied 2019 for its warmest June.” Scientists agree that human-induced climate change is the main culprit causing record high temperatures, which have led to hospitalizations and deaths in the US. Additionally, wildfires burning in Canada and US have been exacerbated by the unrelenting heat, tanking the air quality for many in both countries. The exceptional heat isn’t confined to land, either. Ocean temperatures around Florida are so high that experts reported severe coral bleaching and a die off at some reefs, which could worsen if the extreme warmth persists. And before temperatures begin to lessen in some places next week, here are some of the impacts it had on communities in recent weeks. Dozens of people across Arizona and Nevada have died this year from the physical impacts of extreme heat. In Arizona’s Maricopa County – home to Phoenix – 25 deaths have been reported to be heat-related so far this year as of Tuesday, the county said in a weekly report. Another 249 deaths are under investigation for whether heat was a cause. Meanwhile, Clark County in Nevada reported at least 16 heat-related deaths, the county’s coroner told CNN on Tuesday. Las Vegas, located in Clark County, experienced temperatures above 110 degrees for 10 consecutive days, the last of which was Monday. Extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the US, killing more people than hurricanes or tornadoes. And it also leads to illnesses. Last week, at least 570 hospital visits in Arizona were related to heat-related complications, the state department of health services said. “Fire departments and Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers have reported treating an increasing number of patients for heat-related illness too. These incidents are only the tip of the iceberg. We urge Arizonans to take this extreme heat extremely seriously,” the department said in a statement Tuesday. Making matters worse, five people are suspected to have died since June 1 from heat-related causes in national parks – more than an average entire year, park service news releases and preliminary National Park Service data provided to CNN show. No other year had five heat-related deaths by July 23, according to park mortality data dating to 2007. A wildfire in southern Oregon fueled by the heat and strong winds destroyed dozens of homes and outbuildings and also knocked out internet and 911 services in one county. The so-called Golden Fire burned through 43 homes and 43 outbuildings as it grew to more than 2,000 acres around 11 miles north of Bonanza, Oregon, since July 22. The fire also knocked down more than 100 power poles, blacking out internet and 911 services in Lake County, Oregon, according to a news release from the Lake County Sheriff’s Office. Nearby Klamath County, Oregon, was handling 911 calls in the meantime. The fire was one of several also degrading air quality across the country. As of Tuesday, there were nine wildfires in each of Arizona and New Mexico, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Also, smoke from hundreds of wildfires burning across Canada continued to waft south, tanking air quality and polluting air in Chicago and Detroit. Both cities were among the 10 top cities with the worst air quality in the world, according to IQAir, with Chicago ranking fifth and Detroit ninth as of early Wednesday morning. “Today, air quality in the City of Detroit will be Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (AQI Orange) range,” the Detroit health department said Tuesday. “The air quality is being impacted by the presence of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5).” In addition to the poor air quality, Detroit is also facing extreme heat this week, when some areas are expected to feel as hot as 99 degrees Thursday and Friday, according to the city’s National Weather Service. “Very hot and muggy conditions are likely later this week with heat index values approaching 100 degrees,” the weather service said on Twitter. The consequences of dangerously high temperatures have stretched beyond land. The record-breaking heatwave led to surging water temperatures off Florida’s coast, where multiple reefs around the Keys area are currently completely bleached or dead. The mass bleaching event unfolded in two weeks, according to coral experts, who said they expect the “complete mortality” of the bleached reefs in just a week. Because it is extremely sensitive to temperature changes, experiencing too much heat for too long causes coral to bleach and turn white as they expel their algal food source and slowly starve to death. The water is typically in mid-80s in the region, but experts have recorded 90-degree temperatures, according to Cynthia Lewis, who heads the Keys Marine Laboratory at the Florida Institute of Oceanography. “It is very alarming,” she said in a news release. Teams from the University of South Florida and the Florida Institute of Oceanography Keys Marine Laboratory conducted a rescue mission for more than 1,500 corals by harvesting them from at risk sites and bringing them into a temperature controlled laboratory. Sweltering temperatures are also posing a risk to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current, a vital system of ocean currents which includes the Gulf Stream. A study published Tuesday in the journal Nature found the current may collapse around the middle of the century or as early as 2025. The AMOC is a complex tangle of currents that works like a giant global conveyor belt. It transports warm water from the tropics toward the North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southwards. It plays a crucial role in the climate system, helping regulate global weather patterns. Its collapse would have significant implications, including much more extreme winters and sea level rises affecting parts of Europe and the US as well as a shifting of the monsoon in the tropics. Scientists uninvolved with the study told CNN the exact tipping point for the critical system is uncertain, and that measurements of the currents have so far showed little trend or change. But they agreed these results are alarming and provide new evidence that the tipping point could occur sooner than previously thought. CNN’s Laura Paddison, Robert Shackleford, Monica Garrett, Jamiel Lynch, Sara Smart, Joe Sutton, Dave Alsup and Michelle Watson contributed to this report."

Pump prices have now jumped by roughly 12 cents in the span of just three days. Gas prices remain well below the painful levels of last year. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the spike in oil prices, gas prices hit a record of $5.02 a gallon in June 2022. Still, there has been a significant shift higher in recent days after a long period of stable prices. According to AAA, gas is now selling at an average of $3.80 or above in thirteen states, including Pennsylvania, Colorado, Illinois, Nevada and Arizona. California and Washington are just cents away from the $5 mark. The sudden spike is being driven in part by a jump in oil prices, which are sitting at three-month highs as recession fears fade and OPEC cuts production. Saudi Arabia and Russia are intentionally holding back supply in a bid to lift prices – and that strategy is starting to work. Another significant problem: Some refineries, including at least one ExxonMobil facility, had to undergo unscheduled maintenance in recent days. Analysts say extreme heat is sidelining some refinery activity, limiting supply of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The timing is terrible for drivers, because demand is high right now amid the summer travel season. Gasoline inventories are sitting at their lowest level for July since 2015, according to GasBuddy. Bank of America on Wednesday warned the oil market will move into a supply deficit of about 1.1 million barrels per day during the second half of this year. That’s why the bank continues to expect Brent oil, the world benchmark, to average $90 a barrel next year, up from $83 today. The jump in gasoline prices, if sustained, could complicate matters for the economy by undoing progress on the inflation front and eroding rebounding consumer confidence."

",Opinion by Bill McGuire,"Editor’s Note: Bill McGuire is Professor Emeritus of Geophysical & Climate Hazards at University College London and author of “Hothouse Earth: An Inhabitant’s Guide.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN opinion here. Terrified tourists holidaying in the Greek Islands this week came face-to-face with the future. As wildfires, driven by record-breaking heat, tinder-box conditions and strong winds, raged across the islands of Rhodes, Corfu and Evia, thousands of visitors, along with residents, had to flee the flames — many with just the clothes they were wearing. It would be a big mistake to regard these as freak events and to continue holidaying as usual in the years ahead. On the contrary, the extreme weather conditions across southern Europe this summer are a wake-up call — a reminder that not even our vacations are insulated from the growing consequences of global heating. This view is reinforced by a new study published earlier this week which showed that both the European and North American heatwaves would have been all but impossible without climate change. The plague of heat and fires that our world is experiencing today is one consequence of a 1.2 degrees Celsius hike in the global average temperature, compared to pre-industrial times. A 2 degrees Celsius rise, which we are currently on target to far exceed by the end of the century, would see the average number of heatwave days increase six-fold across southern Europe — so that 1 in 100-year heatwaves would happen every other year. Even northern Europe would see a tripling of extreme heat events, which could be expected once every five years. The reality is that the ongoing heatwaves and wildfires provide us with glimpses of worse to come in the decades ahead as our planet gets ever hotter — but this is not a natural progression, it is a direct result of humankind’s carbon-polluting activities. Actions have consequences. And a straight line can be drawn from the huge volumes of carbon dioxide pumped out as millions fly off on a summer holiday every year, to the heat, fires and other episodes of extreme weather that now endanger both resorts and those who visit them. The events of the last week in the Greek Islands should, then, give us pause for thought, not only about whether we should any longer be flying on holiday to places that may threaten us and our loved ones — but about the whole point of having a holiday. For many of us, jetting off every year on a foreign break has almost become instinctive — just something we do without really thinking about it. If southern Europe is out of bounds due to increasing heat, then the tendency for many will be to find somewhere else that looks — on the face of it at least — less risky. But this isn’t the answer. Climate breakdown is set to become all-pervasive and affect every aspect of our lives and livelihoods, and already extreme weather can happen pretty much anywhere. So, what to do? Last year, UK residents made more than 46 million trips to go on holiday abroad. This can’t go on, nor should it, both for the peace of mind of holiday-makers increasingly worried about growing extreme weather, and for the good of the planet. Vacations need to return to their roots, or at least move in that direction. In particular, holidays abroad need to be decoupled from flying, which means — as far as Europe is concerned — train, car or coach. There are issues, of course. A just-published Greenpeace analysis revealed that travelling by train around Europe is, on average, four times more expensive than flying. Travelling by road takes longer, and is likely to involve hours of frustrating queueing at ports. But on the plus side, the journey itself becomes part of the holiday. Airport scrums and delays are avoided and, most importantly for the climate, carbon emissions are massively reduced. In any case, the aviation sector is not getting off scot-free as temperatures climb, and delays and cancellations are set to become far more common. As I write this, both Palermo and Catania airports in Sicily are closed because of wildfires. In the US, the impact of extreme heat on aircraft engines, and on the lift the wings provide during take-off, means that planes are having to reduce weight by shedding fuel load, passengers or baggage or wait for temperatures to fall. Perhaps the solution is to focus on what we really want and need from a holiday — a period of well-earned rest and recuperation that recharges the batteries and sets us up for the next round of the daily grind. We should ask ourselves if we have to experience the exotic and the unfamiliar to accomplish this — especially when an increased risk to life and limb attaches to holidays in distant lands — or if we can get it closer to home. Maybe we should take a lesson from the pandemic, when staycations were pretty much enforced. There is so much to marvel at in our own countries, even though its climate is also changing. The UK, where I live, is far from immune to the wild weather that global heating is driving, as the over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) temperatures and destructive wildfires of last year testify, and severe heatwaves will become more commonplace. If you like the heat, increasingly you won’t need to travel, it will find you. Nonetheless, the familiarity and convenience of being close to home can bring its own contentment, comfort and well-being. What’s more, we’ll be able sunbathe in the warm glow of knowing we have slashed the size of our carbon footprint — making us part of the solution rather than the problem."

View more opinion on CNN. Summer heat is breaking records across the US. More than 2,300 heat records have already been broken, with cities like Phoenix and Dallas hitting triple-digit temperatures. These numbers should not be shocking — if anything, they fit a long-term pattern of record-breaking temperatures due to climate change. According to NASA, the past nine years have been the warmest on record. The cost of electricity to stay cool during the summer is also increasing, as families run their air conditioning systems longer to keep their homes at a safe and comfortable temperature. We estimate that the cost of home energy nationally will increase by 11.7% this summer to an average of $578, up from $517 last summer. And these numbers follow the high cost of heating last winter, putting an enormous financial burden on low-income families. Indeed, these families are already behind on their home energy bills. Close to 20 million families owe about $19.5 billion on their utility bills. Federal funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides formula grants to states to help pay household heating and cooling bills, is only adequate to help about one out of six eligible households, while just 20% of program funds are used for cooling (the other 80% is used for heating). And rising temperatures present a public health issue, too, as emergency room visits increase from people suffering from heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion, which can lead to heat stroke. Emissions also increase as families use more electricity to run their air conditioning systems and utilities use more fossil fuels to produce the electricity needed to run those systems. It’s clear that we need to act now to develop a nationwide framework for climate adaptation to protect all vulnerable families from hotter summers, higher bills and more extreme weather events. About 34.2 million households are currently income eligible to receive energy bill assistance under the current LIHEAP legislation — according to federal law, households with incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty level, currently $30,000 for a family of four, or 60% of state median income, whichever is greater, are eligible for the program. And while the Inflation Reduction Act provides $4.5 billion for low-income energy efficiency retrofits and a maximum of $14,000 per household, it’s only enough funding to upgrade about 320,000 households — just 1% of the families that will need help. States have been taking matters into their own hands, creating clean energy plans that include statewide greenhouse gas reduction goals. But not all state climate plans include specific policies focusing on low-income families. This piecemeal approach has the potential to create an alarming level of climate inequity, including energy affordability, access to energy efficiency equipment to help transition to rising temperatures and health concerns based on the state in which someone lives. Lack of access to cooling could mean death from heat-related illness. To address the summer cooling crisis, there are a few things the government can do in the short term: Utilities should voluntarily suspend shutoffs this summer for families who are behind on their bills. Maricopa Country, Arizona, for example, has seen at least 18 deaths from heat-related illnesses, while 69 more are under investigation for being heat-related. Only 19 states, including Arizona, plus Washington, DC, have summer shut-off protections in place, and many of those are limited to periods of extreme temperature. Meanwhile, 42 states plus Washington, DC have winter shutoff protections in place. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association is asking Congress for an additional $3 billion for cooling assistance this year. These additional funds will help six million households pay their cooling bills this summer. Many low-income families have access to cooling — they just can’t afford to turn it on. Long-term, the nation must develop a strategy to help retrofit the entire low-income housing stock by helping families pay for high-efficiency retrofits that will reduce their energy costs and make their houses more resilient to climate change. The strategy should have a goal of retrofitting the entire low-income housing stock within the next 10 years and set appropriations to address the full need. Utilities and residential building owners nationwide should be required to protect low-income families during periods of extreme weather. This includes year-round shutoff protection for medically vulnerable households and for all households during extreme weather. It also includes requiring the multi-family building owners to provide access to cooling, the same way they provide access to heating. We can no longer afford to think about energy assistance as a seasonal need. Extreme hot and cold temperatures and extreme weather events are impacting families across the country in all months of the year. We should better prepare for these crises and develop programs that help low-income families stay safe and in their homes."

I want the American people to know: Help is here and we’re going to make it available to anyone who needs it,” Biden said Thursday, calling on Americans to listen to public officials, stay indoors if vulnerable, know the signs of heat stroke, be careful on hot pavement, “always have a bottle of water” and take advantage of cooling centers. Around 150 million people from coast to coast are under heat alerts Thursday after extreme heat expanded into the highly populated I-95 corridor, bringing the highest temperatures of the year there. The heat also won’t let up in the South and Southwest, where heat-related deaths are climbing, emergency rooms are filling with heat-related burn victims and even animals are falling victim to heat illness. Heat indexes – a measure of what the temperature feels like when accounting for relative humidity – are expected to top 100 degrees Fahrenheit across many areas in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Friday. Biden announced that he’s asked acting Labor Secretary Julie Su to issue a “heat hazard alert” clarifying protections for workers. “We should be protecting workers from hazardous conditions, and we will. And those states where they do not, I’m going to be calling them out,” he warned. Su, he said, will also work with her team, to “intensify enforcement, increasing inspection in high-risk industries like construction and agriculture.” The US Forest Service is awarding more than $1 billion in grants for the planting of trees that is aimed at helping to bring down temperatures in the long term. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, he added, is providing “billions” to make buildings more efficient and more heat-resistant, as well as for the opening of cooling centers. The Department of Interior, he said, is using infrastructure funding to expand water storage capacity to deal with future droughts. And NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is partnering with universities and impacted communities “to improve the nation’s weather forecasts and its accuracy.” Biden pressed the importance of the local officials on the “front lines.” Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego and San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg both participated in the conversation virtually, sharing their perspectives in dealing the extreme heat challenges. The president also spoke more broadly about the impact of heat and climate change. “I don’t think anybody can deny the impact of climate change anymore… I don’t know anybody who honestly believes climate change is not a serious problem,” he said, pointing to droughts, hurricanes, wildfires and record temperatures. Phoenix, he noted, has had temperatures over 110 degrees for 27 straight days, and he referenced ocean temperatures near Miami “like a hot tub” topping 100 degrees. Heat, Biden said, has been “the number one weather-related killer,” with 600 people dying annually from its effects, “more than from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes in America combined.” He told the story of an elderly woman in Phoenix who fell out of her wheelchair and had third-degree burns after five minutes on the hot ground, and noted farm workers and firefighters and construction workers who “risk their lives” working in extreme heat. “Folks, we really want to pretend these things are normal? Experts say extreme heat is already costing America $100 billion a year and hits our most vulnerable the hardest: seniors, people experiencing homelessness who have nowhere to turn, disadvantaged communities. … And it’s threatening farms, fisheries, forests that so many families depend on to make a living.” He also went after “MAGA extremists” in Congress, who, he said, are trying to repeal legislative progress. And he called on Americans to visit heat.gov, a national integrated heat health information system."

This building has a sustainable solution,07-27-2023,"                                                 In mid-July at the construction site at 1 Java Street in Brooklyn, New York, the outside temperatures can reach sweltering highs in the 90s. But 500-feet underground, it’s 55 degrees all year round.                                             ","Clare Duffy, CNN Video by John General, Deborah Brunswick and Hazel Tang, CNN","In mid-July at the construction site at 1 Java Street in Brooklyn, New York, the outside temperatures can reach sweltering highs in the 90s. But 500-feet underground, it’s 55 degrees all year round. That stable, underground temperature will be key to making life comfortable in the residential building that will soon sit on the site, a scenic spot in the Greenpoint neighborhood along Brooklyn’s waterfront. With 834 rental apartments plus commercial space, 1 Java Street is set to be the largest multifamily, residential building with “geothermal” heating and cooling system in New York State — and potentially the country — when it’s completed in late 2025, according to developer Lendlease. Geothermal technology is essentially a more eco-friendly version of an HVAC system, allowing the building spaces and water to be cooled and heated more efficiently, without traditional window AC units and natural gas. Lendlease says the technology will make it possible for the nearly 790,000-square foot building to release around 55% less carbon and achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions. With summer temperatures reaching record highs around the world, experts say finding ways to cool buildings that are less taxing on the environment could be crucial in fighting climate change. Even back in 2018, air conditioning and electric fans accounted for around 20% of total global electricity use, according to a report cpublished that year by the International Energy Agency. Now, energy and urban development experts are urging cities and developers to implement new solutions to keep buildings cooler. And both New York City and the Biden administration have identified geothermal systems as one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “Whenever we look at a site, we consider how we can make it more sustainable,” Layth Madi, Lendlease’s senior vice president and director of development, told CNN, adding that the development firm is aiming to reach net zero by 2025 and be fully decarbonized by 2040. “I think many residents will choose to live in this building because of its green credentials,” Madi said. “We know a lot of people are thinking about climate change and our impact on the planet.” Geothermal plumbing works by sending water from a building deep into the ground below it to take advantage of the earth’s naturally stable internal temperature — on hot days, the underground temperature will reduce the temperature of warm water from the building to help with cooling; on cold days, it will warm up cold water to help with heating. At 1 Java Street, construction crews are drilling 320 holes, each around 4 inches in diameter and 499-feet deep, to create the building’s geothermal piping system through which the water will be pumped. “Your thermostat turns on and it tells your building, ‘I need heating or cooling.’ And it energizes pumps, and those pumps flow fluid through the [geothermal] circuit that we’ve established here on site,” said Adam Alaica, director of engineering and development at Geosource Energy, the Canadian firm that’s installing and drilling the vertical geothermal piping at 1 Java Street. For now, the process doesn’t come cheap. Installing the building’s geothermal system increased construction costs by around 6%, according to Madi, and required securing equipment and trained manpower that remains relatively scarce. “We’re seeing rapid growth — I would say approaching that of exponential growth year over year in interest in the technology, which is very exciting for the industry as a whole,” Alacia said. “The bottlenecks to that growth have always been, and will continue to be in the years to come, specialty machinery to implement this infrastructure and the people resources it takes to do this.” Eventually, though, as more developers invest in geothermal and more companies provide the specialty training needed to install the technology — Geosource operates its own training program — Madi said he expects the costs to come down. And once the building is up and running, it should be more cost efficient to heat and cool. Lendlease didn’t specify whether residents of 1 Java Street will experience any cost savings on utilities thanks to the geothermal system (the units themselves will be priced at market rate, with 30% of them set aside as affordable housing). “Ultimately, it will be up to tenants to manage their power consumption and work with the utility company on billing,” the company told CNN. While 1 Java Street will be one of relatively few geothermal buildings in the state, the companies behind its development say New York — and the world — could use more buildings like it. “Geothermal is not a new technology … there’s kind of a primitive component to it, using the earth as a heat source and heat sink,” Alacia said. “In general, geothermal can really be used anywhere you have ground under your feet … The cost and the business case can vary, but technically it has strong credentials really anywhere in the country.”"

But the temperature for the first 23 days of July averaged 16.95 degrees Celsius (62.51 Fahrenheit), well above the previous record of 16.63 degrees Celsius (61.93 Fahrenheit) set in July 2019, according to the report. The data used to track these records goes back to 1940, but many scientists – including those at Copernicus – say it’s almost certain that these temperatures are the warmest the planet has seen in 120,000 years, given what we know from millennia of climate data extracted from tree rings, coral reefs and deep sea sediment cores. “These are the hottest temperatures in human history,” said Samantha Burgess, deputy director at Copernicus. It all adds up to a blistering Northern Hemisphere summer – potentially an unprecedented one. “The odds are certainly in a favor of a record-breaking summer,” said Carlo Buontempo, the director of Copernicus, although he cautioned that it’s too early to state that with confidence. The human toll of the heat is stark. As temperatures have risen above 120 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) in parts of the US, heat-related deaths have mounted and people are suffering life-threatening burns from falling onto scorching hot ground. In the Mediterranean, more than 40 people have died as wildfires rage across the region, fueled by high temperatures. In Asia, prolonged, intense heat waves are claiming lives and threatening food security. Human-caused climate change is the main driver of this extraordinary heat, Burgess said. “The global air temperature is directly proportional to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.” A recent study found that climate change played an “absolutely overwhelming” role in the heat waves in the US, China and southern Europe this summer. The arrival of El Niño, a natural climate fluctuation with a warming impact, has not had a huge impact on the temperatures as it is still in its developmental phase, Burgess said, but it will play much more of a role next year, she added, and will likely drive temperatures even higher. The news that July will be the hottest month comes amid a slew of alarming records that have already been broken – and then broken again – this summer. Last month was the hottest June on record by a “substantial margin,” according to Copernicus. Then in July, the world experienced its hottest day on record. On July 6, the global average temperature rose to 17.08 degrees Celsius (62.74 Fahrenheit), according to Copernicus data, beating the previous temperature record of 16.8 degrees Celsius (62.24 Fahrenheit) set in August 2016. Every day since July 3 has been hotter than the 2016 record. “We are seven months into 2023 and almost every month this year has been in the top five hottest on record,” said Burgess, adding that if the trends continue into the fall and winter, 2023 is likely to be among the warmest years ever recorded. Ocean heat is also at record levels. In mid-May, global ocean surface temperatures reached “unprecedented levels” for the time of year. “What we’re seeing right now, we’ve not seen before,” said Burgess. Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved in the report, called the new July temperature record “eye-popping,” but warned that it will be broken again. “It is scary to remember that in another decade, this will be viewed as a relatively cool year, most likely,” she said, adding, “if people don’t like what they’re seeing this summer, they will be in for quite a shock at the higher warming levels we’re heading for.” Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the WMO, said July’s extreme weather reveals “the harsh reality of climate change.” “The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is more urgent than ever before” he said in a statement. “Climate action is not a luxury but a must.”"

In Arizona, the Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office in Phoenix brought in 10 refrigerated containers to handle a possible overflow of heat-related deaths. The containers haven’t been needed yet, but the office is over its normal capacity of 224 bodies during a July that has “been worse than prior years,” Maricopa County spokesperson Jason Berry told CNN affiliate KTVK/KPHO. The county has reported 25 heat-associated deaths so far this year as of Monday, with dozens of other deaths still under investigation for a potential link to heat. “While we typically see a surge in heat-related deaths in July, we won’t know how many … we have this year until forensic pathologists complete their investigations,” Maricopa County spokesperson Jessie Caraveoa told CNN. Arizona officials are also reporting emergency room visits for extreme heat burns after people fall to the ground, and even cactuses are wilting and dying from the persistent triple-digit temperatures. Animals are also suffering. Twenty-one dogs were rescued from high heat in a garage and a concrete shed-like structure on the premises of a home “unfit for human or animal lodging” in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, the Lawrence County Sheriff said. Temperatures in the area were in the 90s and the dogs had no food or water. The dogs were all removed from the property and are being treated, some for “physical injuries.” More than 150 million people from Southern California to New England were facing dangerous heat on Friday for the second consecutive day after it expanded north and east. Record-high temperatures were reported on Thursday in Arizona, California, Texas, Louisiana and Washington, DC. In El Paso, Texas, temperatures hit 104 degrees on Friday, bringing the total number of consecutive days above 100 to 43, but the city is expected to have some relief on Sunday when the high temperature could stay below 100. Heat indexes – a measure of what the temperature feels like on the skin when accounting for relative humidity – reached between 105 and 110 degrees on Friday in Washington, DC, Chicago and St. Louis. Overnight temperatures won’t dip below the 80s in places like St Louis and Kansas City – a particularly dangerous forecast since nighttime heat limits the opportunity for the body to cool off and protect itself from heat illness. Here’s how some communities have taken heat precautions to try to keep people safe: The heat is also taxing power infrastructure in many parts of the country. Energy provider Con Edison has asked New York residents to reduce their consumption. “Intense heat and increased demand for air conditioning can cause strain on the electric system and may lead to localized outages,” the utility said in a news release. And PJM Interconnection – the nation’s largest power grid system – on Thursday declared an emergency alert, which instructs all systems to be online, including those with planned outages. The utility coordinates electricity for more than 65 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, DC, according to its website. After reaching a high of 93 degrees on Friday, Chicago’s residents are expected to see cooler temperatures on Saturday when a downright cool high of around 80 degrees is forecast. That relief will spread to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast by Sunday as a cold front arrives, including in New York where a high in the low 80s is forecast on Sunday and Washington, DC, where the heat index will exceed 100 degrees on Saturday before highs drop back into the upper 80s by Sunday. Relatively cooler temperatures are finally headed to Phoenix, too. Phoenix hit a preliminary high temperature of 113 degrees on Friday, marking the 29th day the city has recorded temperatures above 110 degrees – a trend that is forecast continue into the weekend before the streak could finally end by Sunday or Monday. Unfortunately, the heat won’t disappear entirely in the country. Several locations along the Gulf Coast and in Texas, including New Orleans, Houston and Dallas could threaten record high temperatures on Monday and Tuesday. CNN’s Robert Shackelford, Rebekah Riess, Michelle Watson, Jared Formanek, Eli Masket, Sarah Dewberry, Maria Sole Campinoti and Macie Goldfarb contributed to this report."

But if you work in an office, chances are the temperatures indoors felt the exact opposite. The short-sleeved shirt you were sweating in on the commute could have you searching for blankets and googling ‘space heaters for sale’ by lunch. Although the heat outside is setting records, the summer cold front in the office is not a new phenomenon. When air conditioning became standard in buildings in the 1950s, offices started “overcooling,” explains Salvatore Basile, the author of “Cool: How Air Conditioning Changed Everything.” Building owners wanted to show they offered the comfort of air conditioning, but sometimes they offered too much of it. “One building exhibitor published an advertisement stating that people got sick after spending time in his air conditioning,” said Basile, “just to prove how cold his building was.” But why is the office still so cold today? Experts have various answers: different bodies, and sometimes, genders, react to temperatures differently; the temperature model used is decades old; and office air-conditioning is designed for a more formal dress code. Then there’s the belief chilly people might just get more work done. Mark Zuckerberg famously kept Facebook, now Meta, at an uncomfortable 59 degrees to boost productivity, former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg noted in her 2013 book, “Lean In.” Architects and engineers explain air flow in buildings is designed for full occupancy. Few offices are currently reaching those levels as many employees work from home at least part of the workweek. Buildings are also already designed to withstand the hottest day and don’t necessarily scale back for an average summer one. “It is like having a car with a NASCAR engine, but you just need to go to Trader Joe’s to get some bread,” says David Lehrer, architect and communications director at UC Berkeley’s Center for the Built Environment. This is compounded by the fact the current model used for calculating the temperature in offices is decades old and incorrect, said Ruiji Sun, a researcher at the Center. The main issue with the model, Sun says, is it incorrectly assumes human beings have the same response to a certain temperature. Women, at least anecdotally, feel the chill more. Some have taken to social media to air their temperature grievances, often with the hashtag “Women’s Winter.” Pittsburgh newscaster Heather Abraham posted a video of the women in her office wearing blankets and sweaters earlier this summer. “It was so funny because when Heather’s video came up on my feed, I had my space heater on and it was June,” said Leann Parrish, a TikTok creator who made a similar post voicing her frustrations with office temperatures. Way back in 2016, a CollegeHumor sketch on YouTube poked fun at this phenomenon. Women in the office had icicles hanging from their eyebrows, while men were lathering on sunblock. “Rarely do I hear a guy clutch their arms and shiver and say, ‘Am I the only one who’s cold in here?’ Usually it’s a woman,” said the sketch writer, Kassia Miller, who has since become a television screenwriter on such shows as “The Good Place.” The term “Women’s Winter” raises the question, why do women seem to feel the office cold front more than men? “Air conditioning was a sexist technology. It tended to favor men,” said Basile. “This was possibly due to biology and possibly due to men’s clothing,” which used to be suits and ties in the office. Scientists have studied this phenomenon – but there’s wide disagreement. “Differences in reactions to temperatures can be explained by body size, body composition, clothing and activity level,” Boris Kingma, a senior biophysics researcher at the Netherlands Institute of Applied Scientific Research, said. According to a 2015 paper by Kingma, temperatures in office buildings appear to be based on the heat needs of a 40-year-old, 154-pound man. Kingma said there is no conclusive evidence different genders are wired to react to the same temperature differently. Gender-based corporate clothing norms play much more of a role. Luckily there are ways around this, he said, such as allowing employees to wear shorts. Japan has already jumped on this with their ‘Cool Biz’ campaign, which allows employees to wear lighter clothing to work from the months of May to September, Kingma said. Inside, buildings are set to 82 degrees Fahrenheit to conserve energy. In addition to allowing lighter clothing in the office, another option is allowing fans, said Stefano Schiavon, a professor at UC Berkeley. “Start by raising the office temperature 5 degrees, and then give people the option to use fans, either at their desk or installed into the ceiling,” says Schiavon. Those who are comfortable in the warmer temperatures can leave their fans off, and those who are not can turn on the fans. Still uncomfortable? Request a seat change. Seats closest to the windows will be the warmest, Kingma said, while those under vents in the center of the office will offer a cool alternative.” The key is allowing people to adjust, whether that be their clothes or the air.”"

Wolf, CNN","A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Here’s a hot take on the summer of 2023: The climate you grew up in is gone, replaced by something new and changing, but also inalterably different – where the Atlantic Ocean can reach hot-tub temperature, heat is a recurring public health concern and people will have to adapt their way of living. In this year of epic heat, it’s time to start thinking about how the climate changed rather than the fact of its changing. From a historical standpoint, we are in uncharted territory. This is not just the hottest month in human history. It may be the hottest month in 120,000 years, according to scientists in Europe. Nearly half the US is under a heat advisory this week, and the country’s largest power grid was on alert. The warnings that more fires, floods and storms would occur as the atmosphere heated up are here. A large portion of the country has seen smoke come and go from those Canadian wildfires. Tourists in Greece were forced to flee in the country’s largest-ever evacuation. Towns unused to flooding were under water this year in Vermont. Torrential rain flooded Boston’s Fenway park. The West Coast of the US, for instance, has gotten a respite so far from wildfires thanks to epic rainfall earlier in the year. But we can expect more heat more often. Asked by CNN’s Zain Asher about a heat index in Iran that approached 150 degrees Fahrenheit, Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, said to prepare for more. “What we know is the heat will become much more intense, much more frequent, and that if we don’t act urgently to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, then the outlook will be very serious with, as you said, temperatures that are beyond the limits of physiological survival.” Are we acting urgently? Asher pointed out California is phasing out gas-powered car sales. Romanello said the basic move would be to commit to phase out fossil fuels. But countries are not yet on that path or anywhere close to it. Take a look at Arizona, where Phoenix has endured nearly a full straight month of 110-plus-degree days. Cacti can’t stand the heat and are dying. Hospitals have been taxed. Doctors are treating people burned just by falling on the ground, according to one CNN report. The Phoenix area medical examiner has brought in extra refrigerated containers for bodies, like it did during spikes of Covid-19, to deal with potential overflow. Maricopa County has 25 heat-related deaths so far, but another 249 are under investigation. The urban density that creates economic opportunity also makes cities hotter than their surrounding areas. There can be variation up to 8 degrees between portions of a city with trees and green space and those that are mostly pavement. “These giant swings in temperature over short distances in cities, known as the urban heat island effect, make heat waves even worse,” writes CNN’s Rachel Ramirez of a new report by the nonprofit research group Climate Central. “Areas blanketed with asphalt, buildings, industry and freeways tend to absorb the sun’s energy then radiate more heat, while areas with abundant green space – parks, rivers, and tree-lined streets – radiate less heat and provide shade.” Ramirez notes that cities are looking for new ways to adapt, like painting roads white in Los Angeles, painting roofs in New York and more. Coral reefs off the Florida Keys, unable to stand the 100-plus-degree temperatures charted in some areas, are suffering a mass bleaching event, according to CNN’s Eric Zerkel, who writes experts were stunned at the two-week escalation that could kill some reefs off. That’s a very real and grim consequence. More theoretical is the possibility that the series of currents that circulates water around the oceans simply collapses. A study published in the journal Nature this week suggested the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current, which includes the Gulf Stream, could collapse as early as 2025. Melting ice could dilute ocean water and alter the currents, which would affect everyone on the planet. The reason gas prices have spiked in recent days? On top of OPEC holding back supply, excessive heat is affecting productivity at oil refineries. In the US, while President Joe Biden has made pledges to make the US carbon neutral in the coming decades, he is not completely opposed to new oil projects. It was seen as a political win for him and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, that the Supreme Court cleared the way Thursday for a new pipeline running through West Virginia. That news came the same day the White House announced new relief measures for people suffering from the record heat, including the creation of a new “heat hazard alert” system to clarify precautions for workers. “I don’t think anybody can deny the impact of climate change anymore,” Biden said, announcing the measures. A majority of Americans – 52% – said in Gallup survey in March, before this heat wave, that protecting the environment should be prioritized even if it hurts the economy. That’s compared with 43% who said the government should prioritize economic growth even if it hurts the environment. However. The numbers may fluctuate depending on how people feel about the health of the economy. But the share who prioritize economic growth over the environment has on the whole risen in Gallup’s polling over the long term. Between 1985 and 2002, that number never topped 40%. The partisan divide over climate change is also the largest it has ever been. The geophysicist Bill McGuire, a professor at University College London and author of “Hothouse Earth: An Inhabitant’s Guide,” writes for CNN Opinion this week that people’s vacations as we know them are over. He points to tourists who had to flee the island of Rhodes in Greece to get away from wildfires. “It would be a big mistake to regard these as freak events and to continue holidaying as usual in the years ahead,” McGuire writes. “On the contrary, the extreme weather conditions across southern Europe this summer are a wake-up call – a reminder that not even our vacations are insulated from the growing consequences of global heating.”"

However, most of the alerts are expected to expire Saturday night. During the day, though, temperatures will not let up. “Many places are set to break their temperature records for daytime highs as well as warm nighttime lows through Saturday morning,” the National Weather Service said, adding that some areas in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic can expect their highest temperatures so far this year. The dangerously high temperatures have proven deadly in Arizona, Illinois and Texas as the expansive heat wave spread across much of the country, with humidity also playing a role in exacerbating the physical impacts on humans, animals and plants. Experts agree that human-induced climate change is a main factor leading to record high temperatures, and scientists say July will be the planet’s hottest month on record. Heat indexes – a measure of what the temperature feels like on the skin when accounting for relative humidity – are expected to hover around 100 and 110 degrees Saturday over parts of the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast. But relief is on the way for some: On Sunday, a cold front will progress through the mid-Atlantic, ultimately ending the heat wave for much of the East Coast. Meanwhile, the Southwest is expected to remain in a heat wave for several days before some ease sets in. Phoenix may end its dayslong streak of highs above 110 degrees on Sunday, while Las Vegas is expected to see highs exceeding 100 degrees into early next week. Another heat wave is expected to build early next week across the South and Gulf Coast. Here’s how the heat has been impacting communities across the country: • Heat-related deaths rise in US: In Illinois, a 53-year-old woman died Thursday in her Peoria apartment, which didn’t have air conditioning because power had been disconnected there, the Peoria County coroner’s office said. She died from “an exacerbation of her chronic medical conditions due to the excessive heat in the apartment,” the coroner’s office said. In Texas, a 66-year-old woman died early Tuesday from the extreme heat after being taken to a hospital from her apartment in North Richland Hills, police said. • Arizona county prepares for overflow of deaths: Arizona’s Maricopa County has added 10 refrigerated containers to handle a possible overflow of heat-related deaths. The containers haven’t been needed yet, but the medical examiner’s office is over its normal capacity, a county spokesperson told CNN affiliate KTVK/KPHO. The county, home to the state’s most populous city, Phoenix, had already reported 25 heat-associated deaths so far this year as of Monday. Dozens of other deaths were under investigation for a potential link to heat. • Heat alerts: Washington, DC, and parts of Maryland and Virginia along with St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, are under an excessive heat warning Saturday. Philadelphia, New York City, and Newark, New Jersey, are under heat advisories. The extreme heat has taken a toll on animals in Tennessee this week. Authorities rescued 21 dogs from a garage and a concrete shed-like structure on the premises of a Lawrenceburg home that’s “unfit for human or animal lodging,” the Lawrence County sheriff said. Temperatures in the area were in the 90s, and the dogs had no food or water. The dogs were removed from the property and received treatment. In Arizona this week, some cactuses died at a Phoenix botanical garden from soaring temperatures, and officials in the state also were reporting emergency room visits for extreme heat burns after people fall to the ground. CNN’s Eli Masket, Chris Boyette, Robert Shackelford and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report."

Scientists just reported that July will be the hottest month on record. And now, after years of skepticism and denial in the GOP ranks, a small number of Republicans are urging their party to get proactive on the climate crisis. But the GOP is stuck in a climate bind – and likely will be for the next four years, in large part because they’re still living in the shadow of former president and 2024 Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. Even as more Republican politicians are joining the consensus that climate change is real and caused by humans, Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric has driven the party to the right on climate and extreme weather. Trump has called the extremely settled science of climate change a “hoax” and more recently suggested that the impacts of it “may affect us in 300 years.” Scientists this week reported that this summer’s unrelenting heat wave would have been “virtually impossible” were it not for the planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels. They also confirmed that July will go down as the hottest month on record – and almost certainly that the planet’s temperature is hotter now than it has been in around 120,000 years. Yet for being one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century, climate is rarely mentioned on the 2024 campaign trail. “As Donald Trump is the near presumptive nominee of our party in 2024, it’s going to be very hard for a party to adopt a climate-sensitive policy,” Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah, told CNN. “But Donald Trump’s not going to be around forever.” When Republicans do weigh in on climate change – and what we should do about it – they tend to support the idea of capturing planet-warming pollution rather than cutting fossil fuels. But many are reticent to talk about how to solve the problem, and worry Trump is having a chilling effect on policies to combat climate within the party. “We need to be talking about this,” Rep. John Curtis, a Republican from Utah and chair of the House’s Conservative Climate Caucus, told CNN. “And part of it for Republicans is when you don’t talk about it, you have no ideas at the table; all you’re doing is saying what you don’t like. We need to be saying what we like.” With a few exceptions, Republicans largely are no longer the party of full-on climate change denial. But even as temperatures rise to deadly highs, the GOP is also not actively addressing it. There is still no “robust discussion about how to solve it” within the party, said former South Carolina Rep. Bob Inglis, who now runs the conservative climate group RepublicEn, save for criticism of Democrats’ clean-energy initiatives. “The good news is Republicans are stopping arguing with thermometers,” Inglis told CNN. Still, he said, “when the experience is multiplied over and over of multiple days of three-digit temperatures in Arizona and record ocean temperatures, people start to say, ‘this is sort of goofy we’re not doing something about this.’” Meanwhile, the impacts of a dramatically warming atmosphere are becoming more and more apparent each year. Romney and Curtis, two of the loudest climate voices in the party, both represent Utah – a state that’s no stranger to extreme heat and drought, which scientists say is being fueled by rising global temperatures. “There are a number of states, like mine, that are concerned about wildfires and water,” Romney said, adding he believes Republican governors of impacted states have been vocal about these issues. Utah and other Western states are looking for ways to cut water use to save the West’s shrinking two largest reservoirs, Lakes Powell and Mead. And even closer to home, Utah’s Great Salt Lake has already disappeared by two-thirds, and scientists are sounding alarms about a rapid continued decline that could kill delicate ecosystems and expose one of fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the nation to toxic dust. “I think the evidence so far is that the West is getting drier and hotter,” Romney told CNN. “That means that we’re going to have more difficulty with our crops, we’re going to have a harder time keeping the rivers full of water. The Great Salt Lake is probably going to continue to shrink. And unfortunately, we’re going to see more catastrophic fires. If the trends continue, we need to act.” While Republicans blast Democrats’ clean energy policies ahead of the 2024 elections, it’s less clear what the GOP itself would prefer to do about the climate crisis. As Curtis tells it, there’s a lot that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on. They both want to further reform the permitting process for major energy projects, and they largely agree on the need for more renewable and nuclear energy. As the head of the largest GOP climate caucus on the Hill, Curtis’ Utah home is “full solar,” he told CNN, and is heated using geothermal energy. While at a recent event at a natural gas drilling site in Ohio, as smoke from Canada’s devastating wildfire season hung thick in the air, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was asked how he would solve the climate crisis. He suggested planting a trillion trees to help offset the pollution created by burning fossil fuels – a bill House Republicans introduced in 2020. The measure has not yet passed the House and has an uncertain future in the Senate. But the biggest and most enduring difference between the two parties is that Republicans want fossil fuels – which are fueling climate change with their heat-trapping pollution – to be in the energy mix for years to come. Democrats, meanwhile, have passed legislation to dramatically speed up the clean energy transition and prioritize the development of wind, solar and electrical transmission to get renewables sending electricity into homes faster. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Democrats want to pass more climate legislation if they take back a full majority in Congress. He later told CNN the GOP is “way behind” on climate and there’s been “too little” progress on the party’s stances. “I think we’d get a lot more done with a Democratic House, a Democratic president and continuing to have a Democratic Senate,” Schumer told CNN. “Unfortunately, if you look at some of the Republican House and Senate Super PACs, huge amounts of money come from gas, oil and coal.” Even though Curtis and Romney are aligned on the party needing to talk about climate change, they differ on how to fix it. While Curtis primarily supports carbon capture and increased research and development into new technologies, Romney is one of the few Republicans speaking in favor of a carbon tax – taxing companies for their pollution. “It’s very unlikely that a price on carbon would be acceptable in the House of Representatives,” Romney said. “I think you might find a few Republican senators that would be supportive, but that’s not enough.” The idea certainly doesn’t have the support of Trump, or other 2024 candidates for president, and experts predict climate policy will get little to no airtime during the upcoming presidential race. “Regrettably, the issue of climate change is currently being held hostage to the culture wars in America,” Edward Maibach, a professor of climate communication at George Mason University and a co-founder of a nationwide climate polling project conducted with Yale University, told CNN in an email. “Donald Trump’s climate denial stance will have a chilling effect on the climate positions of his rivals on the right — even those who know better.” Even if climate-conscious Republicans say Trump won’t be in the party forever, Inglis said even a few more years may not be enough time to counteract the rapid changes already happening. “That’s still a long way away,” Inglis said. “The scientists are saying we can’t wait, get moving, get moving.”"

","Sophie Tanno, CNN","As the Northern Hemisphere swelters under a record-breaking summer heat wave, much further south, in the depths of winter, another terrifying climate record is being broken. Antarctic sea ice has fallen to unprecedented lows for this time of year. Every year, Antarctic sea ice shrinks to its lowest levels towards the end of February, during the continent’s summer. The sea ice then builds back up over the winter. But this year scientists have observed something different. The sea ice has not returned to anywhere near expected levels. In fact it is at the lowest levels for this time of year since records began 45 years ago. The ice is around 1.6 million square kilometers (0.6 million square miles) below the previous winter record low set in 2022, according to data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). In mid-July, Antarctica’s sea ice was 2.6 million square kilometers (1 million square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average. That is an area nearly as large as Argentina or the combined areas of Texas, California, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado The phenomenon has been described by some scientists as off-the-charts exceptional – something that is so rare, the odds are that it only happens once in millions of years. But Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, said that speaking in these terms may not be that helpful. “The game has changed,” he told CNN. “There’s no sense talking about the odds of it happening the way the system used to be, it’s clearly telling us that the system has changed.” Scientists are now scrambling to figure out why. The Antarctic is a remote, complex continent. Unlike the Arctic, where sea ice has been on a consistently downwards trajectory as the climate crisis accelerates, sea ice in the Antarctic has swung from record highs to record lows in the last few decades, making it harder for scientists to understand how it is responding to global heating. But since 2016, scientists have begun to observe a steep downwards trend. While natural climate variability affects the sea ice, many scientists say climate change may be a major driver for the disappearing ice. “The Antarctic system has always been highly variable,” Scambos said. “This [current] level of variation, though, is so extreme that something radical has changed in the past two years, but especially this year, relative to all previous years going back at least 45 years.” Several factors feed into sea ice loss, Scambos said, including the strength of the westerly winds around Antarctica, which have been linked to the increase of planet-heating pollution. “Warmer ocean temperatures north of the Antarctic Ocean boundary mixing into the water that’s typically somewhat isolated from the rest of the world’s oceans is also part of this idea as to how to explain this,” Scambos said. In late February of this year, Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent since records began, at 691,000 square miles. This winter’s unprecedented occurrence may indicate a long-term change for the isolated continent, Scambos said. “It is more likely than not that we won’t see the Antarctic system recover the way it did, say, 15 years ago, for a very long period into the future, and possibly ‘ever.’” Others are more cautious. “It’s a large departure from average but we know that Antarctic sea ice exhibits large year to year variability,” Julienne Stroeve, a senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center told CNN, adding “it’s too early to say if this is the new normal or not.” Sea ice plays a vital role. While it doesn’t directly affect sea level rise, as it’s already floating in the ocean, it does have indirect effects. Its disappearance leaves coastal ice sheets and glaciers exposed to waves and warm ocean waters, making them more vulnerable to melting and breaking off. A lack of sea ice could also have significant impacts on its wildlife, including krill on which many of the region’s whales feed, and penguins and seals that rely on sea ice for feeding and resting. More broadly, Antarctica’s sea ice contributes to the regulation of the planet’s temperature, meaning its disappearance could have cascading effects far beyond the continent. The sea ice reflects incoming solar energy back to space, when it melts, it exposes the darker ocean waters beneath which absorb the sun’s energy. Parts of Antarctica have been seeing alarming changes for a while. The Antarctic Peninsula, a spindly chain of icy mountains which sticks off the west side of the continent, is one of the fastest warming places in the Southern Hemisphere. Last year, scientists said West Antarctica’s vast Thwaites Glacier – also known as the “Doomsday Glacier” – was “hanging on by its fingernails” as the planet warms. Scientists have estimated global sea level rise could increase by around 10 feet if Thwaites collapsed completely, devastating coastal communities around the world. Scambos said that this winter’s record low level of sea ice is a very alarming signal. “In 2016, [Antarctic sea ice] took the first big down-turn. Since 2016, it’s remained low, and now the bottom has fallen out. Something major in a huge part of the planet is suddenly behaving differently from what we saw for the past 45 years.” CNN’s Laura Paddison contributed to this report."

But there are those who would rather that it come from hostile states than from supplies we have here at home,” Sunak said in a statement. He also announced plans to build two new carbon capture and storage sites in the North Sea, to be completed by 2030, which would take the country’s total to four. Carbon capture facilities work at the source of the pollution by putting emissions into contact with a liquid solvent, which extracts the carbon dioxide in a process called chemical scrubbing. That reduces the amount of carbon that would otherwise go into the atmosphere. The carbon can then be stored in products like cement, or buried deep underground. The UK announcement comes despite evidence that the climate crisis is accelerating, and flies in the face of a previous warning from the International Energy Agency that there must be no new investment in oil and gas exploration if the world is to have any chance of restricting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Centigrade above pre-industrial levels. Sunak’s office said he had committed to granting “hundreds” of new licenses for companies to drill for oil and gas offshore, with the first 100 expected to be granted in the fall. The licensing process, overseen by the North Sea Transition Authority, will be more flexible to allow companies to drill near currently licensed areas, “unlocking vital reserves which can be brought online faster,” Sunak’s office said in a statement. However, the process would still apply a “climate compatibility test” to all prospective licenses, it added. Simon Roddy, senior vice president of Shell UK’s exploration and production business, said in a statement that the announcement of a new carbon capture and storage project in Scotland was “an important step forward” for the industry. “[The project] is a central part of plans to decarbonize North Sea operations, and to store emissions from other parts of Scottish industry,” he said. Climate groups have criticized Sunak’s announcement as a setback for the UK’s environmental goals. “Extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea will send a wrecking ball through the UK’s climate commitments at a time when we should be investing in a just transition to a low carbon economy and our own abundant renewables,” Lyndsay Walsh, Oxfam’s climate change policy advisor, said in a Monday statement. Philip Evans, oil and gas transition campaigner for Greenpeace UK, also said Monday that the government had “decided to row back on key climate policies, attempted to toxify net zero, and recycled old myths about North Sea drilling.” “Relying on fossil fuels is terrible for our energy security, the cost of living, and the climate,” Evans said. Sunak’s announcement puts his Conservative government at loggerheads with the opposition Labour Party, which has called for a ban on all new oil and gas projects in the North Sea, and a funneling of new investment into the country’s renewable energy industry."

The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. The scorching weather that has parched the southwestern United States, along with much of the rest of the country, may finally — finally — be about to relent. Forecasters say that for the first time in a month, high temperatures in Phoenix may finally dip below 110 degrees Fahrenheit this week. But relief is a relative term. We are on the cusp of the start of August, which in Arizona historically is just a couple of degrees cooler than July. And in this year of record-shattering heat, it’s impossible to know whether the past patterns will hold. Phoenix was actually enjoying a surprisingly mild summer. Then July hit. The city has made headlines around the globe and broken all sorts of records. It’s currently enduring the longest stretch topping 110 F or higher (29 days and counting). Phoenix just finished 16 straight days with lows above 90 F. Mid-July featured nine consecutive days at or above 115 F. I’ve lived in the aptly named “Valley of the Sun” since childhood, so I’m used to the region’s scorching heat and dust-dry desert climate. But even for natives, the month has been brutal. The city’s transportation service is providing buses to the homeless so they can at least sit in an air-conditioned space during the hottest part of the day. For those even less fortunate, the county coroner has rented refrigerated containers as backup storage. “While we typically see a surge in intakes to the Office of the Medical Examiner in July, this year has been worse than prior years,” Jason Berry, a Maricopa County spokesman, said last week. Phoenix still hasn’t topped its all-time high of 122 F back in 1990 — at least not yet. As I write, it’s a balmy 112 F. Many commentators are quick to blame climate change but offer few concrete solutions to mitigate the issue Phoenix summers will always be hot — I mean, it’s Phoenix — but smart solutions can keep it from getting worse. I often explain to outsiders that Phoenix only has two months of awful heat — about mid-July to mid-September. That’s when the humidity rises a touch, with the temperatures north of 100 F late into the evening. (I’ll still take two hot months over four months of gray, icy winter misery in the upper Midwest.) That said, it doesn’t take a climate scientist to recognize the rising intensity of our summers. Growing up on the northern edge of the sprawling city, the days were hot, but nights cooled off considerably. There isn’t much heat retention in the open desert, especially compared with the hundreds of square miles of black pavement and urban sprawl. Once the sun sets, city streets slowly release the pent-up heat for many hours. Our Sonoran Desert region also gets annual monsoon storms this time of year, which usually help mitigate the highest highs. So far, those dramatic thunderstorms haven’t made much of an appearance. Seemingly it’s less so each year. The rapid growth of Phoenix has created a “heat island” effect. Replacing virgin desert with concrete, glass and steel resulted in a thermal dome extending vertically above the city, leading to much higher nighttime temperatures. As monsoon storms gather strength in the late afternoon, the rising urban heat raises the atmospheric pressure above the city. This pushes the cooling rains away from Phoenix and its expansive suburbs. More rain for the open deserts, but precious little for us sweaty city folk. And the more desert cities grow, the worse the heat island effect. Thankfully, new fixes are being rolled out to reduce the problem. Visitors often remark on Arizona “lawns” consisting of sandy-colored desert rock and a few desert plants. (My Midwestern relatives never let me hear the end of it.) But adaptive xeriscaping reduces the use of precious water and returns these little plots of land into cooler desert spaces. On a larger scale, replacing blazing-hot asphalt with “cool pavements” reflects more solar energy, enhances water evaporation and doesn’t retain as much heat. Following a successful 2021 pilot program, Phoenix began coating streets with a unique treatment that significantly reduces street temperatures. So far, 100 miles have been covered, with many more on the way. The city also instituted a cool roof program 10 years ago, replacing darker standard roofs with much more reflective colors and materials. So far, only 3.5% of buildings in the area can be considered “cool,” but it’s well worth the upgrade. A 2021 study by Arizona State University found the process reduces energy use by an average of 17% and keeps roofs as much as 50 degrees cooler. By redoubling its commitment to these promising technologies, Phoenix can reduce the heat island effect and help temperatures return to their natural level. At the same time, these technologies can reduce energy demand, air conditioning costs and health issues, helping both residents and the climate. Phoenix doesn’t have the luxury to wait for world leaders to “fix” the climate, whatever that might entail. The city’s rapid growth helped create the rising urban temperatures; it’s up to us residents to solve it."

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. Record-long extreme heat streaks are finally coming to an end, but despite the signs of relief, the dangerous heat isn’t going away completely. The relentless heat dome driving the deadly heat wave will meander across the southern tier of the US this week, bringing more record-breaking temperatures. The numbers so far this summer have been jaw-dropping: In El Paso, Texas, the high temperature topped 100 degrees for a record-breaking 44 straight days; in Miami, the heat index stayed above 100 degrees for 46 consecutive days; and in Phoenix, temperatures have been at or above 110 degrees for 31 consecutive days. All of those streaks will have ended by Monday if Phoenix hits its closer-to-average forecast high of 108 degrees. It’s been so hot for so long the average temperature for Phoenix for the month of July set a record at 103 degrees, shattering the previous one by 4 degrees. It goes to show this heat has been exceptional even for one of the nation’s hottest cities. “It’s been a year of abnormalities and streaks, so it’s just a testament to just how strange this year has been,” said Ryan Worley, meteorologist for the National Weather Service office in Phoenix. Why temperatures have been so hot Phoenix has yet to join other parts of the state with measurable monsoon rain, something that the city is desperately counting on to cool temperatures down. If Phoenix receives rainfall Monday, it would be the third latest monsoon rainfall on record. The city will get a slight “break” from the heat Monday and Tuesday as the threat of monsoon rains rolls through, but highs will be back up above 110 degrees by midweek, possibly making it to 116 degrees by the weekend. Meanwhile, with little rain for relief, more than 40 million people across the Deep South and Southern Plains are still under heat alerts. More than 140 potential high temperature records could fall again this week, as the oppressive heat shows no signs of backing down across the country’s midsection. It is especially true in Dallas. The city could experience its hottest days of the year this week, with highs potentially topping 110 degrees on Tuesday. High temperatures will stay in the triple digits all the way through the weekend, at times running as much as 10 degrees above normal. Little Rock, Arkansas, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Houston will feel as hot as 110 degrees or higher Monday and much of the week, with no relief in sight. Unfortunately, there is no real chance of cooler temperatures for some of the hottest locations for the foreseeable future, as this dome of high pressure responsible for the extreme heat won’t budge."

For Call to Earth Day 2023, CNN is focusing on the crucial connection between cities and wilderness.                                             ","Nadia Leigh-Hewitson, CNN","With most of the world’s population residing in cities, it’s often challenging to understand how our actions affect remote and wild regions. For Call to Earth Day 2023, we will focus on the vital link between urban areas and wilderness, and shed light on the impact cities have on distant natural spaces. This year’s Call to Earth Day will take place on Wednesday, November 28, with the theme “Our Shared Home.” From the inner city to the suburbs, the plains, the mountains, the jungle, and beyond, we must protect and nurture our connected ecosystems. Here, we explore how our cities can be part of the great tapestry of habitats on Earth. Pollution remains a significant challenge in city centers. Urban areas produce roughly 78% of carbon emissions worldwide and an estimated 60% of plastic waste found in the ocean begins its journey in a city, but innovative solutions to combat pollution can be found across the planet. One example comes from Varanasi, a city on the Ganges, India’s holiest river. Here, discarded temple flowers clog up the waterways, so a local initiative started collecting the floral waste and transforming it into sustainable products. By repurposing these blooms, the project reduces river pollution and waste while providing employment opportunities for local people who process the waste flowers to create carbon-free incense and eco-friendly artificial leather. This effort highlights how cultural practice and environmental consciousness can go hand in hand. As urbanization continues to accelerate, so does the loss of biodiversity – a predicted 11 to 33 million hectares of natural habitat will be lost by 2100 as a result of urban development. But around the world people are working to carve out safe havens for animals among the high-rises and intersections. The concrete jungle of Hong Kong is home to yellow-crested cockatoos, which, despite not being native to the area, are thriving thanks to safe nesting spaces created in an effort to conserve the critically endangered species. The feral flock is thought to represent around 10% of the remaining population, showing how cities can be safe spaces for wildlife. Across the globe, cities are making strides to provide urban habitats for wildlife, such as the introduction of floating ecosystems to city waterways, offering refuge to urban aquatic species. As cities grow, it becomes crucial to incorporate green spaces to maintain ecological balance and protect biodiversity. Through the sprawl of cities, animals increasingly encounter challenges in navigating their once-open territories. Land-crossing migratory routes and even birds’ flight paths are under threat. A 2021 report on the disruption of wild animal migratory patterns found that a third of the animals studied had changed their normal migration route due to disturbance caused by human activities, such as hunting, agriculture, and logging. Wildlife bridges, tunnels, and corridors – such as those constructed in Canada’s Banff National Park – enable animals to migrate safely. These initiatives foster coexistence between humans and wildlife, ensuring animals can roam freely without risking their lives on busy roads. As populations continue to rise, cities will continue to grow and eat into natural landscapes, but we can help combat the damage by making the buildings greener. Nature-friendly buildings aim to harmonize with the environment rather than imposing on it. Such structures incorporate green roofs, vertical gardens, and energy-efficient designs, reducing their carbon footprint. From carbon-neutral office buildings to penthouses cloaked in leafy plants, cities around the planet are already adopting climate-friendly constructions. Some cities are even offering incentives to developers who integrate nature-friendly features, encouraging a more sustainable urban landscape. By blending the urban and natural worlds, these buildings can become a crucial part of the solution to create greener cities for future generations. Keeping cities clean through imaginative pollution solutions, creating spaces for wildlife, facilitating animal movement, and constructing nature-friendly buildings can mean a healthier and more sustainable coexistence between humans and the natural world. These positive changes not only benefit local ecosystems and biodiversity but also enhance the health and quality of life for city dwellers. For Call to Earth Day 2023, we will celebrate the initiatives that pave the way for greener, wildlife-friendly, and more resilient cities in the face of global environmental challenges. Join us for Call to Earth Day, “Our Shared Home,” on November 28th 2023."

Now Rishi Sunak is stoking a culture war on green policies,08/01/2023,"                                                 Less than two years ago, Britain was championing itself as a global leader in the fight against the climate crisis. Things feel very different now.                                             ","Analysis by Rob Picheta, CNN","Less than two years ago, Britain was championing itself as a global leader in the fight against the climate crisis. At the pivotal COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson rallied world leaders to find agreement on a historic resolution acknowledging the role of fossil fuels in the climate crisis, and the late Queen Elizabeth II said in a landmark speech that “time for words has now moved to the time for action.” Things feel very different now. As Rishi Sunak’s beleaguered government limps towards an election it is widely expected to lose, determination has seemingly been swapped for division. And after a decade of cross-party consensus on tackling the climate crisis, experts fear that Sunak has identified green policies as a new wedge issue that could help reverse his party’s sagging fortunes. Sunak said Monday he wants to “max out” oil and gas developments in Britain’s North Sea, announcing an expansion in drilling for the fossil fuels that environmental groups have condemned. The move followed a proclamation from Sunak to Britain’s drivers, in the Telegraph newspaper, that he was “on their side,” as he ordered a review of “anti-motorist” low-traffic neighborhoods created to improve urban air quality. Jibes towards climate activists have meanwhile become a common feature at the despatch box in parliament. And in combative interview exchanges on Monday, Sunak defended his frequent use of a jet or helicopter to attend events around the UK – a habit that opposition politicians have often criticized. “What the government seems to be doing is using the climate to divide the public,” Luke Murphy, the associate director for energy, climate, housing and infrastructure at the progressive IPPR think tank, told CNN. “There does seem to be a degree of political opportunism around what they’ve been doing.” Few expect the new push to be an election-winner. But Murphy, like many climate experts, fears there are wider ramifications for Britain’s global standing. “For all the faults of the Boris Johnson government, what you can say is there appeared to be a genuine commitment to net zero and to the climate agenda,” he said. “Since then we’ve gone backwards. We’ve stalled in many policy areas,” Murphy added. “I don’t think many people would actually now consider the UK to be a global leader (on the climate).” Since coming into power, Sunak has been scrambling for wedge issues that could resonate with Britons and turn around his party’s woeful standing with the public. Small boat crossings of asylum-seekers, transgender protections and other so-called “culture war” battles have all been eagerly waged by a prime minister who vowed during his first leadership campaign last year to stop “woke nonsense.” But amid a deepening cost of living crisis and the decline in Britain’s public services, Sunak has failed to shake the increasingly sticky label applied to him – that he is a caretaker of the managed decline of the Conservative Party, which has ruled for 13 years and is running low on ideas. A glimmer of hope arrived for Sunak, however, in an unexpected and narrow victory in the by-election to replace Boris Johnson as an MP for Uxbridge, a region on the western fringe of London. The vote was dominated by local opposition to the expansion of London’s world-first low-emissions zone, which gave local Conservatives a rare issue on which they could go on the offensive. “This campaign is a referendum on ULEZ,” the area’s new MP Steve Tuckwell told CNN in the days leading up to the vote. “We know it’s going to devastate local businesses,” said Tuckwell, who omitted virtually any mention of his party from leaflets and instead branded himself the “anti-ULEZ candidate.” In the days since that vote, and despite losing a significant share of the votes in the region, leading Conservatives have gleefully picked up the anti-green baton. Ministers have increasingly conflated emissions-slashing agendas with the activist fringes of the climate movement, trying to draw links between the opposition Labour Party and Just Stop Oil, the divisive group known for interrupting national events with guerilla protests. Announcing the North Sea drilling expansion on Monday, Energy Secretary Grant Shapps claimed that the opposition Labour Party are the “political wing” of Just Stop Oil, despite the party’s leader Keir Starmer criticizing the group’s tactics. In June, Sunak claimed that “eco-zealots” are writing Labour’s energy policy. “What you are seeing is a much more populist way of handling (the climate),” Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London and the author of books on the Conservatives, told CNN. “Uxbridge has encouraged the party to feel – in the absence of many other policies that are going well for them – that it’s a move that has some traction with a certain section of voters,” Bale said. More than three-quarters of British households have a car, and the rate of carless households has fallen steadily in recent years. It is a difficult path for Sunak to tread. Even voters opposed to schemes like ULEZ do not necessarily lack concern about the climate; the topic has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, with nearly two-thirds of Britons consistently ranking it among the most important issues facing the country, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan has forcefully defended his city’s programs, including ULEZ, which last week survived a legal challenge brought by five Conservative councils. On Sunday, Khan nodded to recent heatwaves and wildfires in Europe, writing: “The world is on fire – and this is all the leadership we’re getting from Rishi Sunak.” And Sunak’s approach to the climate is increasingly earning him enemies within his own party. Foreign Office minister Zac Goldsmith resigned in June, lambasting Sunak’s climate policies. “The problem is not that the government is hostile to the environment, it is that you, our prime minister, are simply uninterested,” he wrote in his resignation letter. And on Monday Chris Skidmore, a Conservative former energy minister who is now on the backbenches, said Sunak’s expansion of North Sea drilling puts him on “the wrong side of history.” Skidmore called the move “the wrong decision at precisely the wrong time, when the rest of the world is experiencing record heat waves.” But with Britain agitating for a change in leadership and with little else to champion, Uxbridge has apparently given Sunak a blueprint for next year’s election – and waging battles with detractors may help him elevate his pitch. “There aren’t many obvious other avenues for this government to go down,” Bale, the politics professor, said. “This, like the small boats issue, perhaps provides a bit of a distraction for people.” “You can see a very obvious parallel with what’s going on with migration,” he added. “That is a typically populist attack line – making a distinction between people on the one hand, and elites on the other.”"

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","Rising temperatures have sucked more than 10 trillion gallons of water out of the Colorado River Basin between 2000 and 2021 – a volume about the size of Lake Mead – according to a recent study. Researchers at UCLA found the human-caused climate crisis is contributing significantly to the decline of the Colorado River, which runs through seven Western states and provides drinking and irrigation water for around 40 million people. Higher temperatures in the West have resulted in about a 10% decrease in the river’s flow in the last two decades, according to the study, which was published in the American Geophysical Union’s Water Resources Research. The climate crisis has had such a significant impact on the basin that without it, the river’s first-ever water shortage would not have been declared, the researchers found. The Tier 1 shortage took effect in January 2022; a Tier 2 shortage – due to even lower water levels at Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir – was implemented in January 2023. “When we set out on this study we were aware of the mega-drought and the impacts it was having on Lake Mead’s water levels,” Benjamin Bass, a water resources engineer and the study’s lead author, told CNN. “We really wanted to provide a study that was able to look at that long-term drought event and the impacts of anthropogenic climate change.” State leaders and water users along the Colorado River have spent much of the last two years scrambling to find ways to cut their water usage as the system spiraled to alarming lows. Last summer in particular set off alarm bells when the water level in Lake Mead dropped an astonishing 20 feet over the course of four months. Mead, fed by the Colorado River, fell to its lowest level to-date in July 2022, with lake elevation of 1040 feet. If it falls an additional 145 feet, the reservoir hits “dead pool,” the point at which it’s unable to provide water or hydroelectric power to millions of customers. The increased evaporation from rising temperatures is especially problematic in snowier states like Colorado, where the river’s headwaters begin. “It’s increasing more across the snow-packed region as compared to regions without snowpack,” Bass said, noting that reductions of water are happening “twice as fast” in snowier regions. That’s in part due to a positive albedo effect – what happens when more snow melts with higher temperatures, exposing darker ground that absorbs still more heat. Bass and a team of researchers at UCLA conducted the experiment by modeling stream flow in the Colorado River basin under two conditions: one with historical temperature conditions and one where they removed the impacts of anthropogenic warming caused by climate change. They found that climate change-driven temperatures have had a dramatic impact, reducing flows over time. Even though last winter dumped above-average snowpack and water into the basin, Bass said that the 10% reduction in flow from 2000 to 2021 has remained consistent, even during wetter years. “That’s occurring for wet or dry years,” Bass said. “Even though there’s been a wet winter, there’s still going to be that 10% reduction in runoff.” The UCLA study came to a similar conclusion as one conducted by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which projected an 11.7% decrease in annual stream flow, factoring in climate change. Despite using different models, NCAR hydrometeorologist Ethan Gutmann told CNN the two studies came to the “same conclusion.” “We expect the longterm increases in temperature that we know are going to continue and since the Colorado River basin in particular seems to be very sensitive to temperature, we expect runoff in this basin to continue to decline,” Gutmann said. A blockbuster winter has helped Mead’s levels inch up this summer. The reservoir is expected to reach a high point of 1,070 feet in February 2024, according to the most recent federal data. Meanwhile, federal officials and state water users will soon start formal negotiations to see how water use in the basin can further be reduced, an attempt to counteract decades of overuse combined with the hotter and drier future in the Western US. “Unless greenhouse gases are curbed, those [water] reductions are going to continue to track with temperature increases,” Bass told CNN."

In Latin, pyro means “fire” and cumulus means “pile” or “heap.” They form over heat sources due to the intense, upward vertical motion of air cooling and condensing as it moves higher into the sky. If fires burn hot enough, they can create clouds that produce lighting and rain, called pyrocumulonimbus. Pyrocumulonimbus clouds look much darker than typical clouds because of their large amounts of smoke and ash. They can reach heights of 50,000 feet and generate their own systems of thunderstorms. And sometimes, lightning strikes generated from them even can ignite additional fires. Fire whirls occur when superheated air near the surface of a large fire zone rises rapidly in an air mass that also spins, much like a dust devil or whirlwind. But instead of dust, the rapidly rising air above a wildfire can accelerate into a very tightly spinning column of air composed of fire. Thunderstorms formed by pyrocumulonimbus clouds can spawn large fire whirls – sometimes called firenadoes – if there is enough instability in the atmosphere. The most extreme example of this happened during the 2018 Carr Fire in California. The wildfire spawned a fire vortex with winds as high as 140 mph and temperatures up to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. However, typical spin-ups from wildfires have a weaker spin and do not normally meet tornado qualifications. The clouds of smoke that wildfires can produce may also serve to cool the environment in some cases. Such clouds can be thick enough that sunlight struggles to get through, leaving the surface much cooler than it would have been if warmed by the sun. These clouds can sometimes produce rain to help put out a fire, though the rain often evaporates before reaching the ground because of the hot, dry environment."

It is targeting 62 municipalities clustered in its north and northeast, with the aim of “combating the effects of drought and contributing to the recharge of aquifers,” according to a statement from the Ministry of Agriculture. Cloud seeding is a technology first discovered in the 1940s. Since then, it has been used in around 50 countries, including in the United States and China. Mexico has been experimenting with weather modification for more than seven decades. However, some scientists remain very cautious about the effectiveness of cloud seeding and warn that it is not a solution to drought. “It has a controversial history because it’s very difficult to prove what you are doing from a scientific perspective,” Roelef Bruintjes, a weather modification scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the US, told CNN. For cloud seeding to work, you first need a cloud. Planes or drones inject particles into the cloud that attract water droplets to form around them, increasing the chance of rainfall or snowfall. “The whole idea is not ‘creating clouds’ – because we cannot make a cloud, we cannot chase away a cloud,” Bruintjes said. “But it’s trying to get a larger percentage of the water that is processed in the cloud down to the surface.” Mexico’s project involves spraying silver iodide particles into clouds from planes. The government hopes stimulating rainfall can help farmers better cope with the drought that has swept large swaths of the country. In mid-July, more than 40% of Mexico was in moderate to extreme drought, according to the national weather service. The country has also been sweltering through a severe heat wave that has killed at least 249 people over the past four months. This extreme weather is only set to get worse – scientists are clear that heat waves and drought will become more common and more intense as the climate crisis accelerates. Mexico contends that its current cloud seeding project, which it has been running since December 2020, has had a positive impact. In 2021, the cloud seeding flights had created 40% more rain, the government reported – a figure it calculated by measuring the difference between meteorological forecasts and actual rainfall measured by rain gauges. “Our projects have all been successful,” said a spokesman for the company Startup Renaissance, a rain stimulation company which has worked on the Mexican government project since 2020. But many scientists remain skeptical. There is a lack of “hard evidence” that cloud seeding increases precipitation, Fernando García García and Guillermo Montero Martínez of the cloud physics group at the National Autonomous University of Mexico wrote recently. Bruintjes echoed this. “In most situations you can say, OK, there is rain,” he said. “But is the rain from cloud seeding or is it not from cloud seeding? And that is really the big question.” The technology is also “not a drought-busting tool,” Bruintjes added, because during a drought, there is often an absence of clouds. “And that’s the one thing we cannot do. We cannot make a cloud.” Mexico’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Startup Renaissance said that criticisms of cloud seeding are based on old technology. The company’s technology is more effective, the spokesperson added, because it sprays the silver iodide, rather the more usual technique of applying it using flares. Bruintjes does believe cloud seeding could hold promise. There is evidence that US projects aimed at enhancing snowpack over the mountains in states including Wyoming and Idaho have seen some success, he said. But there is a need for much more research and data, he added. Some experts have called for more attention to be placed on less expensive and high-tech ways of protecting water resources. Cloud seeding “should be considered only as one element” in a much broader strategy, wrote García and Martínez."

But this year, in mid-winter, they have soared far higher. The commune of Vicuña reached 37.1 degrees Celsius (98.8 Fahrenheit) on August 2.  “This temperature is the highest recorded in this period in all of Chile,” a spokesperson for the Meteorological Directorate of Chile told CNN. It also marks the second-highest temperature on record for the country’s winter – which runs from June until August. Only in August 1951 was a higher temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius (99.1 Fahrenheit) recorded in Copiapó. “Tuesday was likely the warmest winter day in northern Chile in 72 years,” Raul Cordero, a climatologist at University of Groningen in the Netherlands, told CNN. In Argentina, some places reached highs of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4), according to the country’s national meteorological service. The capital Buenos Aires – where August temperatures usually average 18 degrees Celsius (64.4 Fahrenheit) – experienced its hottest start to August in 117 years of data, with temperatures of just over 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) on August 1. This smashed the previous record for that day of 24.6 degrees Celsius (76.3 Fahrenheit) set in 1942. For comparison, New Orleans’ average high the first week of February is also 18 degrees Celsius, and the city has never been above 28.3 degrees Celsius in the first week of February. The high temperatures are expected to continue for the next five to six days, concentrated in Northern Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and southwest Brazil, where they could reach up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), Herrara told CNN on Wednesday. “What we are experiencing is the combination of two phenomena: a global warming trend due to climate change plus the El Niño phenomenon,” Rojas said on Twitter. El Niño, a natural climate pattern that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean, brings warmer-than-average sea-surface temperatures and has a major influence on weather across the globe. Layered on top of global warming, caused by humans burning planet-warming fossil fuels, temperatures can reach record-breaking levels. This extreme heat in parts of South America fits into a broader global pattern. July was the planet’s hottest month on record by a significant margin, and scientists found the heat waves that seared parts of the US, southern Europe and China in the Northern Hemisphere summer were made significantly more likely by the human-caused climate crisis. “What to do? We know the solution: stop burning fossil fuels urgently!” Rojas said. For Cordero, this winter’s unusual heat is alarming. “Just like the rest of the world, the combination of climate change and El Niño is pushing temperatures into the unknown,” he said."

Extreme heat is contributing to this unwelcome price spike. The problem is that refineries, like humans, can’t handle persistently sweltering temperatures. When temperatures soar to 100 or even 110 degrees Fahrenheit, these complex facilities can’t churn out all the gasoline consumers want or need. And that loss of supply is occurring just as demand is at or near a peak this summer driving season. “Refineries break down in extreme heat. It’s like running an engine at very hot temperatures for a long time,” said Tom Kloza, president of the Oil Price Information Service. As refineries have suffered outages, pump prices have soared. The national average for regular gasoline has climbed by 30 cents over just the past month alone to $3.83 a gallon, according to AAA. Ironically, all of this shows that not even oil and gas companies — an industry that scientists blame in part for global warming —  are immune from the consequences of the climate crisis. And consumers are suffering the consequences as gas prices rise, a development that threatens to undo some of the progress made on the inflation front across the economy. Of course, extreme heat is not the sole factor behind the gas price jump. Oil prices continue to be the main driver of retail pump prices. And since mid-June, US oil prices have climbed by 22%, reflecting easing recession fears and promises by Saudi Arabia and Russia to restrain supply. Saudi Arabia on Thursday announced plans to extend a 1-million-barrel-per-day voluntary supply cut for another month and threatened to do even more this fall. Russia also announced plans to slash oil exports by 300,000 barrels per day in September. Still, high heat is clearly piling pressure on gas prices. In the Middle East, extreme temperatures are forcing some nations to burn oil to keep the lights on and meet demand for air conditioning. In Texas, Louisiana and elsewhere along the Gulf Coast, some refineries have been forced to slow activity due to unscheduled maintenance. In order to churn out gasoline, jet fuel and diesel, refineries heat crude oil, sometimes to 900 or 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, to break the molecules down, according to Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates. After heating the oil, it must be cooled to get the finished product. Normally, that is a standard process, but everything changes in triple-digit temperatures that persist. “As it gets hotter outside, the cooling back down gets more and more difficult,” said Lipow. High heat can also snarl maintenance efforts at refineries. From a pure profit standpoint, refineries have every incentive to go all out right now. Profit margins are high, making it lucrative to maximize the production of gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. “Refineries are doing very, very well — if they can keep their operations going. The profit potential and the motivation is there to run as hard as you can,” said Kloza. However, Kloza said most refiners that would like to run at 100% capacity are only able to run at 85% when it’s 100 degrees outside. This is a particular issue because refinery capacity has dropped in recent years, leaving little room for error. “There really is no slack in the system,” said Lipow. This situation has also helped drive up jet fuel and diesel prices. Diesel is a crucial fuel for the economy, powering trucks, boats and trains. Higher transportation costs will eventually get passed along to consumers. Retail diesel prices have surged by 31 cents a gallon over the past month, according to AAA. The futures market is signaling more gains to come for diesel. “Everyone gets really excited about high gas prices. But those fuels have an even more insidious impact on inflation,” Kloza said. The good news is there are signs the impact of high heat on gas prices may be easing. Even as retail prices continue to climb, wholesale prices for gasoline have flattened out. “I think we’re hitting a plateau,” said Kloza. Drivers should catch a break in the coming weeks as fuel demand typically drops in September when summer ends. Kloza said gas prices could just be pennies away from their peak of the summer. The one catch? If there’s a major hurricane, perhaps one strengthened by the unusually warm ocean temperatures, that threatens the Gulf Coast and its hub of refineries."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/04/world/ocean-heat-temperature-record-climate/index.html,Global ocean temperatures soared to the highest level on record this week,08/04/2023,"                                                 The temperature of the planet’s oceans rose to new heights this week, setting a new record with no sign of cooling down.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","The temperature of the planet’s oceans rose to new heights this week, setting a new record with no sign of cooling down. The average global ocean surface temperature hit 20.96 degrees Celsius (69.7 Fahrenheit) at the end of July, according to modern data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, beating the previous record of 20.95 degrees Celsius set in 2016. The Copernicus ocean data goes back to 1979. Scientists say the world needs to brace for ocean temperatures to keep rising as the arrival of El Niño – the natural climate fluctuation that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean, and has a warming impact – layers on top of human-caused global warming. Kaitlin Naughten, an oceanographer at British Antarctic Survey, said the data from Copernicus painted an alarming picture for the health of the oceans. “Other datasets may give slightly different values – for example, [the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] is reporting that last April was still very slightly warmer than now,” she told CNN. But what’s clear, she said, is “that current sea surface temperatures are exceptionally and unseasonably warm” and bringing wide-ranging implications, “especially for complex ecosystems such as coral reefs.” Gregory C. Johnson, an oceanographer at NOAA, said sea surface temperatures have soared this year. “What we’re seeing is a massive increase. It’s about 15 years worth of the long term warming trend in a year,” he told CNN. The heat could increase even further. Surface temperatures tend to remain high from August through to September before starting to decline, said Johnson. “There’s still room to have warmer sea surface temperatures” this year. Some marine heat waves this year have particularly shocked scientists for just how unprecedented they are, and the damage they are causing. Ocean heat can lead to the mass bleaching of coral reefs, as well as the death of other marine life and increased sea level rise. In the Florida Keys, a marine heat wave has pushed ocean temperatures to record-breaking, “hot tub” levels, leaving multiple coral reefs now completely bleached or dead. A “totally unprecedented” heat wave in the North Atlantic off the coasts of the UK and Ireland  in June – defined as “extreme” by NOAA – saw temperatures up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 Fahrenheit) hotter than usual, sparking concerns about the impacts on marine life. Samantha Burgess, the deputy director of Copernicus, said the heat in the North Atlantic was astonishing. “We’ve never seen that kind of extreme marine heat wave for that time of year … to see them in the open ocean, to see them in spring – that’s very surprising,” she told CNN in an interview last week. Warmer ocean water also has a climate impact. Oceans play a vital role as a buffer against the climate crisis by absorbing planet-heating pollution. Warmer water does this less effectively, meaning more carbon is left in the atmosphere, fueling global warming. Some scientists are concerned that the ocean temperature records set this year could mark the start of an alarming trend for ocean heat. “We are continuing to put greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,” Johnson said. “And so, in the long term, sea surface temperatures are just going to continue to increase until we as a society decide to to cut our use of fossil fuels very substantially.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/05/us/heat-triple-digit-temperatures-dg/index.html,100-degree days are becoming more common in the cities where most people live. These charts explain why.,08/05/2023,"Hot summer days in the United States have only been getting hotter. In the 25 largest US cities, days with highs breaking the 100-degree Fahrenheit barrier have become more common over the past 75 years, according to airport weather station data ...","Christopher Hickey, CNN","Hot summer days in the United States have only been getting hotter. In the 25 largest US cities, days with highs breaking the 100-degree Fahrenheit barrier have become more common over the past 75 years, according to airport weather station data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This year is no exception. Looking at the first seven months of each year, 2023 had the sixth-highest number of triple-digit highs in the 25 largest cities with available data since 1948, according to NOAA. Last year had the most days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit through the end of July in 75 years. Experts told CNN the climate crisis is intensifying heat waves and pushing days that would normally top out in the upper-90s into the triple-digits. As the number of days with extreme heat become more common, that puts an increasing strain both on individuals – especially those who work outside or don’t have access to adequate shelter – and a city’s infrastructure. “The climate has already changed. We’ve had increases in greenhouse gases for the past 150 years or more,” said David Easterling, chief of the Climate Assessments Section at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. “And what that translates to is that whether in Phoenix or Las Vegas, it’s just getting warmer there.” Overall, people living in the 25 largest cities have put up with an average of three more annual days over 100 degrees over the past 20 years than between 1948 and 1980. The average number of triple-digit temperature days have become more frequent between those two periods in 17 of the 25 largest US cities with available data, according to NOAA. Exactly how much more frequent triple-digit heat days have become varies widely across the country. Portland, Oregon, is seeing an additional day each year on average above 100 degrees since 2003 than it did between 1948 and 1980. Phoenix, on the other hand, is averaging 18 more triple-digit heat days between those same two periods. The number of triple-digit days has risen the most for a handful of cities in the Southwest and South. Residents of Phoenix, Austin, El Paso and San Antonio have seen especially startling temperature changes over the past 20 years. Between 1948 and 1980, there were 11 years when San Antonio didn’t see a single day above 100 degrees. Since 2003, though, the city has gone only one year without a day in the triple-digits. In Phoenix, a year with under 90 days with temperatures above 100 degrees used to be fairly common – it happened in 16 of the years before 1980. That’s no longer the case. The last time the city saw fewer than 90 days in the 100s was in 1998. There are always going to be local differences – the number of days over 100 degrees haven’t increased as much in Las Vegas as they have in Phoenix, Austin, El Paso or San Antonio, for example. But generally, temperatures go up significantly in areas where the soil and air are dry, Easterling said. Air moisture, or humidity, regulates temperatures and prevents it from spiking to extreme levels. Phoenix, which is located in the Sonoran Desert, runs so hot in part because of its dry climate – it has averaged just 7.22 inches of rain per year since 1948, according to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport weather station data. That’s less than an inch per month. But while humidity may moderate the air temperature, it can also make hot temperatures feel even hotter and put more pressure on the body, which struggles to cool itself in humid weather. “It’s important for people to remember that impacts on people and infrastructure don’t start at 100 degrees,” said James Doss-Gollin, an assistant professor at Rice University’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “Things like humidity and air quality can have a big impact on how our bodies feel heat.” Even relatively small increases in the number of days of triple-digit temperatures can have a dramatic effect on a population. Seattle’s Sea-Tac International Airport, for instance, recorded the lowest average number of days above 100 degrees out of any of the 25 largest cities over both 1948-1980 and since 2003. Between 1948 and 1980, not a single day broke 100 degrees. Then the airport registered three triple-digit days in 2021 alone. “Urban areas really have to start taking this seriously and begin to say, ‘How can we create a cooler environment?’” Easterling said. “Because we’re going to see temperatures increase as we continue to increase greenhouse gas. It’s a big issue.”"

","Rhea Mogul, CNN","Nearly half a billion children in South Asia are exposed to extreme high temperatures as life-threatening heat waves caused by the climate crisis become stronger and more frequent, according to the United Nations’ children’s agency. In a news release Monday, UNICEF said its analysis of 2020 data showed an estimated 460 million children in countries including Afghanistan, India and Pakistan were exposed to temperatures where 83 or more days in a year exceeded 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) – making South Asia the hardest-hit region for those under age 18. The analysis showed 76% of children in South Asia were exposed to extreme high temperature compared to 32% globally, UNICEF said. “Countries in the region are not the hottest in the world right now but the heat here brings life-threatening risks for millions of vulnerable children,” said Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF regional director for South Asia. “We are particularly concerned about babies, toddlers, malnourished children and pregnant women as they are most vulnerable to heat strokes and other serious effects.” Temperatures in some parts of India soared to 47 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit) in June, killing at least 44 people and sickening hundreds with heat-related illnesses. Some cities in Pakistan also saw similarly high temperatures the same month, raising fears especially for laborers who spend hours toiling outdoors and for poor populations with little to no cooling options. In parts of the country’s southern Sindh province, about 1.8 million people were exposed to temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) and higher, UNICEF said, giving rise to short and long-term health risks, including dehydration and organ failure. UNICEF warns the situation is exacerbated for children as they are unable to quickly adapt to such temperature change. The risks can be life threatening – from fainting and poor mental development to neurological dysfunction, seizures and cardiovascular diseases. Pregnant woman are particularly susceptible to heat and can experience preterm births and stillbirths, UNICEF said. Experts say the climate crisis is only going to cause more frequent and longer heat waves in the future, testing the region’s ability to adapt. India, the world’s most populous nation of 1.4 billion, often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June, but in recent years, they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged. In April 2022, India experienced a heat wave that saw temperatures in the capital New Delhi exceed 40 degrees Celsius for seven consecutive days. In some states, the heat closed schools, damaged crops and put pressure on energy supplies, as officials warned residents to remain indoors and keep hydrated. Experts have also warned the threat facing Afghanistan is particularly stark. Not only is there high potential for record extreme heat, the impacts are compounded by dire social and economic problems. At the same time, extreme weather has had a deadly impact in other parts of the region. Flooding caused by record monsoon rains and melting glaciers in Pakistan submerged a third of the country last year, killing nearly 1,600 people – more than a third of whom were children. While the water washed away homes and destroyed villages, water-related ailments began infecting children, giving rise to a new disaster in the nation of 230 million. In its report, UNICEF warned that ultimately children, adolescents and women are among those who pay the highest price for extreme weather events. “Young children simply cannot handle the heat,” Wijesekera said. “Unless we act now, these children will continue to bear the brunt of more frequent and more severe heat waves in the coming years, for no fault of theirs.”"

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. Record dry streaks and a long-lasting ridge of high pressure are teaming up to lock in dangerous heat and trigger an expanding drought across parts of the Southwest and Texas. This is particularly true in Phoenix, which just endured the hottest month on record for any US city and still hasn’t had any measurable rain, even though the monsoon season, which is responsible for bringing the Southwest at least 50% of its annual rainfall, started nearly two months ago. Phoenix is currently experiencing its driest three-month period on record, fueled by the second-latest first rain of the monsoon season. This, in combination with the much talked about stubborn area of high pressure, will keep temperatures in record territory for the foreseeable future. Phoenix needs monsoon rain to break the heat. It brings added moisture, cloud cover and rain which can moderate temperatures, especially from oppressive afternoon highs. It’s getting drier by the day, with nothing more than a 20 to 30% chance of rain through the week. Highs in Phoenix are expected to come down slightly this week – from a scorching 116 degrees on Saturday down to a forecast high of 104 degrees on Wednesday. However, the added monsoonal moisture will bring the humidity levels higher, which means the heat index, or “feels like” temperature, will be higher. It’s a no-win situation right now, unless they get rain. By the end of the week, moisture decreases and so do the chances for rain. And you guessed it: temperatures climb right back up to 110 degrees. The lack of rain is also putting the Lone Star State in a dire drought situation which is causing the threat of fires to grow. “It’s just going to keep deteriorating,” said Logan Scherschel, fire analyst for Texas A&M Forest Service. “There’s a pretty good recipe for a bad week coming up because the fields have been drying out for over a month.” Texas had a really wet spring, which produced a lot of fresh grass growth. Then the summer has been very dry and very hot. Several Texas cities, including Waco, Austin, Houston, Midland, San Angelo and Del Rio, have had little-to-no rainfall during the last few months and are all now experiencing their driest 30-day stretch on record. The heat is also helping dry out the ground even more. El Paso is expected to hit 109 degrees Monday, then hover around 105 degrees the rest of the week. The city has had 30 days this year with temperatures above 105 degrees, breaking the record for the most such days. Austin is also expected to stay around 105 degrees all week. The city endured 11 consecutive days above 105 degrees ending in late July, which was an all-time record. Much of the new grass that grew during the spring is dead now, creating the perfect fuel for the spread of fires. “We’re starting to not only see a lot of fires easily started and carried by the grass, but they’re starting to get what we call significant fires because they get very resistant to control as the brush and trees start burning,” Scherschel explained. Texas has had more than 100 fires burn in the last seven days alone, most of those in the more populated areas of the state from Dallas to Houston to San Antonio. “So even if fires don’t get thousands and thousands of acres in size, a small fire can still impact a pretty good-sized population,” Scherschel said. Much of the state is under heat alerts on Monday. There is also an elevated fire risk for West and Central Texas. “The combination of extremely hot temperatures, 20-30% RH (relative humidity) and very dry fuels has resulted in aggressive fire behavior,” according to the storm prediction center. More than 50% of Texas is in drought, with a small pocket of the most extreme level of drought covering the Hill Country. According to Scherschel, they need rain and a lot of it. “Pretty much at this point, it’s going to take some type of season-ending event, such as like a tropical storm or hurricane to bring a lot of Gulf moisture, a lot of rainfall on a lot of real estate,” Scherschel said."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","The world got its first preview last month of what summer will be like at 1.5 degrees of global warming — a threshold that scientists warn the planet should stay under, yet one that it has flown increasingly close to in recent years. The average global temperature in July, the hottest month on record by far, was around 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial era that ended in the mid-to-late 1800s, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service reported Tuesday. The announcement came after a series of deadly heat waves and remarkable record-breaking temperatures for several continents, as well as unprecedented ocean heat around the globe. Copernicus scientists say it’s the first summer month that has surpassed 1.5 degrees, offering a glimpse of future summers. The 1.5-degree threshold is significant because scientists consider it a key tipping point for the planet, beyond which the chances of extreme heat, flooding, drought, wildfires and food and water shortages will become even more unfavorable for life as we know it. It’s the goal that scientists chose in the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to minimize the damage of the climate crisis while affording time to wean society and the economy off planet-warming fossil fuels. It’s also not something that’s tracked by the day or month. Scientists are particularly concerned that global temperature will stay above 1.5 degrees for the long term. Through 2022, the world had warmed around 1.2 degrees. “While breaking the 1.5-degrees-Celsius threshold for a day or a week or a month is not the same as breaking it for the long-term average, it is important to monitor how frequently, and for how long, we exceed this threshold,” Rebecca Emerton, scientist with Copernicus, told CNN. “As temperatures continue to rise, the effects will continue to become more serious.” The last few years have made it abundantly clear that the world is already feeling alarming effects of the climate crisis that many are not prepared for. If the planet continues to heat up, Emerton said the world will face even more extreme weather than what much of the planet has already experienced. “We’ve seen the impacts these kinds of events are already having on people and on our planet, and so every small part of a degree of warming is significant,” Emerton said. According to Berkeley Earth, an environmental data nonprofit, there have only been 10 other months that were warmer than 1.5 degrees Celsius above their historical average, with March 2023 being the most recent. Before that, the other months that have been 1.5 degrees warmer than pre-industrial times have occurred during winter or early spring. Berkeley Earth Lead Scientist Robert Rohde said surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius in July is the first time that threshold has ever been crossed during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, which makes this a critical moment for the planet. “While the past unusually warm winters are notable, observing extreme warmth in summer is likely to have greater direct impacts on people’s lives,” Rohde, who is not involved with the Copernicus report, told CNN. “Adding 1.5 degrees Celsius in winter makes for a mild winter but doing it during summer can give rise to unprecedented extremes.” Although Rohde said it is likely that 2023 will be the warmest year on record, it’s unlikely that 2023 as a whole will be 1.5 degrees warmer than pre-industrial times. “The year-to-date average is still below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and we find it unlikely that the rest of 2023 will be warm enough to bring the whole year average above 1.5,” he said. Copernicus scientists noted that as El Niño continues to develop, the world may witness more of these unprecedented temperature breaches. “Even if the climate crisis does not accelerate, but continues on its current trajectory, we will see more days, weeks, months and years with record-breaking temperatures, and other impacts on our Earth system,” Emerton said. “We need to be doing all that we can to reduce emissions and limit future warming.”"

We’re moving. It is the existential threat to humanity.” When pressed again on whether he had actually declared a national emergency, Biden said: “Practically speaking, yes.” While Biden has taken a series of significant legislative and executive steps to combat climate change, he has stopped short of declaring a national emergency, which would unlock sweeping new federal authorities and funds to combat the climate crisis. Climate activists have called on Biden since the earliest days of his presidency to declare a national emergency. Pressed about Biden’s claim, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that Biden was referring to his decision last year to invoke the Defense Production Act to spur production of clean energy technologies. “What the president was talking about is the Defense Production Act. That’s something he did very early on,” Jean-Pierre said on “CNN This Morning.” Defense Production Act authorities are unrelated to a national emergency declaration, which would give Biden power to restrict the export of crude oil and end offshore drilling, among other authorities. A White House official added that Biden “was clear in the interview, as he has been for decades, about the existential threat of climate change and the urgency and priority he places on addressing it.” The interview was done as part of the president’s four-day western swing in which he is attempting to drum up excitement for what he’s done to fight the climate crisis. The president seemed close to declaring a climate emergency in the summer of 2022 after it appeared Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, had tanked the Inflation Reduction Act – Biden’s signature climate and health care bill. In a July 20, 2022, speech in Massachusetts, Biden strongly hinted that he could declare an emergency. “Climate change is an emergency, and in the coming weeks I’m going to use the power I have as president to turn these words into formal, official, government actions through the appropriate proclamations, executive orders and regulatory power that a president possesses,” Biden said during that speech. However, a deal was struck between Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, a little more than a week later on the Inflation Reduction Act and Biden signed the bill into law in August 2022. It includes $369 billion in funding to combat climate change. Since then, Biden has often touted the provisions in the law but has not formally declared a climate emergency. The issue poses a dual challenge for the president and his campaign – selling skeptical Americans on the benefits of his already-enacted climate agenda while balancing the concerns of those who don’t feel like he’s done enough. Most Americans, 57%, disapprove of Biden’s handling of the issue, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released Monday. Climate advocacy groups are seizing on the moment and are pressing Biden to actually declare an emergency. “Approving new fossil fuel projects like the Willow Project is not ‘practically’ declaring a climate emergency,” Sunrise Movement executive director Varshini Prakash said in a statement. “It’s a no-brainer to declare a climate emergency – and if President Biden said we already have, then why not do it now?” Other groups, including the climate group coalition People vs. Fossil Fuels – which represents over 1,200 groups, released a statement saying Biden should “follow through on his rhetoric” by declaring a national emergency that could further speed up deploying clean energy and halting fossil fuel production. “Now that President Biden says he’s ‘practically’ declared a climate emergency, it’s time to do it for real,” People vs. Fossil Fuels, a coalition of over 1,200 groups, said in their statement. CNN’s Ella Nilsen contributed to this report."

Enthusiasm for Biden among Democrats remains soft, according to polls, even as the party lines up behind his reelection bid. The effort this week – with stops in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah – is designed partly to head off frustration and disillusionment among core parts of his coalition over a key issue: Climate change. The issue poses a dual challenge for the president and his campaign – selling skeptical Americans on the benefits of his already-enacted climate agenda while balancing the concerns of those who don’t feel like he’s done enough. Most Americans – 57% – disapprove of Biden’s handling of the issue, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released Monday. Some activists warn his record – which includes both historic investments and a broken promise to stop drilling on federal land – lacks urgency and could impact enthusiasm among young voters. While polls still show Biden more popular among young voters than a potential Republican rival, there are warning signs about their engagement. “President Biden kept his promise on clean energy and broke his promises on fossil fuels. And that’s having a direct impact on his ability to rally young voters to support his reelection,” said Jamie Henn, a climate activist and founder and director of Fossil Free Media. “I think the president has muddied his message on climate by continuing to do things like expand LNG exports and approve massive new fossil fuel projects.” “It’s hard to sell yourself as a climate champion when you’re rubber-stamping new pipelines and drilling in the Arctic,” Henn added. Despite the frustration from some climate activists, the president’s focus this week is on selling what he has done to usher in historic climate investments. Speaking in an interview with The Weather Channel taped Tuesday, Biden sought to underscore what steps he’s taken to curb emissions and boost clean energy. But, in a telling signal of the pressure he’s under to do more, Biden also falsely claimed he has already declared a national emergency on the climate crisis. “I’ve already done that,” Biden said when asked whether he intends to declare a climate emergency. “We’ve conserved more land, we’ve rejoined the Paris Climate Accords, we’ve passed the $368 billion climate control facility. We’re moving. It is the existential threat to humanity.” While Biden has taken a series of significant legislative and executive steps to combat climate change, he has stopped short of declaring a national emergency, which would unlock sweeping new federal authorities and funds to combat the climate crisis. Climate activists have called on Biden since the earliest days of his presidency to declare a national emergency. When pressed again on whether he had actually declared a national emergency, Biden said: “Practically speaking, yes.” Like much of Biden’s agenda, aides say it will take time for voters to fully grasp the impact of sweeping legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, the major climate package passed a year ago. The White House said this week that private sector firms have announced $110 billion in new clean energy investments since the law’s passage. Biden and the White House have sharply criticized Republicans for trying to unravel those accomplishments while the nation endures historic heat waves and extreme weather events. For many climate activists, however, Biden’s investments do not necessarily outweigh his decisions to green-light new drilling and pipeline projects, falling short of the pledge he made as a candidate three years ago. “Young people and an intergenerational coalition do not want more approvals of disastrous oil and gas projects. They’re ready for a transition to a clean energy economy. They’re ready for Biden to commit to his campaign promises,” said Elise Joshi, a climate activist and executive director of Gen-Z for Change. “I cannot predict next year, but what we can predict is that every single time this administration continues to go on a trajectory of approving more oil and gas projects that young people will keep responding the way that they have been recently. And so that that is an inevitability and the administration, I believe, is recognizing that,” she said. Joshi made waves last month when she interrupted a speech delivered by Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, to advocate against approval of new oil and gas projects. Video of the moment was viewed millions of times online – a sharp contrast to Biden’s own event on climate that week, an announcement on heat accommodations that generated little attention. For many young, climate-minded voters, the episode captured an urgency they believe is lacking inside the White House. “That counterprogramming clearly outweighed what the administration was putting out, and it will continue to because that feels like what’s really speaking to the issue, that’s getting to the heart of the matter, whether or not we’re willing to stand up to the fossil fuel industry, cut our dependence,” Henn said. “And as long as the White House is sort of operating in that space, it’s going to continue to be dominated by people who are angry at the administration’s lack of action.” In Arizona on Tuesday, Biden designated nearly a million acres near the Grand Canyon as a national monument, protecting them from uranium mining. He’s also touting the manufacturing and jobs gains made under the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a historic $370 billion toward combatting climate change. Speaking as he made the designation, Biden acknowledged there is “more work ahead” to combat climate change, including wildfires, droughts, and extreme heat. He pointed to what he called “unprecedented” actions toward climate and conservation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and its savings on energy, job creation, and other provisions. “These are investments in our planet, our people, and America itself,” Biden said of the Inflation Reduction Act, warning that “some MAGA extremists in Congress are trying to undo it all” but that he “won’t let that happen.” And he made an argument for US leadership on climate change: “There’s a lot of good that’s going to come from the sacrifices of dealing with taking on the climate crisis. These are investments in our planet, our people, in America itself,” he said. Even as Biden presides over the largest investment in combating climate change in US history, few Americans say in polls they know much about the law that contains the funding, the Inflation Reduction Act. The Washington Post-UMD poll found 71% of Americans have heard “little” or “nothing at all” about the legislation one year after its enactment. The White House downplayed the long-term impact of recent polling. Jean-Pierre said Monday “polls don’t tell the entire story.” “It’s a snapshot of time,” she told reporters aboard Air Force One. “We’ll see, I think, Americans start to feel and see what it is that we have been able to do in Washington, DC” Ali Zaidi, a top Biden climate adviser, instead argued the administration has shown that the US “has become the essential place to drive climate action forward” under Biden’s leadership, pointing to investment in the electric vehicle industry, solar manufacturing, offshore wind and heating and cooling rebates. “We’re making a massive difference in terms of the cost that people absorb on utility bills – cutting those costs,” Zaidi said. “We’re making a massive difference and lifting people up into clean energy jobs. And the president’s translated the greatest risk we face into our greatest economic opportunity.” Still, Zaidi acknowledged the pace of action on climate change hasn’t satisfied everyone. “The American people, and frankly, people all around the world, want everybody to go as fast as they can – faster and faster, picking up the pace of climate action,” he said. “What we’re hearing loud and clear from every sector of the economy and from folks all across the country is ‘Let’s go faster.’ And that’s what the president’s focused on every day.” For many of the country’s largest environmental groups, Biden already represents a better option than any Republican candidate, many of whom still deny the science of climate change altogether. In June, the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, the NRDC Action Fund and NextGen America announced they were endorsing Biden’s bid for reelection, even amid concerns about his approval of new fossil fuel projects in Alaska and West Virginia. The early joint endorsement was meant as a signal of how clear the delineation between Biden and any potential Republican rival would be on climate issues, and a show of support for a record that includes the largest-ever investment in combating climate change. “It is clear that Biden is not only listening to us but is taking robust action to signal to young people across the country that unprecedented change is possible,” NextGen PAC President Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez said in endorsing Biden. The group is a leading youth voter turnout organization. “For the millions of young Americans who flocked to the polls in 2020, his transformative leadership has proven that their votes can make a difference. Young voters are ready to elect Joe Biden again to ensure he finishes the job.” As a candidate in 2020, Biden ran on an ambitious climate agenda that helped drive massive turnout of younger voters, including promising “no more drilling on federal lands, period. Period, period, period.” At a CNN Democratic primary debate in 2020, Biden reiterated his pledge: “No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends.” As president, however, that promise proved difficult to keep. Earlier this year, Biden green-lit the Willow Project, a massive and decadeslong oil drilling venture by ConocoPhillips on Alaska’s North Slope in the National Petroleum Reserve, which is owned by the federal government. The approval came even after more than one million letters written to the White House in protest of the project and a Change.org petition collecting more than 3 million signatures. Biden later said he wanted to block the project but was convinced by administration lawyers that ConocoPhillips would challenge the decision in court and likely prevail. As part of the debt ceiling negotiations earlier this year, Biden also agreed to expedite the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 300-mile-long pipeline that would transport gas from West Virginia’s Marcellus and Utica shale areas to Virginia. The pipeline would cross waterways and federal national forest lands and had been severely delayed amid ongoing legal challenges. What bearing Biden’s actions on climate will have on his political fortunes remains to be seen. While climate activists warn of youth disillusionment, polls show even younger voters ranking other issues – including abortion and inflation – as more important. Still, younger Americans have shown an appetite for greater government intervention when it comes to combating a warming planet. In a Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics poll of 18- to 29-year-olds conducted in March, 50% said they believed government should do more to curb climate change, even at the expense of economic growth. John Della Volpe, the polling director at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, said in a blog post that younger voters were less likely to identify as Democrats and fewer were “likely to believe that politics is a meaningful way to create change.” Those are worrying signs for Democrats. “Nearly every sign that made me confident in historic levels of youth participation in 2018, 2020, and 2022 — is now flashing red,” he wrote. Overall, Biden’s approval rating stands at 44% among Americans aged 18-34, according to a CNN poll released last week. That’s slightly higher than his overall approval of 41%, and the highest of any age cohort. “We have work to do to make sure that Americans know just how transformational these policies are. And they are going to start seeing the benefits of them very soon,” said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action. “Hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in US manufacturing, it’s already starting to create thousands upon thousands of jobs. So as people’s livelihoods start to be impacted in a positive way. By Bidenomics then we’re going to see people really appreciating the transformational potential of these policies.” “The contrast with what we will get if we get four years of a Republican administration couldn’t be worse. The climate crisis right now is borderline apocalyptic,” Moffitt said. “And we have a choice, it could get a lot worse or we could turn the tide and make sure it starts getting better. And a few decades and that difference could not be starker.” CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify that the Natural Resource Defense Council Action Fund endorsed Biden."

Drought, nonnative species and climate change among possible reasons",08/10/2023,                                                 Drought conditions are becoming more extreme and common in Hawaii and other Pacific islands.                                             ,"Rachel Ramirez, CNN","The wildfires that ripped through Hawaii on Tuesday and Wednesday are “unnerving,” and comparable to the landscape-altering wildfires that are common in the West, said Erica Fleishman, director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute at Oregon State University. But Fleishman told CNN she wouldn’t be surprised “if wildfires in many parts of the world that are not accustomed to them become more common over time, or become larger or spread more rapidly.” That’s because the human-caused climate crisis has exacerbated the hot and dry conditions that allow wildfires to ignite and grow in many parts of the planet. Although she said it’s hard to say that the climate crisis is linked to this particular event without a thorough analysis, it is possible to break down the conditions that primed the environment for these wildfires to occur. Follow live updates: Deadly wildfires prompt evacuations in Maui “We can say there are conditions that are consistent with wildfire, wildfire size and expansion that are changing as climate changes,” she said. “And some of the things that we’re seeing with this wildfire in Maui are consistent with some of the trends that are known and projected as climate changes.” While scientists are still trying to fully understand how the climate crisis will affect Hawaii, they have noted that drought will get worse as global temperature increases. As heat sets in, the dried-out land and vegetation can provide fuel for wildfires, which can swiftly turn deadly if strong winds fan the flames into communities. Maui has moderate drought covering more than one-third of the island, with some areas seeing severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. And the areas in drought coincide with some of the fires. Drought conditions are becoming more extreme and common in Hawaii and other Pacific islands, according to the US National Climate Assessment released in 2018. Scientists noted in that report that the rainfall has generally been decreasing in Hawaii over time, with the number of consecutive dry days increasing. As a result, Fleishman said the availability of water has not only decreased for people but also for plants that require more water to thrive. And in parts of Hawaii, there have been drastic changes in plant species. A 2018 report from the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization found that humans have introduced nonnative, fire-prone grasses and shrubs to the islands, which has allowed wildfire threats to increase exponentially. Nonnative species, which are critical fire ignitions, now cover nearly a quarter of Hawaii’s total land area. “My understanding is that in Maui, as in much of the Western United States, there’s been a long-term trend toward an increased cover of nonnative grasses and those are highly flammable,” Fleishman said. “And so many of these grasses, they do very well after fire. They tend to expand after fire, so you have plants that are more likely to ignite and to allow a wildfire to spread rapidly.” Wind patterns are another contributing factor that may have some fingerprints of climate change, she said. High winds, such as the ones that helped fan the flames in Maui, are more likely going to dry out vegetation, air and soil, which could spark wildfires. “When those strong winds hit, if you already have the heat and the dryness and if you have a spark, a wildfire becomes more likely to grow rapidly,” she added. Fleishman said she is hopeful that these places will have some time to prepare for a hotter and drier future. “Worldwide, extreme weather is becoming more common,” she said. “But people have a little bit of room to plan for protecting livelihoods, protecting people’s health and protecting them in ways that are equitable.”"

","Eric Zerkel, CNN","Climate change-fueled extreme heat will significantly increase the risk of heat-related illness for the millions of people who visit Grand Canyon National Park each year, a new National Park Service study found. Researchers used visitation, heat-related illness, temperature and humidity data at the Grand Canyon over a six-year period from 2004 to 2009 to determine a heat-illness risk baseline, and then used climate models to predict how that risk would change in the future under two scenarios: a moderate and high increase of planet-warming pollution. They found the rate of heat illness per 100,000 visitors increased across both scenarios. It would increase by up to 137% by 2100 under the highest emission scenario, they found, resulting in up to 254 heat-related illnesses in the park each year during the six-month peak visitation season. “Even under the best-case scenarios there’s a lot of future risk coming,” Danielle Buttke, a National Park Service epidemiologist and one of the study’s authors, told CNN. “This is truly a human health risk – every degree of warming matters, every amount of emitted carbon matters and every action we can take to lessen our personal impact and advocate for climate action is going to save human lives.” The study highlights the growing health risk of the more frequent, volatile, intense and exceptionally long-lasting heat waves. National parks have already warmed twice as fast as the rest of the US because of human-caused climate change, a 2018 study found. “Climate change is the greatest public health threat of the century,” Buttke told CNN. Heat “really does impact every aspect of our lives in some shape or form and that’s why climate change is less about changes to the environment than it is about changes to our daily lives and well-being.” Heat illness includes heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and more, and can lead to hospitalization and even death. Heat is suspected to have killed 16 people at Grand Canyon National Park since 2007 – more than any other national park – according to preliminary heat mortality data provided to CNN. Suspected heat deaths are on the rise nationally and at national parks amid multiple exceptionally long-lasting, record-shattering heat waves. Buttke said the study’s heat illness projections could be underestimated because current warming and emissions “closely track” to the worst-case scenario and visitation could go up and put more people at risk. The heat illness data used in the study only took into account people treated in the park and not those who didn’t seek treatment or sought it elsewhere. “It’s possible these are underestimates because we’re already at the upper level of what our model projects,” Buttke told CNN. “What we’ve seen in the news in recent weeks and months with this summer is that we’re already experiencing much faster and higher impacts than a lot of the models have predicted, so it’s very possible our study is underestimating future risk.” Notably, the study found the risk of heat-related illness was most pronounced during the cooler months during the peak season from April to September, something Buttke said highlights the risk of not being able to anticipate and prepare for the unpredictable nature of extreme heat in a warming world. “I think that’s really the take home: The absolute temperature was less important than how expected that temperature was,” Buttke said. “It’s really about whether or not people expected high temperatures during that time.” Even though heat illness increased during these cooler months, Buttke said it showed that behavioral adaptations, like wearing proper clothing, drinking plenty of water and avoiding the outdoors during the peak heat of the day, could have a substantial impact on reducing these heat-related illnesses and that the park service could use this insight to improve communication ahead of “unexpected” heat waves. The volatility and danger of heat is something parks and people will have to prepare for as long as emissions and warming continue on its current pace. “It tells us so much of the impact of climate change is the variability and the unexpected nature,” Buttke said. “We evolved under a climate that was very predictable and climate change is taking us into a new climate that is very unpredictable and that’s where the greatest risk exists.”"

There have been no tropical storms in the Atlantic basin in nearly a month, and ...","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Record-high ocean temperatures are setting the stage for an active Atlantic hurricane season with explosive tropical development, but just one thing is missing: storms. There have been no tropical storms in the Atlantic basin in nearly a month, and none so far this year have come close to the United States. But the busiest stretch of hurricane season kicks off in less than a week. And with ocean heat running high, experts are urging people to get their safety plans in place and prepare for tropical trouble that could start within the next couple of weeks. A growing expert consensus is now forecasting an uptick in hurricane activity. An updated outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday called for an above-average hurricane season – an increase from the near-normal forecast it released in May. “We have increased the chance for above normal activity to 60% from 30%,” Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in a news release. “The chances of a below normal season are now at only 15%.” Rosencrans told CNN there was “moderate confidence” conditions will become more conducive for tropical development within a week or two. And forecasters are honing in on the development potential in the open Atlantic during this time and into September, a forecast that lines up with typical climatology. NOAA forecasters join other experts in the field that have recently increased their hurricane risk outlooks, including researchers at Colorado State University. The forecasts are leaning on several climatological factors, but also on exceptionally warm oceans, which provide storms the fuel needed to explode in strength and even undergo rapid intensification. NOAA said sea surface temperatures were warmer than anticipated, and a major factor in increasing the odds of an active season. “Considering those factors, the updated outlook calls for more activity, so we urge everyone to prepare now for the continuing season,” Rosencrans said. Global ocean temperatures are at their highest levels on record. This is especially the case in the Atlantic, where sea surface temperatures are much above average in areas where hurricanes typically form. Notably, sea surface temperatures in parts of the Gulf of Mexico are in the middle 80s to low 90s Fahrenheit – well above the 80 degrees needed to sustain tropical storm development. Water temperatures have even recently climbed above 100 degrees in shallower water closer to the Florida coast. Even with the abundance of very warm water, no tropical development has occurred in the Atlantic since Hurricane Don dissipated in late July. Despite the lack of US impacts so far, there have been five named storms, putting this season slightly above the climatological normal for tropical activity. And there have been recent signs that the tropical Atlantic could soon spring to life. Several thunderstorm areas have come close to developing, only to be torn apart by two things: wind shear, which is the change in strength in winds in different levels of the atmosphere, and dry air, which can cut off a storm’s lifeblood – its thunderstorm activity. Wind shear and dry air have largely won out over warm ocean water over the past few weeks, suppressing hurricane activity. This is not altogether unusual as wind shear is typically strong at the start of hurricane season and gradually begins to ease through July and into August. But just how much of a reduction in wind shear and dry air occurs headed into the typical peak of hurricane season is in question. Notably, El Niño is present and growing in the Pacific Ocean – an ocean and weather pattern that typically promotes an increase in wind shear and makes Atlantic hurricane seasons less active. Rosencrans said El Niño’s influence had yet to arrive in the Atlantic, but could do so in September. He said there were already signs of wind shear lessening over an area in the Atlantic where storms typically form and that lower than normal wind shear was expected for the season and factored into expectations for an increase in activity. When wind shear lessens and dry air exits, hurricane season will be off to the races with extreme ocean temperatures ready to fuel stronger storms. Take last year for instance: Two storms – Alex and Colin – had already impacted the US by this time last year, but Colin’s dissipation was quickly followed by a lengthy inactive stretch where no additional storms formed in July or August. But once September arrived, along with it came a quick uptick in activity that culminated in devastating Hurricane Ian slamming the US to end the month. Tropical activity spikes across the Atlantic from mid-August to mid-October due to a relative minimum in wind shear and a relative maximum in sea surface temperatures. This period alone accounts for an astounding 96% of all major hurricane days in a season, according to NOAA. Even if tropical activity doesn’t pick up considerably in the next few weeks, any storm that does manage to form over very warm water with no wind shear to inhibit it has the potential to explode in strength and turn dangerous fast. And with hot water in place near highly populated areas of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, disaster can quickly strike if a tropical system is able to tap into that abundant energy."

That’s the highest percentage of Americans feeling average highs in the triple digits so far this summer. The agency’s Heat and Health tracker examines where Americans are experiencing extreme heat conditions so communities can prepare for — and respond to — such events. While the South and West have experienced the highest temperatures over the last two months, by the end of July, temperatures exceeding 90 degrees had spread across the South, Midwest — and even the north central United States, including the Dakotas and Montana. During the last week of July, nearly 155 million Americans saw weekly average high temperatures above 90 degrees, 28 million of whom saw average highs topping 100 degrees. In the first week of August, the number of people feeling three-digit temperatures jumped to 38 million, mostly in Texas, Oklahoma and southern Arizona, including Phoenix. More than 53 million Americans across 473 counties are expected to experience dangerous levels of heat for at least five days in August, data from the CDC and the US Census Bureau show. Sixty-four of those counties, scattered throughout the South and West, may see dangerous temperatures for 10 days or more."

","Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN","A bedrock federal law designed to protect the environment and empower local communities is being weaponized to block progress on climate change, infrastructure and housing. The battle over New York City’s landmark congestion price plan is the latest example. After more than 50 years of efforts to implement a toll program that would slash greenhouse emissions from cars and reduce congestion in lower Manhattan, the plan cleared a milestone in May, when the federal government signed off on the release of an environmental assessment. Then, last month, New Jersey sued to block the plan, citing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 (NEPA). The law requires federal agencies to give a detailed assessment of the environmental impact before approving projects that could significantly alter the environmental landscape. New Jersey said the government’s analysis, which spanned more than 4,000 pages and included feedback from 80,000 public comments, was not comprehensive enough. Congestion taxes have been tested in major cities around the world and proven to be successful, if initially controversial. European cities like London and Stockholm have seen a range of benefits, including a reduction in congestion, a drop in carbon dioxide pollution and lower rates of pediatric acute asthma cases. But New Jersey said the Federal Highway Administration failed to adequately consider the impact that congestion pricing would have on diverting traffic to the state and harming its environment. Lawmakers want the government to conduct a more thorough analysis — which could take years. Advocates of NEPA reform say it’s ironic that New York City’s congestion tax — a project intended to curb greenhouse emissions and boost mass transit — is being scuttled via a law specifically designed to improve the environment. In the United States, conservatives have pushed to weaken environmental regulations for years. But now, more and more Democrats in Congress and left-leaning researchers are embracing the idea of streamlining the review process. They say they want to protect the environment, but that the process needs to be modernized for the climate-change era and government isn’t acting fast enough. Some of these critics on the left say environmental review has become a labyrinth of paperwork and litigation to stop or delay key clean energy projects, raise construction costs and create uncertainty for businesses. The Democrats’ sweeping Inflation Reduction Act contained billions of dollars in tax credits designed to turbocharge energy, especially clean energy, but there are concerns that NEPA procedures will create hurdles to build these projects. “Once you take a broader climate change approach, environmental review becomes a bad tool to helping the environment,” said Howard Slatkin, executive director at Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a progressive nonprofit research and education organization in New York City. “It punishes all of the things that smart growth offers,” he said, including density, housing development and public transit. “A tool that was built to stop the bulldozing of trees is getting in the way of our climate future,” he said. Reform advocates say other recent lawsuits — efforts to block expanding the number of students admitted to University of California, Berkeley; single-family housing zoning reform in Minneapolis; and affordable housing for seniors in New York City — show how environmental review procedures have become a barrier in some cases. While projects drag on or get canceled, carbon emissions rise and the housing shortage worsens. The National Environmental Policy Act, passed by Congress in 1969 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon on January 1, 1970, was considered the Magna Carta of environmental protection law. Congress enacted NEPA, as well as the Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act and other foundational environmental laws in the 1970s in response to growing environmental awareness and revolts over urban renewal projects like highway construction that displaced communities. During the New Deal and post-World War II era, newly created federal and state agencies grew, rolling out massive public works projects. “But by the 1960s, you see a backlash both from emerging environmental movements and from communities that feel agencies are riding roughshod over them,” said Paul Sabin, who teaches US environmental history at Yale University and is the author of “Public Citizens: The Attack on Big Government and the Remaking of American Liberalism.” “NEPA emerged at a time where people thought that government was doing too much,” Sabin said. “It reflected an idea that we could slow change.” The goal of NEPA was to require federal agencies to take environmental considerations into account during their planning and decision-making process — a “look before you leap” approach. It also gave local communities a greater voice in government decisions. States also enacted their own equivalents of NEPA, known as “little NEPAs.” But critics say that, in practice, NEPA and state-level versions have drifted far beyond their original purpose. While NEPA was initially intended to require review of “major” federal actions that could “significantly” affect the human and natural environment, more than 12,000 comprehensive environmental reviews are now conducted annually. But around 98% of substantive NEPA reviews apply to projects that do not have a significant environmental impact, according to Eli Dourado, a senior research fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University. “When you impose these big, procedural requirements on basically everything, it privileges the status quo,” he said. “That’s good if you start with an environmentally pristine world, but it makes new things incredibly hard to do” These reviews have ballooned in size and often add months or years of delay to badly needed projects, including clean energy projects. On average, a full environmental analysis now takes 4.5 years to complete. The environmental review process has “metastasized well beyond what anyone intended it to be,” Dourado said. “To me, it’s clearly dysfunctional.” The need to reform the environmental review process has become a bipartisan issue in recent years. But there are tensions between the competing goals of protecting the environment and also speeding up major infrastructure projects. “This is a balancing between the need for speed and the need to protect core environmental values and the interest of communities,” said Elgie Holstein, a senior director for strategic planning at the Environmental Defense Fund and a former energy adviser to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. There is disagreement among Democrats and Republicans about how far to go, and a split has emerged within the environmental advocacy movement over whether to support changes to NEPA. In 2020, President Donald Trump’s administration proposed a dramatic weakening of NEPA that would end the requirement for federal agencies to take climate change into account when they assess the environmental impacts of projects. President Joe Biden’s administration scrapped this proposal, but last month proposed a new rule to speed up permitting for clean energy and other infrastructure projects under NEPA. The proposals emerged from the bipartisan deal to raise the debt ceiling. The rule would designate a lead agency for each project review and set stricter deadlines and page limits for assessments. It would also mean that projects with clear, long-lasting positive impacts do not require comprehensive environmental impact analysis. Projects like enabling hazardous fuel reduction in an area with high wildfire risk would be more easily excluded from environmental review, the administration said. Some environmental groups believe these reforms are needed to advance clean energy progress and other goals. But other groups fear changes will undermine key environmental protections. “Most of the environmental community is, at a minimum, leery of these proposals and very concerned about the possibility of the fervor for building out new energy infrastructure running roughshod over NEPA,” Holstein said. While the Environmental Defense Fund supports the Biden administration’s reforms to NEPA, it’s against a draconian rollback of environmental review, he said. “We don’t want to throw out the baby with the bathwater.” CNN’s Ella Nilsen contributed to this article."

","Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN","A year after Democrats passed their sweeping $750 billion climate and health care law, it’s leading to a surge of clean energy projects and job creation, according to a recent Bank of America report. More than 270 new clean energy projects have been announced since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with private investments totaling $132 billion, according to the report. These investments are expected to be accompanied by more than 86,000 jobs, including 50,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. The Inflation Reduction Act “is not only working to strengthen supply chains but also to boost domestic manufacturing and create new jobs,” Bank of America said in the report. The White House is attempting to keep focus on the one-year anniversary of the lnflation Reduction Act’s passage this week with an assortment of senior officials traveling across the country to mark the occasion – selling the bill to voters, a White House official says. A recent poll found most voters still don’t know what’s in the law. The nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package, which passed on a party-line vote, was the largest climate investment in US history. Its goal is to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. Inflation has cooled over the past year, but it doesn’t have much to do with the law. The bill contained many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more consumers to switch to clean electricity to power their homes and vehicles. Close to half of private investment went to EVs and battery production, while the rest went to renewable energy like solar, wind and nuclear projects, grid investments, and other projects, according to Bank of America. The law is driving the most clean energy job growth in Georgia, South Carolina, Nevada and Tennessee. The Inflation Reduction Act’s “impact is becoming more evident,” Bank of America said. The law is expected to “play a vital role in incentivizing investments and creating jobs” in 2024 and 2025, too. President Joe Biden is traveling to a clean energy manufacturing company in Wisconsin Tuesday and holding an event celebrating the anniversary back at the White House Wednesday. It comes after a Washington Post-UMD poll out last week found 71% of Americans have heard “little” or “nothing at all” about the legislation one year after its enactment. Last week, Biden lamented the choice of the law’s name. “The Inflation Reduction Act – I wish I hadn’t called it that, because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it does to do with dealing with providing for alternatives that generate economic growth,” he told donors, according to a transcript provided by the White House. CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this article."

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. The Northwest US has mostly been able to dodge major heat this summer, but it has arrived with a vengeance and could help to stoke and start wildfires, including in parts of western Canada where hundreds of wildfires are raging out of control. People across parts of Washington and Oregon will face a rare “extreme” level of heat risk through Wednesday with temperatures expected to run as much as 20 degrees above normal. The “extreme HeatRisk” is the highest possible risk level for heat, akin to a “high risk” for tornadoes. It is meant to warn of significant heat impacts, including heat-related illness, and urge preparation. The temperatures are forecast to break records: Portland could hit 107 degrees Monday, which would break its old daily record and tie its hottest recorded temperature for August. Eugene, Oregon, is also forecast to hit 107 degrees Monday, which would shatter its previous daily record of 101 degrees. All told, more 230 heat records could be broken on Monday and Tuesday across the country. Get your local forecast here In addition to the high heat, red flag warnings signaling the increased fire danger cover much of western Oregon and Washington. Low humidity levels and gusty winds will make for prime fire conditions. Roughly 2,600 firefighters are out battling the seven large fires burning across Oregon and Washington. Even small fires, like the Lookout Fire in Lane County, Oregon, can cause issues fast. The 200-acre fire forced evacuations Sunday night, one of two fires forcing evacuations in the county. Weather conditions will cause the fires to easily spread and allow new ones to ignite. The hot conditions are reaching as far north as Canada which is in the middle of its worst fire season on record. Heat warnings are currently in effect for southern sections of the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. The hot, dry conditions also fed more fires across British Columbia, where more than 375 active fires are currently burning. More than half of those have ignited in just the last 24 hours. The exceptional heat also hasn’t let up across the South. The entirety of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are under heat alerts. Excessive heat warnings, which is the highest level of heat alert, include major cities like Houston, New Orleans, Atlanta and Jacksonville, Florida. Heat indexes will be 110 to 120 degrees across these cities. Some temporary heat relief is coming for parts of the South, minus the Gulf Coast and Florida. A cold front will push through the region tonight, dropping high temperatures for a large chunk of the heat oppressed back into the upper 80s to low 90s – a much more seasonal forecast. The low 90s are still hot but will feel like a temporary break from the dangerous heat before it builds back in again by the end of the week."

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Thousands of heat records broken. Oceans at hot tub levels. Mass coral bleaching. Extraordinary wildfires. Earth’s hottest month on record. It has been a summer of unprecedented heat across the globe, the alarming effect of a rapidly warming world kindled by fossil fuels. But despite decades of warnings from scientists who have long predicted that human-caused climate change would bring dire consequences, news organizations are still struggling to connect the dots in their daily coverage. That is according to several climate experts who spoke to Reliable Sources and leveled criticism at how the crisis sweeping the planet is being covered by major media institutions. “The media’s climate reporting has improved recently, but most news organizations are still not giving the accelerating crisis anything like the amount and urgency of coverage the story deserves,” said Mark Hertsgaard, the executive director of the global journalist consortium Covering Climate Now. Hertsgaard isn’t alone in the sentiment. Climate change coverage has progressed leaps and bounds in recent years. Newsrooms have become far more cognizant about tying extreme weather events, like flash flooding and heat waves, to the larger trend. But still, there is considerable room for improvement. “Especially in the United States, most TV news reports on the ferocious heat and other weather extremes afflicting millions of people this summer have not even mentioned the words ‘climate change,’” Hertsgaard said. “The science is unequivocal on that connection and leaving it out leaves audiences not just uninformed but misinformed.” The unprecedented wind-whipped wildfire that devastated the island of Maui last week, killing more than 100 people, has received high volumes of attention from major media outlets, which have gone to remarkable lengths to gather reporting from the scene. But, according to research from the progressive watchdog Media Matters, only 4% of television news segments about the disaster, during a two-day period starting on August 9, tied the catastrophe to climate change. More alarmingly, perhaps, of the only eight segments that mentioned climate change during this particular window on television, all of them came from CNN and MSNBC. CNN mentioned climate change three times and MSNBC five times, according to Media Matters. ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News did not tie the fires to climate change in any of the 35 segments that aired. (Of course, it’s worth noting that many of these outlets have been drawing this connection on their digital platforms.) Michael Mann, the presidential distinguished professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania, told Reliable Sources that he fears news organizations do not cover the climate crisis enough, outside extreme weather events. “Many media outlets still treat climate as a niche issue, giving it very little coverage except when an unprecedented bout of extreme weather takes place, or a major new report comes out,” he said. News organizations could take a page out of their playbook for covering politics, where singular events are often tied to broader trends. When covering the various indictments against Donald Trump, journalists are quick to point out that they are part of a broader campaign the disgraced former president and his allies waged against the US democratic system. Max Boykoff, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, agreed. Boykoff argued that wall-to-wall coverage of Trump-related developments “displaces stories that deserve attention about climate change and global warming.” Broadcast news outlets, he suggested, should treat the issue as a far more grave threat, launching shows devoted to covering climate change and its far-reaching effects on everyday life. “The best climate coverage pairs human stories with the stories in the data and science. It informs the audience, teaching them something new while taking them on a journey,”  said Peter Girard, director of communications at Climate Central. And while there is still deep political polarization and misinformation around the causes of climate change, with polls showing Republicans far less likely to believe that human actions are the root cause, reporting on the extreme effects unfolding before our very eyes — and not in the distant future — can make clear the connection and inform audiences on the critical issue that requires urgent action to avert far worse consequences. “People are realizing that climate change is driving many of the changes they are experiencing in their local community — from crazier weather and worsening air quality to more coastal floods and changing planting seasons — but they have questions,” Girard said. “Why is this happening? What can be done to change things? The media has an opportunity to dive deeper into the story and answer their audience’s questions.”"

","Hafsa Khalil, CNN","The world is facing an “unprecedented water crisis” driven by soaring demand and the accelerating climate crisis, according to a new report. A quarter of the world’s population currently faces “extremely high water stress” each year, with an additional 1 billion people expected to be affected by 2050, according the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas published Wednesday. Extremely high water stress means countries are using almost all the water they have – at least 80% of their renewable supply, according to the report, which is published every four years. The report found that 25 countries, representing 25% of the global population, experience extremely high water stress each year, with Bahrain, Cyprus, Kuwait, Lebanon and Oman the five most affected. Even a short-term drought could put these places at risk of running out of water. “Water is arguably our most important resource on the planet and yet we’re not managing it in a way that reflects that,” said Samantha Kuzma, Aqueduct data lead from WRI’s water program and a report author. “I’ve been working in water for close to 10 years, and unfortunately, the story has been the same almost the entire 10 years,” Kuzma told CNN. Globally, demand for water has more than doubled since 1960, and the report projects that it will rise by a further 20 to 25% by 2050. Increased water demand stems from a range of factors, including growing populations and the demands of industries such as agriculture, along with unsustainable water use policies and a lack of investment in infrastructure. In the Middle East and North Africa, the world’s most water-stressed regions, the entire population will live with extremely high water stress by mid-century, the report predicts, affecting drinking water supplies, damaging industries and potentially fueling political conflict. The biggest change in water demand will occur in sub-Saharan Africa according to the report, which projects a 163% increase in water demand by 2050. “One look at sub-Saharan Africa, we see demand for water skyrocketing,” Kuzma said, mainly for domestic water use and crop irrigation. In North America and Europe, water demand has plateaued, helped by investment in water use efficiency measures. But that doesn’t mean parts of these regions aren’t affected. In the US, six states experience extremely high water stress, according to the report. Six of the seven states in the Colorado River Basin, including Arizona and New Mexico, are in the top 10 most water-stressed states in the US. Water resources also extend beyond country borders, Kuzma said. “We’re all impacted if water stress is essentially turning off the tap and preventing different countries from producing certain commodities.” And, under it all, climate change is worsening the crisis. “Water is how climate change most directly impacts people around the world,” said Charles Iceland, global director of water with WRI’s Food, Forests, Water, and the Ocean Program. Climate change fuels increasingly severe and prolonged droughts and heat waves, which make water supplies much less reliable. A lack of water also makes it harder for people to survive these extremes. Even if the world manages to limit warming to 1.3 to 2.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels – an “optimistic” scenario according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – an additional 1 billion people are expected to live in extremely high water stress conditions by 2050,  according to the report. Water stress costs lives, threatens food security and causes energy outages. The report suggests various measures to prevent water stress spilling into a water crisis. These include nature-based measures, such as preserving and restoring wetlands and forests, farmers adopting more efficient watering techniques such as drip irrigation, and policymakers focusing on energy sources that don’t rely so heavily on water, such as solar and wind. Places like Las Vegas and Singapore have shown it’s possible to manage very scarce water resources through policies such as wastewater treatment and reuse and removing water-thirsty plants, the report authors wrote. But globally, action is lagging, according to the report. Dieter Gerten, research group leader at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who was not involved in the report, told CNN that the findings bring home the scale of the challenge the world faces and the need to urgently implement measures to tackle it. “This report once more reminds us that the sheer sum of acute and chronic water stress symptoms – which now affect large parts of the Earth and the life of billions of people – leads us to the brink of a global water crisis.”"

","Caolán Magee, CNN","Warming global temperatures are dangerous for people in many ways, but they’re proving ideal for one type of animal: venomous snakes. As Australia’s east coast experiences one of its warmest winters on record, snake season appears to have started early. The Australian Reptile Park has issued an “urgent warning” for people to be on the look out for venomous snakes. A rise in temperatures, coupled with winter rainfall, is the perfect environment for venomous snakes to become more active, the Australian Reptile Park said in a statement. Snakes tend to “brumate” over the winter, a state similar to hibernation during which they become less active and often seek out a place to hide until temperatures start to climb again. Usually this doesn’t happen until September. But the heat is enticing snakes to emerge sooner than usual and snake catchers have reported a significant increase in call outs  – a phenomenon rarely seen at this time of year, according to the Australian Reptile Park. “It’s important that all Australians know that [snakes] do not go out of their way to harm people. Snake bites mostly occur when people are trying to catch or kill the snake, so if you don’t do either of those things, there’s a greater chance that you’ll be okay!” Billy Collett, operations manager at the park, said in a statement. But he urged people to learn how to deal with snake bites, which can be fatal in as little as 30 minutes. These include keeping bite victims calm, removing jewelry and watches and bandaging the whole limb, not just the bite area. He also recommended people keep backyards clear of stacks of firewood and other materials which can creating ideal habitats for snakes. As the world continues to burn planet-warming fossil fuels, and global temperatures soar, Australia’s winters have been steadily warming. Last month was the fourth warmest July on record for New South Wales, data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology shows. Across the country, temperatures were nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year. In the UK, which this year experienced its hottest June on record by a significant margin, rising temperatures are also affecting its snake population – specifically pet snakes. The animal non-profit the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) said more snakes in captivity are breaking free from their enclosures due to the warming climate."

That’s a 10-month high and represents a 31-cent increase from just a month ago. The summertime gas price spike has been driven by a combination of easing recession fears, production cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia and extreme heat that has knocked offline some refinery activity. The historic heatwaves could cause even more trouble by potentially setting the stage for powerful hurricanes. “The major risk,” according to analysts at Citigroup, is that global warming and record-high ocean temperatures diminish the El Niño wind shear impacts that prevent Atlantic Ocean storms from entering the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf Coast is home to major US refineries and the region is a key hub for energy exports, including liquefied natural gas. That’s not to mention vast offshore Gulf of Mexico oil production. “Two Category 3 or higher hurricanes landing on US shores could massively disrupt supplies for not weeks but months,” Citigroup analysts wrote in a client note on Thursday. In the Pacific Ocean, Hilary strengthened into a hurricane on Thursday and is expected to rapidly turn into a Category 4 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center. However, this hurricane should have limited impact on energy supplies because it’s on track to threaten California, not the refinery hub of the US Gulf Coast. For consumers, the good news is that, outside of the risk of a bad hurricane season, Citi is bearish on oil prices. The Wall Street bank’s baseline forecast is that oil prices will drop in the coming months, a scenario that would cool gas prices. Citi cited “far more robust” oil supplies this year and next than what most anticipate combined with “far softer” demand for energy. US oil prices are on track to snap a seven-week winning streak. Crude climbed 1.3% to $80.65 a barrel Thursday morning. However, the current jump in gas prices threatens to undercut some of the progress made on the inflation front and cause even more political problems for a White House especially sensitive to this issue. President Joe Biden’s economic approval numbers were weak even when gas prices were plunging. The surge to 10-month highs won’t help. Drivers in 12 states plus Washington, DC, are already paying an average of $4 or more for gas, including Colorado, Arizona and Illinois, according to AAA. Indiana, Pennsylvania and New York aren’t far behind. “It’s something we certainly keep a close eye on,” a White House official told CNN earlier this week. “The president is committed to lowering prices at the pump for Americans and maintaining a stable and secure energy supply.” When asked by CNN’s Erin Burnett about rising gas prices, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday noted that prices are well below their peak from last year. That’s true. At $3.88 a gallon, the national average price for regular gas is $1.14 below the record high of $5.02 in June 2022. Gas prices are also still cheaper than a year ago — though not by much. As recently as Memorial Day and July 4th, consumers were saving big on gas prices when measured against the same point last year. But that trend has been stopped in its tracks. Gas prices are now just six cents below this point last summer, according to AAA. “Energy markets are volatile and gas prices can fluctuate,” the White House official told CNN. “Fluctuations like this aren’t uncommon in the summer ‘driving season’ due to higher gasoline demand.” The White House official also acknowledged the role that heatwaves have had on prices. “This year, extreme heat is also impacting certain refineries, which only highlights the urgency of building a clean energy economy going forward,” the official told CNN."

","Thomas Page, CNN","Out in the Sahara Desert, in one of the most inhospitable environments imaginable, a natural solution to the climate crisis is growing ­– and at a rapid rate. London-based startup Brilliant Planet has leased 6,100 hectares of land outside the remote coastal town of Akhfenir in southern Morocco, wedged between the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Sahara to the south. And it’s using it to cultivate algae. Algae absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide and emits oxygen via photosynthesis, and has been doing so since before the first land plants ever existed. Brilliant Planet’s CEO Adam Taylor says the company has developed a way to grow algae at exponential rates starting in a beaker in a lab and ending in 12,000-square-meter pools of locally-sourced seawater. Taylor says the process mimics a natural algae bloom, and a test tube of algae can multiply to fill 16 of these giant pools – the equivalent of 77 Olympic-sized swimming pools – in just 30 days. The algae is extracted from the water then pumped up a 10-story tower and sprayed into the desert air. In the roughly 30 seconds it takes to reach the ground, hot air dries the biomass out, leaving hypersaline algae flakes which can be collected and shallow buried, sequestering their carbon for thousands of years, the company claims. “Nature-based solutions are a great way of removing carbon,” Taylor told CNN, arguing that deserts are an under-utilized environment. “It does not cost a lot of money to rent the desert (and) governments are enthusiastic to have any economic activity,” he continued. What’s more, “You’re not competing with farms, you’re not competing with forests, you’re out of the way, not bothering people,” he said. The UN’s climate change panel the IPCC estimates that hundreds of billions of tons of carbon dioxide would need to be removed from the atmosphere by 2100 to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The best way to do that is hotly debated. Many carbon capture solutions have been proposed, the most headline-grabbing being direct air capture. The technology, which has received multi-billion dollar backing by the US Department of Energy, uses machines with filters to scrub carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which can then be stored underground or used in materials like concrete. Yet the technology remains small-scale, while its detractors say it’s expensive, energy-intensive and unproven. Other solutions, such as tree planting, biochar and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage have sought to make use of the natural carbon-capturing abilities of the planet’s flora. Each have their pros and cons, including the infrastructure required and the length of sequestration. Taylor claims that Brilliant Planet’s solution can permanently remove 30 times more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per hectare per year than a typical European forest. In an email, Fatna Ikrame El Fanne, an environmental engineer and co-founder of grassroots movement Youth For Climate Morocco, described the use of algae as “a new and promising strategy” that “exemplifies an innovative use of natural process to address an urgent global issue.” Morocco’s geographical characteristics make it a suitable environment, she said. “There are enormous desert regions in the country that might be converted for carbon capture and storage projects,” she added. Nevertheless, El Fanne expressed caution. “Microalgae production on a large scale might damage local ecosystems, strain water resources, and modify habitats,” she said. “Sustainable land management approaches, efficient water consumption, ecological restoration, regulatory compliance, community participation, and continuing monitoring are required.” Brilliant Planet’s pilot site covers three hectares, and will be expanding to a 30-hectare demonstration facility at Akhfenir next year and the company has plans for a 200-hectare then a 1,000-hectare farm at the site. A 1,000-hectare facility represents a baseline commercial site that would create around 250 jobs, mostly for skilled local workers, said Taylor. Brilliant Planet plans to sell carbon credits to fund its operation and expansion. In July, it announced its first major deal, with global technology company Block, to remove 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide by 2027. Carbon offsetting schemes are growing in popularity but the industry has been accused of a lack of transparency and regulation, with dubious effectiveness. Most carbon credits purchased are in the form of avoidance (such as avoiding deforestation) rather than carbon removal, said Robert Höglund, an independent climate advisor. Höglund co-founded cdr.fyi, a platform that monitors the global market for carbon dioxide removal. Of the more than 4 million tons of CO2 purchased by companies listed (including Block), just over 2% have been removed to date – but that’s not necessarily a cause for concern, he said. “The primary reason to buy carbon removal today is to further innovate and help the nascent sector to grow to meet its future need, not to maximize the number of tons removed today,” Höglund explained. “By pre-purchasing tons from start-ups, first-of-a-kind facilities can be built and the methods tested out.” Taylor hopes the tangible, weighable algae flakes will make Brilliant Planet’s model attractive. Brilliant Planet has received over $26 million in investment to date and another funding round is scheduled for later this year. Its goal is to remove one million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year – the same annual emissions of 217,000 cars ­– by the end of the decade. That would take 10,000 hectares across multiple sites and investment of around $1 billion, said Taylor. The CEO is undaunted by either figure. “Globally, we’ve identified about half a million square kilometers of flat desert-ocean land where it works,” Taylor said, adding that the company hopes to set up in Namibia next. Even so, there’s an acknowledgement that one company can’t do it all – and can’t go it alone. “We are part of a cohort of probably 40 to 50 weird and wonderful ideas of how people can remove carbon from the atmosphere,” Taylor said, calling for “a Manhattan Project-type attitude” to tackling carbon capture. Whether algae is the solution the world needs remains to be seen. But the idea’s growing on people."

","Ava Loomar, CNN","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. As the climate warms, scientists have suggested that “time-traveling pathogens” unleashed by thawing Arctic permafrost may pose a risk to modern ecosystems. Permafrost is a hard layer of frozen ground made of soil, sand and rocks in high-latitude or high-altitude areas such as Greenland, Alaska, Siberia, the Tibetan Plateau and northern Canada. This icy layer traps microbes that remain dormant for long periods of time — but a warming planet could create conditions suitable for these pathogens to return from the past, according to new research. To better understand the possible ecological effects, an international team of researchers digitally modeled the interactions between an ancient virus and modern bacteria in a study published July 27 in the journal PLOS Computational Biology. Through tens of thousands of iterations, the study team tracked how the virus affected species diversity of a bacterial community. About 1% of the ancient viruses caused major disruptions to the digital ecosystems. The pathogen either increased diversity by up to 12% or, conversely, decreased species diversity by 32%. The viral invaders not only survived but evolved over time, throwing the system off-balance. Researchers used a software called Avida to simulate whether pathogens would be successful at infiltrating an ecosystem. In a two-dimensional grid, bacterial organisms interacted with their environment to compete for energy and space. Competitors who found their niche could reproduce and live on through the cycles. In doing so, there were slight errors in reproduction that created genetic diversity, resulting in a more complex ecosystem. When the virus entered this environment, like any other parasite, it was only able to get energy by leaching off suitable bacterial hosts. The hosts were then unable to receive the energy they needed to survive or reproduce and, subsequently, died. Does this mean that nearly one-third of humans and other living organisms will soon be at risk of dying from a reawakened viral disease? No, but lead author Giovanni Strona and coauthor Corey Bradshaw said the findings add yet another layer of concern to the risks from an ever-warming climate. In the past two decades, more research has been dedicated to understanding the consequences of permafrost melt in Arctic regions, such as a January 2022 NASA study that investigated the effects of carbon release during abrupt thawing events and Jean-Michel Claverie’s decade-long look into potentially infectious pathogens locked in permafrost. Claverie, a professor emeritus of medicine and genomics at the Aix-Marseille University School of Medicine, revived what he called “zombie” viruses from permafrost in 2014 and 2015, and he and his team reported five new families of ancient viruses capable of infecting amoebas in a February study, as previously reported by CNN. The research led by Claverie proved that ancient microbes could still be infectious despite lying dormant for tens of thousands of years. Using that assumption from Claverie’s work, Bradshaw, director of the Global Ecology Laboratory at Flinders University in Australia, and Strona, a senior researcher at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, designed a simulation to quantify the consequences these pathogens could have. While 1% of pathogens causing major disruption seems low, 4 sextillion cells escape from permafrost every year, Bradshaw said. That’s far more than the number of stars in the galaxy. “One percent of 4 sextillion is a number most people can’t even conceive. There’s so many, many opportunities for this to happen. … The probability is rare for one individual virus, but there are so many potential viruses,” he told CNN in a phone interview. Bradshaw likened the viruses within permafrost to any other invasive species. In the real world, most invasions fail, which the study mirrored. But the reason we still have problems with invasive species, he said, is that there are so many introductions to an ecosystem. READ MORE: Invasive species around the world in pictures During the study’s successful invasion events, the resulting 32% loss of species diversity doesn’t mean that the virus killed one-third of all bacteria in the digital ecosystem, Strona said. Rather, it means that the entire ecosystem saw a loss in bacterial diversity by 32%. When the viruses infected the bacteria and killed their hosts, the effects on the ecosystem were catastrophic. The resources that existed at equilibrium simply weren’t available anymore, so the remaining species were forced into an arms race for survival, Bradshaw said. Predators and prey fought for use of the resources that were left, throwing the system off-balance. If there were less predators to consume prey, prey thrived, overpopulated and then used too many resources. The overproduction then reduced prey populations in a natural culling. If there were more predators, they would consume too much prey for sustainable survival, leading to the same result. The introduction of the virus was the only cause for this major species diversity fluctuation, researchers found. Modern organisms, including humans, have few, if any, natural defense mechanisms for ancient pathogens. But for the research team, the study is more of a call to action than a true warning, Strona and Bradshaw said. “We don’t need to sound the alarm just yet,” said Dr. Kimberley Miner, a climate scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. She said she believes there are more pressing concerns with the climate crisis that are far more controllable, such as slowing the output of carbon into the atmosphere. The study is a great first step in quantifying the risks from these unknown variables, said Miner, who was not involved with this research. But the chance of infection from these emerging pathogens is still “highly improbable.” The areas containing Earth’s permafrost are sparsely populated. If ancient pathogens did somehow manage to escape, they would have trouble finding people to infect. Moreover, permafrost melts gradually throughout the year at a rate of about 1.2 inches (3 centimeters) per season, and most of the 4 sextillion cells are released during this gradual thaw, Miner said. Abrupt thaws in Arctic permafrost, sometimes occurring as quickly as a matter of days, are “what we are most concerned about in terms of releasing organisms that we’re not familiar with,” she explained. With the average global temperature increasing, these abrupt thaws will only become more common. After record high temperatures in July, drone footage captured Siberia’s largest permafrost crater sinking as the ice below ground melted. Strona and Bradshaw cited the need for more research to extend the implications of their findings to human or animal populations. Both researchers said their intention was to give a framework for assessing the risk of biological invaders from a bygone era. The only preventive action in all these cases — be it sea level rise, deadly heat or emerging pathogens — is to slow or stop carbon emissions that lead to global warming and protect Arctic ecosystems, the study authors said. Without doing so, the cascading ecological effects will no longer be science fiction, they said."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","It’s been a sweltering summer for much of the US, with temperatures reaching new highs seemingly every day. And along the Gulf Coast, officials are now grappling with how to handle two potentially deadly disasters set to compound: a hurricane and extreme heat. In New Orleans, this summer was the first time officials were forced to tap into their “rainy day” fund, which is typically meant for hurricane emergency response, to address heat emergencies. “It’s really a new frontier for us,” Anna Nguyen, public information officer for New Orleans Homeland Security Emergency Preparedness, told CNN. Last week, the city issued an emergency declaration for extreme heat, underscoring rising concerns about widespread power outages ahead of peak hurricane season. Without air conditioning and sufficient shelter capacity, the cascading effects of these dual disasters could be deadly for the most vulnerable people. Hazards indirectly related to storms, like exposure to heat, kill nearly as many people as the storm itself, NOAA data shows. Nearly 22% of those so-called indirect deaths were caused by heat and generator misuse from 2013 to 2022. Experts have also said that extreme heat is a silent killer and can be a major contributing factor in the overall hurricane death toll. Emergency response officials in major urban areas like Miami-Dade County, New Orleans and Houston — places that have endured blistering temperatures this summer — told CNN that they’ve had to rethink extreme weather. “Climate change is functioning as a threat multiplier, and we’re seeing more and more often dual threats happening at once,” Christopher Dalbom, assistant director at the Tulane Center for Environmental Law, told CNN. “Anybody who’s been without power during hurricane season in the Gulf knows that even without an official emergency declaration for excessive heat, it gets pretty excessive.” The Gulf Coast is no stranger to hurricanes, but consecutive days with temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit are a new experience for many. An intense hurricane and extreme heat could be a deadly combination because storm destruction and widespread power outages would leave people exposed and vulnerable to heat, said Nikisha Williams, managing director of collective impact at The Miami Foundation. “If Miami experienced extreme heat at the same time, portions of our community would have no relief for what could be days or weeks,” Williams told CNN. “This is extremely dangerous for the most vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly.” When Hurricane Irma pummeled Florida in 2017, for instance, several people were killed at a Hollywood nursing home due to overheating after the storm knocked out the air conditioning. Texas is no different. Over the past few years, Houston has endured devastating hurricanes, a deadly winter freeze, drought, forest fires and now oppressive heat. Officials there are still navigating how to properly prepare for the rapidly changing extreme weather to avoid mass casualties. “Climate change has really been a huge eye-opener for us,” Thomas Muñoz, emergency management coordinator for Houston’s Office of Emergency Management, told CNN. “It’s so unpredictable now, I can say that. We’ve never seen record-breaking days like this.” With dozens of record-high temperatures being set across Florida since the start of June, coupled with brutal humidity that has made the heat even more dangerous, Miami-Dade County officials have been scrambling to prepare for the day that extreme heat might combine with a landfalling hurricane. Pete Gomez, director of emergency management in Miami-Dade County, said the county has been ramping up emergency management and disaster recovery efforts, especially when it comes to addressing both storm threats and extreme heat. In 2021, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava appointed the nation’s first ever chief heat officer with the goal of raising the public’s awareness about the dangers of extreme heat to the same level as hurricanes. Since then, she has expanded initiatives to prepare for a dual-disaster scenario. The county was able to secure funding to install air conditioning units in some affordable housing that did not have any. Gomez said all shelters have backup generator systems to keep residents cool, and they’ve also established relationships with the county’s homeless trust and nonprofit groups, including The Miami Foundation. “That’s the revision we need so we can meet the needs of the community,” Gomez said. “Part of that need is preparedness, getting the message out, and making sure that everything is done to try to minimize the impact of these events as much as possible.” But Williams, who was born and raised in Miami, said the county is still not fully prepared due to rapidly changing demographics and the need for more widespread messaging and education on living in a region prone to climate disasters. “Every storm brings something incredibly different if I’m being honest,” said Williams. “There’s always something new that we didn’t think of. And so, even in the best of situations, we probably will not be 100% prepared.” “But I think we are more prepared today than we were before,” Williams added. Emergency management officials from New Orleans and Houston say they are well-equipped and prepared for both disasters to happen, despite the unprecedented nature of how climate change has recently been taking shape. In Houston, Muñoz said they have expanded their outreach, including revising messaging about resources available in the event of a disaster. They are not only deploying more languages like American sign language to accommodate the city’s diverse population, but they are also fostering partnerships with nonprofit groups and grassroots organizations. “The best thing for us that I’ve learned is just that constant communication with people throughout the year and then when we start the process of seeing something, we do a lot of calling like what do y’all need? What I do we have issues?” Muñoz said. “It’s like we are constantly looking at the what ifs and then we work towards that, and of course, we capture the lessons learned and how we can do better.” For New Orleans, Nguyen said that they’re continuously taking what they have learned from previous storms and are translating it to heat emergencies. Since Hurricane Katrina, she said officials have built robust relationships with the community in order to work toward preparedness and quick recovery. “New Orleans has been battle-tested,” Nguyen said. “There’s always going to be room for improvement, that’s the nature of this work — you can always do things better, but it’s how do we take lessons learned and apply it to what’s in front of us now.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/21/homes/housing-maui-climate-change/index.html,"In Maui and across America, climate change and extreme weather are hurting housing affordability",08-21-2023,"                                                 Three weeks before wildfires ravaged Maui, killing more than 100 people and displacing thousands, Hawaii’s governor, Josh Green, had warned of a different emergency: an acute housing crisis.                                             ","Anna Bahney, CNN","Three weeks before wildfires ravaged Maui, killing more than 100 people and displacing thousands, Hawaii’s governor, Josh Green, had warned of a different emergency: an acute housing crisis. Now Maui starts down the long process of rebuilding the more than 2,000 homes and businesses lost. Much of the devastating damage was to the homes and business where Maui’s working class lived and worked. Many find themselves now caught in both a housing crisis and a climate emergency. Hannah Harris, a physician assistant in the Maui town of Lahaina, and her boyfriend, Tony Ellett, a general manager at a local bar and grill, lost their home to the flames. “The fire came up so fast,” said Harris. “We only had five minutes to get out.” Harris and Ellett just moved into their apartment in May. The couple had jumped at the chance to live in a place with below-market rent that was set aside for local workers. They traded one three-bedroom apartment for another and saw their rent drop from $5,800 a month to $3,800. They are staying with friends now and looking for a new apartment but finding the rents people are asking have gone up since they were looking in the spring. “There was a shortage of housing even before the fire,” said Shantal Catanach, an artist and musician in Lahaina. Catanach and her 3-year-old son Keanu had just moved into a two-bedroom apartment in a newly built 89-unit income-restricted rental building. It too was destroyed. “This is why they have been building these affordable housing buildings. To get people like me and other working families to stay.” Catanach lost several instruments and DJ equipment as well as more than 30 of her paintings in the fire. Now she’s staying in another part of the island with friends, where she said there were already seven roommates before she arrived. She is grateful that she and her son were able to escape the fire and happy to have a place to stay, for now. “You don’t want to overstay your welcome,” she said. “But you’re in a tough spot financially. You feel insecure. It is a safe place, but it doesn’t feel like home.” For people on Maui and across the US, climate change is making the affordable housing crunch even worse. In many cases, Americans have sought affordable homes in areas that are in greater risk of hurricanes, floods, extreme heat and wildfires, according to a report from the Urban Institute. A human-caused climate crisis has exacerbated the hot and dry conditions that allow wildfires to ignite and grow in many parts of the planet, according to a UN Environment Programme report. This has primed vulnerable areas for devastating results. While it is difficult to link the Maui fires to the climate crisis without a thorough analysis, scientists say conditions there are consistent with trends that are known as climate changes. Specifically, parts of Maui were in a severe drought that left vegetation dried out, potentially providing fuel for wildfires. “What has happened to Maui is that because of climate change we have become a drier climate,” said Stan Franco, a board member of Stand Up Maui, a housing advocacy group. “We have had fires before. Grass fires. But not fires damaging buildings and taking lives.” “The affordable housing picture was pretty grim on Maui even before the fire,” he said. The disaster “adds more pain for our people as far as housing is concerned.” In Maui County, more than half of renters are considered rent burdened and pay over 30% of their income toward rent, a standard affordability threshold, according to a housing report released last month from University of Hawaii’s Economic Research Organization. The report found Maui County had the highest share in the state of those who are severely cost burdened, or pay over half their income toward rent. The median price of a home on Maui is over $1 million. The typical household needs to earn $252,000 a year to afford to buy a house in Hawaii, according to the governor’s office. Many of the Maui residents impacted by the fire work in tourism and service jobs, which do not approach those salaries. A typical nurse earns $113,000 a year in Hawaii, while a hotel desk worker earns $52,430 and a food preparation worker earns $37,580, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. “The people who live here work in the hotel industry,” said Franco. “They are taking two or three jobs. They are living with relatives. They were making do. The fire has created much more of a problem.” Even before the fire, fewer than 1 in 3 Maui households could afford a single family home, according to the governor’s office. The housing emergency declaration by the governor before the fire had introduced a new process to help build quality homes faster. But now it’s much more complicated on Maui. And in the meantime, displaced residents need somewhere to live. Over 14.5 million homes in the US were affected by natural disasters in 2021, according to a report from Corelogic, a real estate data company, amounting to an estimated $57 billion in damage. That included about 4,000 homes impacted by wildfire, 560,000 homes impacted by severe weather like tornadoes and hail, more than a million homes impacted by hurricanes and over 12 million homes that were impacted by winter storms causing water damage and burst pipes. These extreme weather events are increasing. By the beginning of August – before the fire in Maui – there had already been 15 confirmed weather or climate disaster that had losses over $1 billion each in the US this year, according to the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. Between 1980 and 2022 the average number of events of that magnitude each year was eight. The annual average over the past five years has risen to 18. This is putting more people at greater risk, including 60 million homes in areas that could expect at least moderate losses, according to a report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. “When disasters strike, the lowest-income and most marginalized survivors are often hardest hit,” said Diane Yentel, the president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a membership organization focused on affordable housing. “They have the fewest resources and face the longest, steepest path to recovery.” That can lead people to live in uninhabitable homes, sleep in cars, double- or triple-up with other low-income families or pay more than half of their incomes on rent, which puts them at increased risk of displacement, eviction, and homelessness, she said. The current federal disaster recovery system was designed for the middle class. “It is a system that never contemplated, and so it does not address, the unique needs of the lowest-income and most marginalized people,” Yentel said. Some survivors may have language barriers or lack the ability to produce necessary documents quickly. Some are among the 5.9 million households that don’t have a bank or credit union account, according to an estimate from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At times, she said, the aid can exacerbate many of the challenges people struggling for housing faced prior to the storm. During recovery, she said, resources devoted to homelessness can be stretched to account for many more people who are temporarily homeless. In such cases, it makes it harder for communities to provide for the pre-disaster population experiencing housing instability. Natural disasters also exacerbate the existing rental housing crisis for households with the lowest incomes, Yentel said. “After Hurricane Sandy [in 2012], for example, households already dealing with housing instability were further destabilized through displacement and increased rents,” she said. “Two years after Sandy, few new affordable homes had been completed, yet survivors were no longer eligible for federal rental assistance.” Maui can expect to face a long timeline for rebuilding, and at much greater costs. Hawaii’s high land and construction costs and lengthy approval process make it hard to build affordable housing there, said Peter Niess, owner of Maui Architectural Group. Many homes destroyed in the Lahaina fire were older homes that had been remodeled and expanded over many years to accommodate multi-family living due to high housing costs, according to Niess. “Even if they build back the allowable portion of their property, it will displace people in the long term,” he said. “There was more than one kitchen, more than one family living there.” These types of cobbled-together solutions to affordable housing are now gone, as are other recent hard-won affordable housing projects. “We were a part of a workforce housing project that burned down,” said Niess. “It is such a long process to get through the entitlement procedures with the county and the state.” And while rebuilding is an opportunity to keep climate concerns in mind, that usually increases costs. “You can’t have a more solid bulletproof, code-compliant home and a more affordable home at the same time,” said Niess. “Not unless someone subsidizes that substantially.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/americas/canada-wildfires-climate-change-quebec/index.html,Weather that drove eastern Canada’s devastating wildfires made twice as likely by climate change,08-22-2023,"The weather conditions that fueled record-shattering wildfires in eastern Canada earlier this summer – and sent plumes of hazardous air into the US – were made more likely and more intense by the climate crisis, according to a new report published ...","Laura Paddison, CNN","The weather conditions that fueled record-shattering wildfires in eastern Canada earlier this summer – and sent plumes of hazardous air into the US – were made more likely and more intense by the climate crisis, according to a new report published Tuesday. Scientists from the World Weather Attribution initiative – which calculates the role of climate change in extreme weather events –  found human-caused climate change more than doubled the likelihood of hot, dry and windy conditions that drove the Quebec fires between May and July, and made this fire-prone weather at least 20% more intense. The severity of Quebec’s fire season up to the end of July was also made 50% more intense by climate change, according to the report. Climate change’s impact may be much greater than the study’s figures show, said Friederike Otto, co-founder of WWA and senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute in the UK, who added that the report had used the most conservative estimates. Wildfires are complex to study because of the tangle of factors that influence them, but scientists say climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, is loading the dice in favor of more devastating fires. “It’s becoming evident that the dry and warm conditions conducive to wildfires are becoming more common and more intense around the world as a result of climate change,” said Clair Barnes, a research associate at the Grantham Institute and a report author. Canada has experienced an unprecedented fire season this year, amid hot and dry conditions. May to June was the warmest such two-month period in Canada since records began in 1940, breaking the previous record by a substantial margin – 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit). More than 15 million hectares (over 37 million acres) across the country have been scorched – an area about the size of Illinois. The fires have killed at least 17 people and forced the evacuations of more than 150,000. Quebec has been particularly affected, with the most area burned of any Canadian province. Wildfires have devastated 5.2 million hectares (12.8 million acres) there so far, about 26 times the average amount burned by late August. The fires have also caused dangerous levels of air pollution in Canada and across swaths of the US, leading to school closures in both countries and a spike in asthma-related hospital visits. Smoke from the fires even made it to Western Europe. It is by far the worst wildfire season Canada has ever experienced, and there are still more than two months left to go. To understand the role of climate change in the fires, the WWA scientists looked at “fire weather” – including high temperatures, strong winds and dry conditions, all of which help fires ignite, spread and intensify. The scientists used data from the Fire Weather Index – a measure of fire danger – to gauge the persistence of extreme fire conditions as well as the severity of the fire season overall. They then used climate models to understand the role climate change played. They concluded that a wildfire season as severe as the one Quebec experienced up to the end of July was at least seven times more likely to occur because of climate change, and that human-induced warming made Quebec’s total fire weather season at least 50% more intense. Climate change also made the peak fire weather in Quebec during the same period at least twice as likely and 20% more intense, according to the report. While Quebec’s fires were unprecedented, the report authors wrote, “they are no longer extremely unusual.” In today’s climate, which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than preindustrial times, similar weather conditions can be expected once every 25 years, the report found. Around 1,000 fires continue to rage across Canada, with 200 of them burning in the Northwest Territories, where thousands of people were evacuated Friday from the capital Yellowknife. About 35,000 people are under evacuation orders in British Columbia. Kira Hoffman, a fire ecologist at the University of British Columbia and the Bulkley Valley Research Centre, who was not involved in the report, said there are many factors that contribute to extreme wildfire seasons, including logging, large-scale clearouts and abandoning Indigenous fire stewardship techniques. But all these factors interact with the climate crisis, she told CNN. “A rapidly changing climate is creating longer, drier and hotter wildfire seasons across Canada,” Hoffman said. One of the major concerns with increasingly intense fire behavior is the impact on wildfire management, said Michael Flannigan, BC research chair for Predictive Services, Emergency Management and Fire Science at Thompson Rivers University. “If we see more days above fire intensity thresholds, we will see more escape fires, more area burned and more impacts to society,” he told CNN. “Until we stop burning fossil fuels,” said Otto in a statement, “the number of wildfires will continue to increase, burning larger areas for longer periods of time.” CNN’s Brandon Miller contributed to reporting"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Some leaves in tropical forests from South America to South East Asia are getting so hot they may no longer be able to photosynthesize, with big potential consequences for the world’s forests, according to a new study. Leaves’ ability to photosynthesize – the process by which they make energy from carbon dioxide, sunlight and water – begins to fail when their temperature reaches around 46.7 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit). While this may seem high, leaves can get much hotter than the air temperature, according to the report published Wednesday in Nature by a group of scientists from countries including the US, Australia and Brazil. The scientists used temperature data beamed down from thermal satellite sensors on the International Space Station, 400 kilometers (nearly 250 miles) above the Earth. They combined this with on-the-ground observations from leaf-warming experiments, in which scientists climbed into the canopy to painstakingly add sensors to leaves. Rather than looking at average temperatures, the scientists were looking at extremes, said Christopher Doughty, associate professor in ecoinformatics at Northern Arizona University and a report author. They found that average forest canopy temperatures peaked at 34 degrees Celsius (93 Fahrenheit) but some exceeded 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). Currently, 0.01% of leaves are passing the critical temperature threshold beyond which their ability to photosynthesize breaks down, the report found, potentially killing the leaf and the tree. This percentage, while small, is poised to increase as the world warms, the report said, posing a threat to the world’s tropical forests – which cover roughly 12% of the planet and hold more than half of the world’s species. They also provide a vital role in sucking up and storing carbon and helping to regulate the global climate. “There are all sorts of potential feedbacks once you start losing bits of forests, even leaves on individual trees,” Doughty said on a call with reporters. Tropical forests can withstand around 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 Fahrenheit) of additional global warming before they reach a tipping point in terms of their ability to photosynthesize, according to the report. If warming exceeds this level, the amount of leaves surpassing critical temperature thresholds could rise to 1.4%, potentially causing large-scale leaf loss and the death of the whole tree, the report found. This level of warming is not expected under current climate policies, which are estimated to bring 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels. But it is within the range of the most pessimistic climate scenarios if the world continues to burn fossil fuels. While these figures may seem small, the risk is significant given how critical tropical trees are for life, the climate system and the planet. “Almost all life – including humans – is dependent on photosynthesis for food either directly or indirectly,” said Kevin Collins, senior lecturer in environment and systems at the Open University, who was not involved in the research. The findings indicate that global warming is putting this vital process at risk, he told the Science Media Centre. But, he added, there are more immediate concerns for tropical forests, including deforestation, wildfires and droughts. Christopher Still, a forest ecosystem professor at Oregon State University, also not involved in the report, said that the research provided some novel insights. While there’s been a big focus on the impact of drought on tree loss, he told CNN, “this paper says it’s not just drought – we need to really also worry about the temperatures that leaves are reaching.” While he acknowledged the numbers in the report are small, he added, “I would focus a little bit less on the percentages, and more on the concepts of leaves pushing up against these really high temperature conditions and how often that happens, how long it lasts and what it really means.” Others were more cautious. Chloe Brimicombe, a climate scientist at the University of Graz in Austria, said that given how few leaves are reaching the critical temperature threshold, and how high warming would need to get before a tipping point, “this suggests in theory tropical forests are quite resilient to climate change.” She told the Science Media Centre, “this is a simple model and trees and forest dynamics are much more complex than this.” The report authors said despite uncertainties, the research gives important insights around how tropical forests will respond to climate change. “It’s a little bit of a canary in the coal mine that we’re starting to see,” Joshua Fisher, a climate scientist at Chapman University and a report author, said on a call with reporters. “And you want to be able to detect something happening before it’s widespread.”"

","Mary Gilbert, Caitlin Kaiser and Brandon Miller, CNN","Tropical Depression Ten has formed near the Yucatan Peninsula in the western Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center, and it could become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon that would make landfall in Florida as early as Wednesday. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Yucatan in Mexico from Tulum to Rio Lagartos, including Cozumel. A tropical storm watch has also been issued for the western tip of Cuba in the provinces of Pinar Del Rio and the Isle of Youth. The system is developing as what was Tropical Storm Franklin has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane in the Atlantic. The depression is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm on Sunday as it meanders in the Yucatan Channel. By Monday, the system will begin moving north, entering the Gulf of Mexico. The storm is expected to further strengthen on Monday and Tuesday as the system crosses the Gulf, moving towards Florida. The official track calls for the storm to become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and make landfall along the western coast of the Florida Peninsula by Wednesday. The forecast cone stretches from Tampa Bay to Panama City, and the NHC notes that “that there is significant uncertainty in 3-4 day intensity predictions and [the public] are urged to monitor changes to future forecasts.” The next storm name on the Atlantic’s list is Idalia (pronounced ee-DAL-ya). Who should pay attention? Anyone living in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba and the northern Gulf and Florida coast should monitor the forecast in the coming days. The direction and strength of the upper-level steering winds around this system will dictate where it will move and how quickly. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued an executive order Saturday declaring a state of emergency for 33 counties ahead of the potential inclement weather. “The Governor and the Florida Division of Emergency Management are taking timely precautions to ensure Florida’s communities, infrastructure and resources are prepared, including those communities that are still recovering following Hurricane Ian,” reads a news release announcing the executive order. When could it affect the US? The depression is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm on Sunday as it moves through the Yucatan Channel. By Monday, the system will likely enter the Gulf of Mexico, and move towards Florida. It could become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon and hit the western coast of the Florida Peninsula by Wednesday. How strong could it get? It’s still too soon to tell how strong this system could get – or how fast it could strengthen. But it will be tracking through the warmest waters in the entire Atlantic basin – a vast source of energy for a developing storm. Exceptionally warm water can provide storms the fuel needed to strengthen and sometimes undergo rapid intensification. Sea surface temperatures are record warm in the Gulf of Mexico and extremely high across the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Water temperatures need to be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit to sustain tropical development, and portions of the Caribbean and Gulf are well above that threshold. A hurdle to development: Warm water isn’t the only factor at play. This tropical system would also need upper-level winds to cooperate. High wind shear – the wind’s change in direction or speed with altitude – can tear a developing storm apart. How much wind shear this potential system faces is a critical factor in its formation and final strength. One forecast model shows more wind shear, limiting its development. Another shows less wind shear, allowing the system to develop. Either way, wind shear may decrease for a time early next week across the far northern Caribbean and eastern Gulf of Mexico, allowing any system that forms to hold together. Meanwhile, out in the central Atlantic, what was Tropical Storm Franklin strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour, according to a Saturday morning update from the National Hurricane Center. This was confirmed via aircraft reconnaissance by the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters. Hurricane Franklin is currently located 620 miles south of Bermuda and is moving relatively slowly at 7 miles per hour towards the north-northwest. “Steady strengthening is forecast, and Franklin could become a major hurricane early next week,” said the center in its update. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher with winds above 111 mph. “Swells generated by Franklin are expected to begin affecting Bermuda by Sunday night,” the hurricane center said, noting that, “these swells are also likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions late this weekend into early next week along portions of the East Coast of the United States.” Small variations in Franklin’s track through the weekend will determine exactly how close it gets to Bermuda when it make its closest pass Monday and Monday night. Franklin’s winds and rainfall will extend beyond its center. Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are possible across Bermuda early next week as Franklin makes its closest approach. A few showers and thunderstorms are also possible across Bermuda as Franklin passes. CNN’s Zoe Sottile contributed to this report."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","During this week’s Republican primary debate on Fox News, a young voter notably asked about the climate crisis: How would these presidential candidates assuage concerns that the Republican Party “doesn’t care” about the issue? The question was all but unavoidable after weeks of extreme, deadly weather. Global temperature records have been shattered, extreme heat has soared off-the-charts in the US and the Maui wildfire death toll continues to climb. What followed the question was one of the night’s most chaotic exchanges, demonstrating the challenge some conservatives face in getting climate policy on the 2024 GOP agenda, even as extreme weather takes its toll on millions of people across the country. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the leader of a state that has been thrashed by deadly extreme weather in recent years, refused the moderators’ show-of-hands question on whether climate change is caused by humans. He used the moment to deride the media and President Joe Biden’s response in Maui. Then 38-year-old Vivek Ramaswamy – notably the youngest candidate on stage – called the “climate change agenda” a “hoax,” an answer that elicited intense boos from the audience. A majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents – 55% – say human activity is causing changes to the world’s climate, according to a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland poll. It also found a majority of Americans and Republicans say their area has been impacted by extreme heat in the past five years. But connecting the dots between climate and extreme weather is proving a more partisan issue. The poll found there are deep divides between Republicans and Democrats on the question of whether human-caused climate change is contributing to extreme weather: just 35% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they think climate change is a major factor in extremely hot days, compared with 85% of those who lean Democrat. After the debate, a prominent conservative climate group said Ramaswamy tried to clarify his position. “He came to our after-party and he blatantly told us that he believes climate change is real,” Benji Backer, founder of the American Conservation Coalition, told CNN. “So, he changed his position again.” Asked by CNN on Friday whether he believes climate change is real, Ramaswamy responded, “Climate change has existed as long as the Earth has existed. Manmade climate change has existed as long as man has existed on the earth.” In an email, Ramaswamy’s campaign spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN the candidate does believe climate change is real, but policies to address it “have little to do with climate change and more to do with penalizing the West as a way to achieve global ‘equity.’” Yet for Republicans working to make climate policy more mainstream in the GOP, Ramaswamy’s language at the debate echoed a climate crisis-denying candidate who wasn’t onstage, former President Donald Trump. Trump has called climate change itself a “hoax” and falsely claimed wind turbines cause cancer. “The fact that he chose the word hoax, to me, he’s emulating what President Trump had said before,” Heather Reams, president of conservative nonprofit Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, told CNN. Reams, who was sitting in the audience in Milwaukee, noted that Ramaswamy calling the “climate change agenda” a hoax didn’t go over well in a room full of Republicans. “The whole place booed him, so it wasn’t well received,” Reams said. “Hearing booing was actually heartening to hear that the party is really moving on, they’re seeing the economic opportunities that can be had for the United States being a leader in lowering emissions.” Ramaswamy’s response was an attempt to go after the older GOP voting base in the primary, Backer said. It’s the kind of audience that Fox News has historically played to when it hosts climate deniers on some of its shows or casts doubt on the connection between extreme weather and the climate crisis – but Backer said the fact the network even asked this question “just shows that the pendulum is shifting.” Backer warned Ramasway’s response to the question risks alienating younger conservative voters who are increasingly concerned about climate impacts. “I’ve in two presidential elections and I’ve never voted for a Republican president in my life, because I don’t vote for climate deniers,” Backer said, adding that climate denial “is the way of the past.” Several Republican presidential candidates have said they believe climate change is real and caused by human activity – a shift from previous elections. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley acknowledged its reality but said foreign nations, including India and China, bear larger responsibility for addressing it. Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have all engaged frequently with conservative groups, Reams and Backer said. “I think that Nikki Haley provided a very clear, very positive response,” Danielle Butcher Franz, CEO of the American Conservation Coalition, told CNN. “We need to see more responses like that in the Republican Party. I think it’s important that we show the conservative environmental movement is here to stay.” Backer warned that Ramaswamy and other candidates risk losing young voters if they continue to engage in climate denial – or anything that sounds remotely like it. “There’s a lot of Republicans leading on this, but the narrative is that we don’t care,” Backer said. “And if we nominate another person who doesn’t care, young people are not going to forget that. There’s not going to be a lot of baby boomers in 20 years, so you better start thinking about the next generation.” CNN’s Aaron Pellish contributed to this report."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","In a record-breaking year of disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is announcing nearly $3 billion Monday for communities to build resiliency against climate change-fueled extreme weather. The new money, which will come from Congress’s bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year, is being announced just as the agency is running out of disaster-relief funds and a dangerous hurricane is bearing down on Florida. FEMA needs Congress to approve additional spending when it’s back in session to prevent the agency from falling into the red. The infrastructure law contained billions of dollars to help make communities more resilient to the impacts of a warming planet, like rising sea levels and stronger storms. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told CNN studies have shown resilience is an investment that pays off. “Every dollar that we spend in resilience – like this money right here – saves us $6 in response and recovery costs,” Criswell told CNN. “We want to reduce that complexity of the recoveries, which saves money on the disaster relief fund, because then we don’t have to spend as much to help communities recover from these types of disasters.” The resiliency funding, the details of which were shared first with CNN, is coming from a different source than what props up FEMA’s disaster relief fund – the money the agency uses to respond to storms. That fund is dangerously close to empty in a year that has had a record number of billion-dollar disasters to-date and a hurricane taking aim at Florida this week. Criswell told CNN that the agency’s disaster relief fund is projected to run out of money “toward the middle of September” unless Congress passes additional funding to replenish it. Congress is expected to return after Labor Day. Despite bipartisan support in the Senate, House conservatives have warned they are unhappy with disaster funding being tied to additional funding for Ukraine – which could set up a protracted spending battle. If funding isn’t passed soon after Congress returns in early September, it could hamper the agency’s response to future Atlantic hurricanes and delay long-term recovery efforts in Maui. FEMA has already factored into its spending the immediate response to the Maui wildfires, Hurricane Hilary in California and the initial response to Idalia, Criswell said. The agency is monitoring the disaster relief fund “daily,” she said, to see if they need to adjust “to make sure that we always have enough to support lifesaving efforts.” “We are putting plans in place for how we would use our tools to help make sure that we always have funding to support the immediate lifesaving needs,” Criswell said. Administration officials hope the infusion of new funds for climate resiliency will help make communities stronger and safer. In a first, FEMA is awarding resilience funding for extreme heat, agreeing to fund a project proposed by Portland, Oregon, to plant 10,500 trees over the next three years to provide more shade, improve air quality, and help with flooding during major rainstorms. “That project is going to be a really great example for other communities to see what’s in the realm of possibility to help combat the extreme heat that we have been experiencing over the last several years and is continuing to increase,” Criswell said. “This is the first one that really allows us to use trees to help reduce the urban heat islands that communities have.” Other projects that will be funded include strengthening the grid in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, to withstand 150-mph winds and keep power on during hurricanes; installing new sewer mains in Detroit’s flood-prone Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood; and upgrading Nevada’s Hobart Creek Reservoir Dam, both to protect water levels and keep the dam safe. In addition, FEMA is dispensing millions of dollars to help make communities more resilient to flooding, funding 149 projects in 28 states and the District of Columbia under its flood mitigation assistance program. The funding will be used to elevate some homes and acquire and demolish others that have flooded repeatedly. Some of the projects include elevating 84 structures and opening new green space in east Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, and elevating 19 homes in the Florida Keys using piers and concrete footings. In addition, the funding will be used to buy and demolish repeatedly flooded buildings in Machesney Park, Illinois, turning the area into green space. “Our local and community partners are the first responders when extreme weather events unfold, and they are on the front lines of building our nation’s resilience to the impacts of climate change,” Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. Beyond FEMA, climate resilience has become a large focus for President Joe Biden, whose White House is working with agencies to deploy $50 billion in total resilience and adaptation money passed in the infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act. Amid an unprecedented year of disasters, Criswell added it’s critical for communities across the nation to make themselves stronger and more prepared as climate change-fueled weather pummels the US year-round. “We have typically postured ourselves for the peak of hurricane season as our busiest time of the year,” Criswell said. “What we are seeing is it’s a year-round operational tempo like we have never seen before. We have to make sure that we are working with our teams every day to be able to address the severe weather events happening year-round.”"

","Jessie Yeung, CNN","Ten years ago, China’s capital was often covered in dense yellow and gray smog, so thick it shrouded nearly everything from view. People locked their windows, donned face masks and cranked air purifiers on high to escape what became known as Beijing’s “air-pocalypse.” The air quality was so bad, and became so globally infamous, that Chinese leaders launched a multibillion-dollar “war against pollution.” A decade on, those efforts are paying dividends. China’s pollution levels in 2021 had fallen 42% from 2013, according to a new report released Tuesday, making it a rare success story in the region, where pollution is getting worse in some parts, including South Asia. The annual Air Quality Life Index report, produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, praised China’s “staggering success in combating pollution.” Pollution levels globally have fallen slightly from 2013 to 2021 – which the report said was “entirely due to China’s progress.” Without China’s improvements, the world’s average pollution would have risen instead. The improvement means the average Chinese citizen’s lifespan is now 2.2 years longer, the report said. Chinese cities used to dominate global rankings of the world’s worst air quality; while some are still on those lists, in many cases they have been overtaken by cities in South Asia and the Middle East. In 2021, Beijing recorded its best monthly air quality since records began in 2013. “The ‘Beijing blue’ has gradually become our new normal,” said the country’s environment minister at the time, according to state media. But, the report warned, there is still work to do as China remains the world’s 13th most polluted country. And Beijing’s particulate pollution – the tiny but highly dangerous pollutants that can evade the human body’s usual defenses – is still 40% higher than in the most polluted county in the United States. While China’s particulate pollution levels are within its national standards, they “significantly exceed” the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines, the report said. However, the progress made in China shows that change is possible, if the government and its people are willing and able to put in the work. For instance, the report said, since 2014 the Chinese government has limited the number of cars on roads in major cities; banned new coal plants from the most-polluted areas; cut emissions or closed existing plants; and reduced high-polluting industrial activity such as the manufacturing of iron and steel. “At the foundation of those actions were common elements: political will and resources, both human and financial, that reinforced each other,” the report said. “When the public and policymakers have these tools, action becomes much more likely.” In some other places, the situation has become worse. South Asia is now the “global pollution epicenter,” home to the four most polluted countries – Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan – which collectively make up nearly a quarter of the world’s population, the report said. In each of these countries, the average resident is losing five years of their lifespan to pollution, it added. That toll is even higher in the most polluted regions. Whereas air pollution has steadily decreased in China over the years, it has increased in South Asia to the point where it has a greater effect on life expectancy than tobacco use or unsafe water. In India the risk is especially high, in part due to its population density and the sheer amount of people living in highly polluted urban areas. In 2021, India’s particulate pollution was more than 10 times  WHO guidelines, the report said. There are various factors at play, it said; these countries have seen explosive population growth, economic development and industrialization over the past 20 years. Energy demand and fossil fuel use have skyrocketed accordingly; in Bangladesh, the number of cars on the road tripled from 2010 to 2020. Other practices like crop burning, which many farmers use to clear their fields for harvest, and the use of brick kilns have also contributed to rising pollution. The governments in these regions have begun forming initiatives and policies to cut back on pollution, but may face a tougher task due to the difference in economic strength and infrastructure, the report said. “The countries experiencing some of the worst pollution today don’t have the tools they need to fill these basic air quality management holes,” such as establishing reliable and publicly accessible air quality data, the report said. Africa, another hotspot for pollution, faces similar difficulties. While there are large global funds to help African countries fight health risks like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, there is nothing similar dedicated to fighting pollution. Aid from international organizations and private donors could go a long way in building the infrastructure needed, the report added, but “right now, that’s not happening,” it said."

She is the author of “Aging in America.” Ian Sue Wing is a professor of earth and environment at Boston University specializing in climate change economics and integrated assessment modeling. Giacomo Falchetta is a research scholar with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Italy. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion at CNN. Retiree Jeanne Langan Burris, 61, a resident of Naples, Florida, often starts her daily tennis match at 7 a.m. Even at that early hour, however, she says she sometimes finds herself baking on the court in oppressively hot temperatures. The torrid heat is a far cry from Westport, Connecticut, where Burris and her husband raised their three children. It’s even further removed from Buffalo, New York — a city renowned for blizzards and brutally cold temperatures — where she grew up. Burris still loves life in southwest Florida, where she moved a half-dozen years ago to be nearer her aging parents, but climate change has brought challenges. Naples is said to be one of the US cities most likely to suffer the loss of home and property because of rising sea levels. And because of the intense heat, Burris said, “I change two or three times a day,” she said. The summer of 2023 continues to punish Naples – and huge swaths of the United States – with furnace-like weather. Triple-digit heat afflicted tens of millions of people across the center of the country this summer and may prove to be a permanent feature of life in the Sunbelt. July and August, which saw the hottest summer on record in the US, were particularly brutal in the southern and southwestern states. And week upon week of blisteringly hot weather is especially worrisome for older adults, many of whom chose to relocate to Sunbelt regions in search of balmy winter weather – never counting on the dangerously elevated summer heat that has come with climate change. Visions of ditching the wearying (and potentially dangerous) task of shoveling snow from their driveways have long attracted retirees to places like Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Texas and South Carolina, which are the most popular retirement magnets. But older adults in the Sunbelt got warmer weather than they bargained for. The record-breaking heat waves of summer 2023 (not to mention the already established pattern of temperature records tumbling summer after summer in recent years) has made these localities seem like “hell on earth,” in the words of one unhoused resident of Phoenix who found himself at the mercy of the unrelenting heat. In Phoenix, 110-degree-plus temperatures continued for an astonishing 31 consecutive days. Arizona is not alone: El Paso, Texas, saw 44 consecutive days of triple-digit temperatures, and the heat index in Miami topped 100 degrees for 46 straight days. Many people find respite indoors in air conditioning of course, but part of the appeal of retirement is being able to stroll and do sports out-of-doors – something that this summer’s stifling heat has made all but impossible. Organizations and professionals who help retirees plan their golden years have begun counseling that they toss out the old retirement playbook and consider retiring in places where the effects of global warming have so far been less pronounced. We’re not just talking about personal comfort. Extreme heat is miserable for everyone, but can be particularly lethal for older adults. More than half of the two dozen people who died of heat-related causes in Maricopa County, Arizona, this summer were 65 or older. Heat stress is especially harmful to older people, worsening common health conditions like heart, lung and kidney disease, and even triggering delirium. Poor air quality makes it hard to breathe, especially for those who already struggle with shortness of breath. Even temperatures as low as 80 degrees can be dangerous for older people with underlying health problems. Prescription medications make older people even more sensitive to heat: Anticholinergics — a class of drugs prescribed for gastrointestinal conditions, COPD and other ailments — reduce their capacity to sweat and cool down, while beta-blockers and diuretics can cause dehydration. Meanwhile, being confined to an air-conditioned apartment for days on end can leave older adults depressed and isolated. High energy bills that go along with the air conditioning that makes life bearable in warmer climates can also be a significant burden for those living on a fixed income. And seniors with limited physical mobility may find it difficult to travel to a public cooling center — if they are lucky enough to have one nearby. Will heat waves like the summer of 2023 scare away older adults from southern retirement destinations over the long haul? Or will retirees continue to flock to places like Florida and Arizona in the hope that the summer 2023 swelter is a fluke — and prioritize other enticements like recreational amenities and a low cost of living? The jury is still out, but we urge older adults to seriously factor climate issues into their relocation plans. Our research shows that Sunbelt heat extremes — a direct consequence of human-induced climate change — are here to stay. If older adults continue to migrate to Arizona, Florida and desert regions of California, the dual forces of rising temperatures and aging populations will place unprecedented demands on cities, counties and states to meet older adults’ pressing health needs. That includes investing in conveniently located cooling centers and training first responders to work with adults who may be reluctant to leave their homes during a heat wave or other weather emergency. One the other heand, should older adults living in cooler locales like New England, the Pacific Northwest and the upper Midwest stay put to avoid the heat extremes of the Sunbelt? Not necessarily. Northern climates may be cooler, but they are actually heating up faster. Chronic exposure of populations to heat, measured by an indicator called person-degree days, will triple nationwide by 2050 — but will increase by five times in the Mid-Atlantic and upper midwestern states like Michigan and Wisconsin, and a factor of six in New England. Our research focused on heat exposure only, but climate change drives other extreme weather events, such as droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, flooding and intense blizzards.  Resources like Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation provides helpful weather-related information on potential retirement destinations. Retirees also should research whether a potential future home state has a well-developed climate plan that considers older adults’ distinctive needs. Does your ideal destination have heat and/or weather advisory warning systems? Does your dream neighborhood have cooling (or warming) centers close by? Are there urban green spaces like parks that can protect against the urban “heat island” effect? Could you access supports like Low Income Home Energy Assistance Programs for hardening your home against weather extremes? In the future, city planners and policymakers must prepare to face the twin challenges of climate change impacts and population aging by investing in knowledge, capacity and infrastructure for adaptation. The climate system’s inertia means that warming is inevitable, with potential effects nationwide. Careful research and planning can help retirees find a home where they can live out their golden years in relative safety and comfort. This version updates the description of the extreme heat in the first paragraph."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/01/world/polar-bear-greenhouse-gas-emissions-intl-scli-climate-scn/index.html,Scientists say they’ve found a direct link between planet-warming pollution and polar bear survival,09/01/2023,"                                                 Scientists say they have found a link between human-related greenhouse gas emissions and polar bear reproduction and survival rates for the first time in a new study, potentially overcoming a barrier to protecting the species.                                             ","Amarachi Orie, CNN","Scientists say they have found a link between human-related greenhouse gas emissions and polar bear reproduction and survival rates for the first time in a new study, potentially overcoming a barrier to protecting the species. Polar bears live in 19 populations across the Arctic and are found in Canada, the United States, Russia, Greenland and Norway, according to conservation organization Polar Bears International. The populations live under distinct and varying circumstances, but all depend upon ice sheets to access their main prey, two species of seal, said study coauthor Steven Amstrup, chief scientist emeritus at Polar Bears International. When sea ice melts, polar bears are forced onto land where they are deprived of food and must survive on fat reserves that they have accumulated beforehand. Climate change caused by human activity is accelerating sea ice loss, giving polar bears less time to feed and build up their fat reserves, and more days where they are forced to go without food. This leads ultimately to a decline in their population. Researchers from Polar Bears International, the University of Washington and the University of Wyoming have quantified the connection between the number of ice-free days a population of polar bears has to endure and the amount of planet-warming pollution released into the atmosphere, as well as corresponding polar bear survival rates in some populations, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Science. Polar bears were listed as “threatened” due to human-caused climate warming under the US Endangered Species Act, or ESA, in 2008. But the US Department of Interior said at the time that, because threat to a particular species couldn’t be directly linked to a specific source of greenhouse gases, federal agencies don’t have to consider emissions when approving projects. The researchers said the new study provides evidence of that direct link. Researchers looked at polar bear subpopulations that had experienced at least 10 years with ice-free seasons from 1979 — when satellite imagery of sea ice first became available — to 2020. They found that the number of days polar bears were forced to go without food increased as greenhouse gas emissions accumulated. For example, polar bears in the Chukchi Sea in the Arctic Ocean were forced to go without food for about 12 days in 1979. It increased to about 137 days in 2020, with another day of fasting being added for every 14 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere. Subpopulations in areas where ice sheets would typically melt entirely during the summer — such as in Hudson Bay — saw slower increases in the days they were forced to go without food over time, compared with subpopulations in areas where ice sheets would usually remain during the summer, such as in the South Beaufort Sea. Bears in areas where ice sheets used to persist for longer in the summer are now experiencing “a sudden shift” in their environment, requiring a significant adjustment where they are having forced fast days that they did not have before, Amstrup told CNN. A 2020 study that Amstrup was involved in found that the number of days a bear can survive without food varies by region and the condition of the animal, but the more ice-free days experienced, the steeper the decline in reproduction and survival. The researchers behind the new study combined the relationship they found between the number of forced fast days polar bears had to endure and cumulative greenhouse gas emissions with the connection found in 2020 between the number of forced fast days and declining survival rates. That allowed them to calculate the impact of cumulative emissions on the rate of polar bear survival. “When the (Department of the Interior) memo was written in 2008, we could not say how greenhouse gas emissions equated to a decline in polar bear populations. But within a few years we could directly relate the quantity of emissions to climate warming and later to Arctic sea ice loss as well,” said study coauthor Cecilia Bitz, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, in the news release. “Our study shows that not only sea ice, but polar bear survival, can be directly related to greenhouse gas emissions.” For example, the study noted that each of the hundreds of power plants in the US might make a relatively small contribution to emissions, but collectively the power plants emit nearly 2 gigatons of greenhouse gases each year. This would be about 60-plus gigatons over the 30-plus year life span of a polar bear in the southern Beaufort Sea. In this subpopulation, bears endure an extra forced fasting day for every 23 gigatons of emissions added to the atmosphere, so their survival rate would be reduced by about 4% by the power plant emissions over that period, according to the study. The US Department of the Interior declined to comment on the findings. Kirsten Zickfeld, distinguished professor of climate science at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said the new research shows a shift in what’s possible when it comes to demonstrating the effects of climate change. “Previous research showed that the more carbon dioxide we produce from human activities, the more our climate changes. The new study by Amstrup and Bitz takes this idea further by showing that this direct link also applies to ecosystem impacts,” said Zickfeld, who was not involved in the study. “They found that when we emit more carbon dioxide, it directly affects how many polar bear cubs can survive. This finding allows us to connect the decline in polar bear populations to individual sources of carbon emissions.” Amstrup said he hopes the study can be used as a template by other researchers to get other species affected by human-caused climate change protected by the ESA."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/02/us/water-infrastructure-failure-us-cities-climate/index.html,These five cities could be one natural disaster away from a catastrophic water crisis,09/02/2023,                                                 Here are five cities or regions across the country that show signs of vulnerability under a rapidly warming planet – from coastal flooding in New York to saltwater intrusion in California’s groundwater.                                             ,"Rachel Ramirez and Eric Levenson, CNN","When torrential rainfall in August 2022 pushed the Pearl River in Mississippi to surge well beyond its banks, floodwaters spilled into the suburbs of Jackson and led an already-hobbled water treatment plant to fail. It was the final stroke in what experts described as a yearslong issue in the making, which eventually left tens of thousands of residents in the city without clean drinking water for weeks. What happened in Jackson, experts say, is a bellwether for what’s to come if America continues to kick the can down the road in addressing its aging and crumbling water infrastructure. The climate crisis threatens to make those issues even more pressing. When sea levels rise, summers become hotter or heavy rains lead to more flooding, the country’s water infrastructure – largely built last century and only designed to last roughly 75 years – will be more strained than ever, threatening a system vital to human life. At the rate our climate is changing, America’s water infrastructure is not equipped to handle the challenges to come, said Erik Olson, the senior strategic director for health and food with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “America’s water system relies on last century’s infrastructure that often can’t protect our health from hazardous contaminants,” Olson told CNN. “And our outdated system is completely unprepared for this century’s challenges of intense heat, drought and flooding.” The American Society of Civil Engineers gave America’s drinking water infrastructure a C-minus in its 2021 report card. And climate change-fueled extreme weather disasters promises a gauntlet of even tougher tests. The 2021 infrastructure legislation signed by President Joe Biden includes about $30 billion for drinking water, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act another $550 million for water infrastructure. But experts say those figures are not enough to make up for decades of disinvestment and mismanagement across the country. In Jackson alone, it could cost $1 billion to $2 billion to repair the water system, and the water industry estimates that the total nationwide costs will top $1 trillion. “Federal investments account for just a few percent of the total needs,” Olson said. To better understand the issue, CNN examined five cities or regions across the country that show signs of vulnerability under a rapidly warming planet – from coastal flooding in New York to saltwater intrusion in California’s groundwater. Buffalo water officials don’t have to wonder too hard about its worst-case scenario. It basically happened last year. A devastating winter storm dropped more than 50 inches of snow on the city in December, knocking out power, making roads impassable and killing 46 people in the area. The high winds from the storm generated a phenomenon known as a “seiche,” in which water from the west end of Lake Erie near Toledo was pushed east, creating high water levels and coastal flooding in Buffalo. The blizzard and seiche flooding threatened to knock out power to Buffalo’s water treatment plant, located precariously along Lake Erie. Thankfully, the plant has multiple backup sources, and the plant employees toughed out the storm, keeping the plant online and delivered clean water to residents. But Oluwole “OJ” McFoy, the general manager of the Buffalo Sewer Water Authority, said it was a “nightmare scenario” for the city and a warning of how rising water levels could impact its water infrastructure. “(If) we don’t have power, we can’t do anything. And we’ve seen those high winds, especially those associated with many of these high lake levels, knock out power, and we’ve had to use our backup power as well,” he said. “Everything for us is just about being resilient, but those things cost money, and you have to make sure that as part of your capital expenditure that you’re building that resiliency into your system.” The non-profit organization Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper has teamed up with the city on a study of the city’s coastal resiliency. Climate change has made the flooding issues worse in recent years, as the average water level has risen and the lake no longer completely freezes over in winter. “That perfect storm – flooding, coastal storms, lack of ice coverage, fluctuating lake levels, erosion – all of that is being exacerbated from the effects of climate change,” said Kerrie Gallo, the deputy executive director of Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper. The Gulf Coast is no stranger to devastating storms. But in Gulf cities that aren’t as populous or well-invested in, a hurricane could trigger a water infrastructure crisis. Residents of Prichard, Alabama, believe their city – a less than 10-minute drive from Mobile – could be “the next Jackson,” said Carletta Davis, president of the non-profit We Matter Eight Mile Community Association. From intensifying storms to leaking water lines that are never addressed, as well as racial injustice, the issues they face are multifold, she said. Prichard’s infrastructure on average leaked 56% of the water coming in from reservoirs each month from April 2021 through November 2022, according to a report from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. “This water system has completely failed,” Davis told CNN. “Hurricanes are one of our biggest threats, along with heavy rainfall, coastal erosion and flooding,” she said. “And when it rains, we have sewage overflows, buses can’t even get kids from school to their homes, and the streets are completely impassable.” Prichard is a predominantly Black and low-income city, and the historical legacy of disinvestment and racial injustice remains baked into the decisions made for the city’s residents, including repairing and upgrading its water systems, said Catherine Coleman Flowers, founder of the Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice. “The problem we are seeing in Prichard is similar to the issues we see plaguing communities around the country,” Flowers told CNN. “Failing water and sanitation infrastructure that hasn’t been repaired in decades due to lack of funding and discriminatory distribution of public funds have led to issues that can spread diseases and threaten public health.” The impacts and financial burden of Prichard’s failing and aging infrastructure then gets passed on to the residents in these communities, she added. Ramsey Sprague, president of the Mobile Environmental Justice Action Coalition, said it’s just a matter of time until another storm hits the Gulf and shuts Prichard’s entire water system down. “We’re staring down the barrel of a gun,” Sprague said. “With these infrastructure challenges in cities like Prichard, there are whole populations that are teetering on the brink of total collapse that can’t be easily addressed.” As of August, after years of calling on city leaders to solve their escalating problem, Prichard’s water utility board began the process of eminent domain – condemning residents from their homes so they can work to fix the water system. It’s a move residents and community advocates are fighting. Lead pipes were commonly used in water systems across the US until they were outlawed in 1986 due to the danger of lead poisoning. But in cities like St. Louis, which has seen a stark population decline since its heyday in the mid-20th century, some of these older lead pipes remain and have the potential to leech the toxic chemical into the water supply. Even low levels of lead exposure are dangerous for children and can damage the blood cells and nervous system or cause other disabilities. The Environmental Protection Agency has called lead poisoning the “number one environmental health threat in the US for children ages 6 and younger.” The state of Missouri is fourth in the nation in terms of lead service lines per capita, according to data from the NRDC. St. Louis has tried to remove these lines – but doesn’t know for sure where they all are. “Just because St. Louis is an older city and it was a very commonly used plumbing material, especially for the smaller lead service lines from the water mains into people’s homes, they were just very widely used,” said Rachel Rimmerman, the director of business and outreach at the Water Access, Technology, Environment and Resources Institute at Saint Louis University. “It also wasn’t very common practice to have an inventory of where those lines are.” Furthering the problem, climate change has led to more intense flooding and storms, and that has the potential to damage older, weaker water systems like in St. Louis, said Jason Knouft, a biology professor at Saint Louis University studying the impact of climate change. “These things were constructed based on a smaller population and less intense storm events, and so as we move forward … it’s a broader problem with our water infrastructure,” he said. The issue has not gone unheeded. The massive 2021 infrastructure law includes $15 billion for lead service line replacement, according to the EPA. Roughly an hour from California’s Bay Area and less than a mile from the Pacific Ocean, Kelli and Tim Hutton purchased a half an acre property in the Central Coast town of Moss Landing last summer. As with many others living in the area, they heavily rely on their private well for water. After moving into the new home with their newborn baby, the Huttons heard other residents were concerned about high levels of saltwater intrusion, being so near the ocean. Rising sea level and California’s whiplash weather have been impacting their water table, with seawater seeping in and causing pipes to corrode, making water undrinkable. The threat of saltwater intrusion increases during a drought, which California is facing more of under a worsening climate crisis. When water supply is low, groundwater is over-pumped from coastal aquifers, disrupting the balance between inland freshwater and ocean water. As groundwater levels drop, saltwater seeps in and fills in the gaps in the soil where freshwater used to be. It’s not just drought. Storm surge and floods can also push saltwater far inland, according to the US Department of Agriculture. And with climate change increasing the potential for weather whiplash, dramatic shifts in periods of drought and high precipitation, in California, saltwater intrusion is becoming an increasing threat for people living along the coast like the Huttons. “We really need to be proactive about finding ways to conserve our water as far as we’re using it, whether that’s recycled water purposes or drip irrigation,” Tim said. “If we don’t take care of it now, it’s only a resource that’s going to be with us for so long. If our table starts drying up, then we’re going to be out of luck.” This part of the Central Coast is also surrounded by farms that have been using decades’ worth of fertilizers which turn into toxic chemicals. For the Huttons, water quality tests show their private well actually contained nitrate levels five times the government’s safe level for drinking. “It’s been pretty uncomfortable and kind of nerve-wracking, especially when it’s like bath time and babies open their mouths when they’re in the water,” Kelli told CNN. Hurricane Maria wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico in 2017, leaving much of the island territory without power for month. And because Puerto Rico’s water infrastructure relies heavily on the electric grid to operate, many residents were left without running water in their homes for just as long. It gave a glimpse of how frail Puerto Rico’s water system can be during an extreme weather disaster. But what makes the infrastructure even more vulnerable is its lifespan and disrepair, said Félix I. Aponte-Ortiz, an urban environmental planner and retired professor at the University of Puerto Rico. “The transmission is fragile, and it’s very subject to hurricane and huge precipitation,” Aponte-Ortiz told CNN. “Every time we have a hurricane or a tropical storm, we have a problem with the electric system. The potable water system is the same; they’re very old.” Estimates show that 60% of the city’s water mains in San Juan – which sources its water from both reservoirs and groundwater aquifers – are over 50 years old, according to a 2019 report by the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority. These older pipes are more likely to leak and break, which could trigger water shortages as well as water quality problems. The Natural Resources Defense Council along with local groups released a report in 2017 that found nearly all of Puerto Rico’s residents were drinking water from systems that violated the Safe Drinking Water Act, and that almost 70% of people on the island were served by water sources that violated the policy’s health standards – the highest of any state or territory, NRDC’s Olson said. Water repairs and upgrades have always been costly across the country. But in Puerto Rico, every extreme weather event compounds the burden of the historical legacy of federal disinvestment in US territories, making repairs an even greater struggle."

It’s the latest example of how extreme weather, exacerbated by climate change, impacted major North American attractions this summer. The largest theme park companies — Six Flags (SIX),  SeaWorld and Cedar Point-parent Cedar Fair — all were upended by extreme weather, including deadly flooding in the Northeast, record-breaking heat in the Southwest and California, and wildfires in Canada. Extreme heat in Florida also disrupted attendance at Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando this summer. These attractions are dependent on weather and climate change poses significant risks to their businesses. Theme parks are building indoor rides and changing ticket policies to respond to brutal weather conditions. “Weather was the clear driver of weakness in the period across regional theme parks,” Paul Golding, an analyst at Macquarie Research, said in a note to clients. Golding has lowered his estimates for the theme park industry because of growing risks from extreme weather. Cedar Fair (FUN), which also owns Canada’s Wonderland in Ontario and Knott’s Berry Farm in California, said that Canadian wildfires and extreme heat in California impacted attendance by 300,000 visits during its latest quarter. “Attendance isn’t just driven by the weather in the moment,” but the weather when customers buy tickets months in advance, Brian Witherow, Cedar Fair’s chief financial officer, said on an earnings call last month. SeaWorld (SEAS) attendance fell 2% last quarter from the same time a year prior as fewer people visited its outdoor water parks. The decline was “primarily due to significantly adverse weather,” including rainfall and the fallout from Canadian wildfires, SeaWorld’s finance chief James Forrester said. The company has been hit hard by extreme weather in recent years that have caused park closures and attendance drops in Florida, Texas and Virginia. SeaWorld warns in its annual report to investors that extreme weather events could cause it to “incur significant costs.” “The series of extreme weather events experienced in recent years presents an alarming trend,” SeaWorld said. “Changing climate conditions could add to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and create additional uncertainty.” “For example, attendance at our parks in 2022 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Ian which led to closures at our parks in Florida and Virginia for a combined 15 operating days,” the annual report added. Meanwhile, Six Flags said its attendance growth fell short of its expectations because of unusually high rainfall in the Northeast and a record heat wave in the South. “When we have a good day versus a bad weather day, the attendance lift is notable,” Six Flags finance chief Gary Mick said on an earnings call last month. Six Flags is adding more shaded structures, water misters, splash zones and air-conditioned areas. As the weather “continues to be hotter every year,” Six Flags will build more indoor and air-conditioned rides and restaurants, Mick said. Premier Rides, a company that has built roller coasters for Six Flags and other amusement parks, is using more steel in designs to make them last longer in hotter and more extreme conditions, according to the Wall Street Journal. Theme parks are also beginning to change their policies to offer free return tickets when temperatures hit extreme levels, a sign that parks believe heat waves could hurt attendance in the future. SeaWorld last month expanded its weather guarantee policy to cover heat indexes above 110."

","Rachel Ramirez and Gabe Cohen, CNN","An intense, late-summer heat wave is putting pressure on schools, students and the education system this week as temperatures climbed into the triple digits in parts of the Northeast and Midwest — record-breaking highs for early September in some places. Heat is affecting classrooms more than in the past as the planet warms and temperatures creep higher at the beginning and end of summer, pushing dangerous heat into the school year. This pressure is especially high at schools that don’t have reliable air conditioning, and many districts this week are canceling classes, adjusting schedules and forgoing after-school activities to keep kids out of hot classrooms. Heat days could become the new snow days as global temperatures rise and summer gets longer. Schools now need to prepare for extremes on both ends of the spectrum, said Kevin Lanza, an assistant professor at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health. “There will be higher numbers of days with extreme heat into the future and they will start trickling into what we consider the typical school year,” Lanza told CNN. Heat isn’t just a health risk – it also challenges learning: A 2018 study from the Harvard Kennedy School showed that in schools without AC, students learning over the course of the year dropped 1% for every 1-degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature. Schools are not equipped to deal with the extreme weather they face, said Laura Schifter, a senior fellow at the non-profit think tank Aspen Institute and lead of This is Planet Ed. “Schools really need to be thinking about how climate change is going to impact them and how they can develop and build plans in place to adequately respond,” Schifter told CNN. Patricia Burton walked in the scorching hot sun on Tuesday to pick up her 9-year-old son, Delano, after he was dismissed from City Springs Elementary School in Baltimore three hours earlier than usual. Burton told CNN she worries about her son’s well-being, knowing that outside temperatures are blistering, and the school does not have adequate air conditioning. Most of all, she worries because Delano has asthma. “I worry about everybody’s kids that go here, because it’s not just mine, it’s all of our babies that’s in this heat,” Burton said. “Why not give them air? Why not help them want to come and be productive and do what they need to do to learn? They can’t learn in the heat.” “That’s a lot on them and the teachers,” she added. Baltimore temperatures could hit 101 degrees on Wednesday, the National Weather Service says. It has only climbed to 100 degrees three other times since 1872 — and it could happen twice this week. Baltimore City Public Schools — including Delano’s — announced early dismissal for multiple locations without air conditioning on Tuesday and Wednesday. Schools in the Midwest, including in Milwaukee, Chicago and Detroit, also changed schedules this week or closed due to punishing heat. And Philadelphia is facing four consecutive days with temperatures over 95 degrees Fahrenheit, which has never happened during the month of September in the records dating back to 1873. In a letter sent to family members, the School District of Philadelphia announced that dozens of schools “without air conditioning” or with “inadequate cooling” would be dismissed three hours early on Tuesday and Wednesday. “We have been working with urgency over the past five years to install updated air conditioning systems and the extensive electrical systems that support them in our schools,” Oz Hill, chief operations officer for the school district, wrote in the letter. “We will continue to expedite this work … in order to eliminate extreme heat as a disruption to in-person learning.” While climate change is a major contributor to these school disruptions, experts tell CNN another reason is that many of the country’s school buildings are “outdated” and were built in a climate that was considerably different. “There are a lot of challenges to just updating these school buildings and making them function to the increased heat that we have now,” Schifter said. “It’s not as simple as just throwing an air conditioning unit on a building if the building itself is not built to withstand the climate that it exists in today.” In some states, community advocates have launched campaigns to help make schools healthier and safer for students and teachers even as the climate crisis worsens, while also helping them break their reliance on fossil fuel energy. Some solutions include changing heat-trapping asphalt in playgrounds to green spaces with more shade or installing heat pumps, instead of traditional fossil fuel-powered air conditioners to cool buildings. “This is where you have to shift resources to this problem, whether that’s within that region or at the federal level,” Lanza said. “Learning in an environment that has safe and comfortable temperatures should be a certain type of human right, and I think that we’re not meeting that with our current setup.” CNN’s Brandon Miller and Amy Simonson contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","As heat waves continue to bake parts of the world, scientists are reporting that this blistering, deadly summer was the hottest on record – and by a significant margin. June to August was the planet’s warmest such period since records began in 1940, according to data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. The global average temperature this summer was 16.77 degrees Celsius (62.19 Fahrenheit), according to Copernicus, which is 0.66 degrees Celsius above the 1990 to 2020 average – beating the previous record, set in August 2019, by nearly 0.3 degrees Celsius. Typically these records, which track the average air temperature across the entire world, are broken by hundredths of a degree. This is the first set of scientific data to confirm what many had believed was inevitable. It’s been a searingly hot summer for swaths of the Northern Hemisphere – including parts of the United States, Europe and Japan – with record-breaking heat waves and unprecedented ocean temperatures. The planet experienced its hottest June on record, followed by the hottest July – both breaking previous records by large margins. August was also the warmest such month on record, according to the new Copernicus data, and warmer than every other month this year except for July. The global average temperature for the month was 16.82 degrees Celsius – 0.31 degrees warmer than the previous record set in 2016. “The dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,” said António Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, in a statement about the Copernicus data. “Scientists have long warned what our fossil fuel addiction will unleash. Our climate is imploding faster than we can cope with extreme weather events hitting every corner of the planet” Both July and August are estimated to have been 1.5 degrees warmer than pre-industrial levels, according to Copernicus, a key threshold scientists have long warned the world must stay under to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. While scientists are more focused on long-term global temperature rises, these temporary breaches are an important preview of what the world can expect summers to look like at 1.5 degrees of warming. “The Northern Hemisphere just had a summer of extremes – with repeated heatwaves fueling devastating wildfires, harming health, disrupting daily lives and wreaking a lasting toll on the environment,”  Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, said in a statement. Countries in the Southern Hemisphere have also experienced startlingly warm winters, with well-above average temperatures recorded in Australia, several South American countries and Antarctica. Global average ocean temperatures, too, have been off the charts, helping strengthen major hurricanes in the Atlantic and typhoons in the Pacific. In July, a sudden marine heat wave off the coast of Florida saw the ocean reach “hot tub” temperatures. While in June, parts of the North Atlantic experienced a “totally unprecedented” marine heat wave with water temperatures up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than usual. Every single day from the end of July to the end of August has seen ocean temperatures exceed the previous record set in 2016, according to Copernicus. Whether this year will end up being the planet’s warmest on record is not yet clear, but it looks certain to come extremely close. With four months of the year remaining, 2023 currently ranks as the second warmest on record, according to Copernicus, only 0.01 degrees Celsius below 2016, which is currently the warmest year on record. Scientists say next year is likely to be even hotter, given the arrival of El Niño, a natural climate fluctuation that brings warmer-than-average sea-surface temperatures and influences weather. “This El Niño is developing in a warmer ocean than any previous El Niño so we are watching with interest how this event develops in terms of strength and impact,” Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, told CNN Burgess said the summer had been one of tumbling records and it would only get worse if the world continues to burn planet-heating fossil fuels. “The scientific evidence is overwhelming – we will continue to see more climate records and more intense and frequent extreme weather events impacting society and ecosystems, until we stop emitting greenhouse gases,” she said in a statement. The Copernicus data was released the same day as the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its State of the Climate report for 2022 – an annual health check-up for the planet. It found record ocean heat and global sea levels last year, and unprecedented concentrations of planet-heating pollution in the atmosphere – with carbon pollution reaching the highest levels in at least 800,000 years, according to the report."

","Jacopo Prisco, CNN","The inaugural Africa Climate Summit drew to a close on Wednesday, with the host, Kenya’s president William Ruto, saying that a total of $23 billion had been pledged to green projects by governments, investors, development banks and philanthropists. The summit, which focussed on driving green growth and climate finance solutions, concluded with the “Nairobi Declaration,” a call from African leaders for urgent action on climate change, which included a request for new global taxes on carbon pollution as well as phasing out coal use and ending fossil fuel subsidies. African heads of state and government warned that many African countries face “disproportionate burdens and risks” from climate change, and called on the global community “to act with urgency” in reducing planet-heating pollution and supporting the continent in addressing the problem. “Africa is not historically responsible for global warming, but bears the brunt of its effect, impacting lives, livelihoods, and economies,” the leaders said in the joint declaration. Among the most eye-catching finance announcements, the United Arab Emirates pledged $4.5 billion to clean energy initiatives in Africa. The pledge was announced by Sultan Al-Jaber, the head of the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, and the government-owned renewable energy company, Masdar. He will also serve as the president of COP28, the annual UN climate meeting that will take place in Dubai starting in November. “It is our ambition that this will launch a new transformative partnership to jumpstart a pipeline of bankable clean energy projects in this important continent,” Al-Jaber said, adding that the investment could lead to the generation of 15 gigawatts of clean energy by 2030. Africa’s current clean energy generation capacity is 56 gigawatts. The initiative marks a positive development, according to Yemi Osinbajo, former vice president of Nigeria and now an advisor for the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), a consortium that helps developing countries shift to clean energy. “It reflects a commitment to addressing the pressing issue of climate change by investing in renewable and sustainable energy solutions in Africa, which is essential for reducing emissions, creating jobs and driving social and economic development,” he told CNN. Germany announced 450 million euros (about $481 million) of climate finance pledges, and and the US pledged $30 million to support climate resilient food security efforts across Africa. Hundreds of millions more were offered following an initiative to boost Africa’s carbon credit production 19-fold by 2030. Carbon credits are used by companies to offset carbon emissions, and are usually generated by financing projects that aim to reduce carbon pollution in the atmosphere, such as tree planting, or reduce planet-heating pollution by promoting switching to renewable energy, especially in developing countries. “Carbon credits could be a game-changer for Africa,” said Osinbajo. “They have the potential to unlock billions for the climate finance needs of African economies while expanding energy access, creating jobs, protecting biodiversity, and driving climate action.” However, campaigners in Nairobi protested against this approach, arguing that carbon credits are flawed and allow wealthy countries and companies to continue to pollute. In the joint declaration, African leaders called upon the global community “to act with urgency in reducing emissions, fulfilling its obligations, keeping past promises, and supporting the continent in addressing climate change.” They pointed to steps to achieve this, including accelerating efforts to reduce emissions, honoring the commitment to provide $100 billion in annual climate finance as promised at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, and upholding commitments to “a fair and accelerated process of phasing down coal, and abolishment of all fossil fuel subsidies.” “Decarbonizing the global economy is also an opportunity to contribute to equality and shared prosperity,” the leaders said. According to Osinbajo, the summit provided a “new framing” of Africa, not as victim, but as a key solution to the climate crisis. He said that “with its untapped renewable energy potential, the world’s youngest and fastest growing workforce, and critical minerals and resources, (Africa) has the fundamentals to become a cost-competitive green industrial hub, greening both African and global consumption and removing carbon from the air.”"

On this visit in late August, she’s being treated along with her two sons, aged 4 and 12. All three are recovering from a disease that has long devastated their region. “Malaria has hit my family hard. In a month, I use about $35 on drugs and the following month, one of them falls sick again,” she said. “Right now we’re in hospital, they are not in school and I haven’t been able to open my business,” she told CNN. Achieng lives in Kisumu, Kenya, a hot and humid lakeside region where conditions are ideal for malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. She’s one of 14 million Kenyans who live in areas where malaria is endemic and who struggle with the burden of a disease which kills an estimated 10,000 people in the country each year. Now there are fears that the malaria is spreading to new communities in the country – and just at a time when the development of the world’s first mosquito vaccine is raising hopes the deadly disease could one day be eradicated. The reason: climate change. Mosquitoes thrive in warm and humid conditions and the human-caused climate crisis is fueling more frequent and severe heat waves as well as storms that leave behind pools of water where the insects love to breed. In Kenya, as elsewhere in Africa, it means malaria-transmitting mosquitoes are threatening communities where outbreaks have previously been rare. Scientists from Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) are investigating reports of malaria cases in people who had not recently traveled out of areas previously considered “malaria-free.” This includes places like the Kikuyu highlands, on the outskirts of the capital Nairobi, where scientists found malaria-transmitting mosquitoes for the first time. A significant increase in temperatures in the area - about 1.3 degrees Celsius over the last 60 years- could be a driving factor, they said in a recent report. Steve Ngugi, a 45-year-old Kikuyu resident, was shocked to learn he had tested positive for malaria in February despite not having traveled to a malaria zone. It was the first time in his life that he contracted the disease. With little or no immunity, malaria left him extremely sick, weak, and fearing for his life for three months. “The behavior of the mosquito that transmits malaria is changing rapidly and it’s changing because of global warming,” said Gitahi Githinji, group CEO of the nonprofit Amref Health Africa and who is based in Nairobi. “And we are seeing that actually the public health system is not prepared for this resurgence,” he told CNN. It is a problem that affects many countries in Africa, which shoulders 95% of malaria infections, killing more than 600,000 people annually – most of them children. A recent report found that malaria-transmitting mosquitoes have reached new heights in sub-Saharan Africa, on average climbing 21 feet in elevation every year over the last 120 years. It’s a pace that follows climate change, according to the report authors. “Where cooler places now are becoming warmer, we are seeing increased malaria rate in those areas because of mosquito multiplication,” said Richard Munang, climate change program coordinator for the UN’s environmental agency. Experts warn other continents are at risk too, as the climate crisis accelerates. “What is happening in Africa will gradually see itself elsewhere, because with a warming climate, with the changing temperatures, malaria mosquitoes are migrating to other areas that are conducive for them,” said Munang. As the insects move to different territories, people will be displaced, he said. There is good news when it comes to combating malaria. Scientists and health experts have made strides in tackling the disease over the last two decades using a wide range of preventative measures. In Kenya, increased distribution of insecticide-treated bednets, preventative doses of antimalarial drugs, and nation-wide awareness campaigns have contributed to a dramatic decrease in malaria. Now with the introduction of the world’s first malaria vaccine, hailed as a breakthrough, there is talk of one day reaching eradication. Around 1.7 million children in Kenya, Ghana, and Malawi have benefited from the vaccine since its pilot roll-out in 2019, resulting in a substantial drop in severe malaria and child deaths. So it’s a bitter irony that as Kenya celebrates hard-earned gains, new malaria species and cases are popping up in areas historically deemed low-risk. “We were at the verge of bringing cases to minimum, to non-detectable levels,” said Damaris Matoke-Muhia, principal research scientist at the KEMRI’s Malaria Lab. But climate change means they are seeing more mosquitoes than before, she told CNN. “We’re seeing new species. We are seeing [malaria] going to places where we didn’t expect,” she said. “We are taken back to zero,” she added. If global temperatures keep rising, Matoke-Muhia said, “it’s likely that our story will change about malaria.” “If this continues like this” she added, “we have to go back to the drawing board, start thinking of novel interventions.”"

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","During this summer of dangerous, record-shattering heat almost no one on Earth escaped climate change-fueled temperatures, a new analysis has found. Researchers from climate research group Climate Central mapped the influence of climate change on temperatures in more than 200 countries and territories. They found that between June and August, 98% of the global population — 7.95 billion people — experienced high temperatures made at least twice as likely by climate change. “In every country we could analyze, including the Southern Hemisphere where this is the coolest time of year, we saw temperatures that would be difficult — and in some cases nearly impossible — without human-caused climate change,” Andrew Pershing, lead author of the report and vice president of science for Climate Central, said in a statement. Nearly half of humanity, around 3.9 billion people, experienced 30 days or more of heat made at least three times more likely by planet-warming pollution, according to the report. This included the US states of Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and Florida. But the impacts were much starker in poorer countries. Those that produce the lowest amounts of planet-heating pollution experienced between three to four times more summer days “with very strong climate fingerprints” than the world’s largest economies, the report found. The report findings help show the impacts of climate change on human lives, Pershing told CNN. “There has always been a big gap between the global statistics that scientists use to track climate change and the daily experience of people around the world,” he said. One of the big lessons from this summer is that there’s nowhere to hide from the heat, he added. “There’s no break and there’s no escape. You look around, there really is not a place in the world that is safe from climate change. I think we’d all like to imagine that we could move somewhere and everything would be great, but every place is feeling that impact.” The report comes on the heels of new data released Wednesday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service which found that this summer was the planet’s hottest on record by a significant margin. June, July and August all broke global records for the hottest such months. Both July and August were 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, according Copernicus — marking the breach, albeit temporary, of a key threshold scientists have long warned the world must stay under to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. While scientists are more focused on long-term global temperature trends, these temporary breaches provide an alarming preview of what the world can expect summers to be like at 1.5 degrees of warming. Humanity’s exposure to heat will only increase unless planet-warming pollution is cut to zero, Pershing said. “While this summer is shocking, it isn’t surprising. We knew it was coming. And we know that as long as we keep burning coal, oil, and natural gas, our chance of encountering unusually hot conditions will continue to grow.” CNN’s Laura Paddison contributed to this report."

The dismal poll numbers come as Biden faces broadly negative job ratings overall and widespread concerns that his age, at 80 years old, might affect his current level of physical and mental competence. According to the poll, a broad 67% majority of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wish they had an alternative to Biden — and 46% of registered voters say that any Republican presidential nominee would be a better choice than Biden in 2024. While we are still around 14 months away from the election, it’s a safe bet that Biden will be the party’s nominee, assuming no other credible Democrats will step up to challenge him. However, analysts are cautioning his current unpopularity may give former President Donald Trump his shot at reclaiming power. Hurricane Lee has strengthened into a major Category 5 storm, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 160 mph as it spins over the Atlantic. The storm system is well east of the Caribbean but could still become a dangerous hurricane over the southwestern Atlantic early next week, according to the National Hurricane Center. Computer model trends for Lee have shown the hurricane taking a turn to the north early next week, though it’s still too soon to know how close it will get to the US. Meteorologists say that any potential impact on the East Coast will become more clear as Lee moves to the west in the coming days. World leaders have begun arriving in India for the annual G20 summit, where they will meet to address several pressing crises facing the globe. President Joe Biden and other US allies are set to arrive today at the forum in New Delhi, but Russian President Vladimir Putin and China’s President Xi Jinping are not expected to attend. Amid heightened international tensions, the two autocratic leaders are skipping the summit for various reasons, but analysts say both absences display clear fractures coursing through the gathering. Xi has never missed a G20 summit since taking power in 2012, which may mark a shift in how China views the G20 — a premier global forum that brings together economies representing 80% of global GDP. Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the Supreme Court is working on “concrete steps” to address ethics issues at the high court following several news stories on justices’ unreported luxury travel and relationships with political donors. ProPublica, the Associated Press and other outlets have reported on issues concerning justices’ undisclosed trips on private jets, lavish vacations and the use of taxpayer-funded staff to perform tasks related to book ventures. The comments from Kavanaugh come weeks before the start of a new term for the Supreme Court and critics, including Democrats in Congress, are pressuring the justices to develop a code of conduct specific to the justices themselves. Planet-warming pollution made this summer’s heat twice as likely for most people on Earth, a new analysis has found.

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","In the eight years since the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, the world’s nations have not done enough to cut pollution and avert catastrophic levels of warming, according to the first United Nations scorecard since Paris, released on Friday. As the world’s nations gather for COP28 in Dubai in late November to measure how much progress has been made on bringing down global emissions since Paris, Friday’s assessment by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change shows the world is still seriously off-track. One of the key facets of COP28 will be what’s known as a “global stocktake,” measuring how quickly the world’s nations are meeting the emissions goals set out in Paris, to help bring down the temperature of a rapidly warming globe. The report warns there “is a rapidly narrowing window to raise ambition and implement existing commitments,” but the world is currently not in line with the temperature targets outlined in the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius, and ideally below the critical warming threshold of 1.5 degrees. The planet has already warmed about 1.2 degrees above preindustrial levels; during this year’s summer of record heat, it hit 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels. This year’s sweltering summer broke global temperature records. June to August was the planet’s warmest such period since records began in 1940, according to data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. While the UN report finds the Paris Agreement “has driven near-universal climate action” from each country and put a major focus on lowering emissions, the actions themselves from countries aren’t matching up to the crisis. “Against forecasts made prior to its adoption, the Paris Agreement has led to contributions that significantly reduce forecasts of future warming, yet the world is not on track to meet the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement,” the UN authors wrote. In a statement, COP28 president designate Dr. Sultan Al Jaber called on governments and businesses to deliver “real and actionable commitments to address climate change.” “Today’s global stocktake provides clear direction on how we can meet the expectations of the Paris Agreement by taking decisive action in this critical decade,” Al Jaber said in the statement. Experts said COP28 represents a pivotal moment for the globe to collectively rise to the occasion, as climate-driven extreme weather and deadly heat has battered countries all over the world. The UN report is “a call for radical and immediate action,” Tom Evans, policy adviser on climate diplomacy and geopolitics at think tank E3G, said in a statement. “Agreeing on a global rapid response plan at COP28 can turn the tide on climate action.” Evans called for countries to scale up renewable energy and phase out fossil fuels. But getting the world’s nations to agree on language phasing out all fossil fuels has proved extremely difficult in the past and could run into challenges at this year’s summit – hosted by oil and gas-rich nation the United Arab Emirates."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Hurricane Lee rapidly intensified at a historic pace into a Category 5 storm Thursday night, adding to a spate of extremely intense hurricanes this year and in recent decades which experts say is a symptom of the climate crisis. Lee is now the eighth Category 5 storm in the North Atlantic since 2016, which means 20% of Category 5 hurricanes on record in the basin have occurred in the last seven years, a CNN analysis of NOAA’s hurricane database shows. This year alone, Category 5 storms have already appeared in all seven ocean basins where tropical cyclones form, including Hurricane Jova, which also rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 storm earlier this week. “The increase in Category 4 or 5 storms, especially that we’ve seen over the last couple years due to the increase in rapid intensification, is a telltale sign of climate change, which is exactly what we expect to see in a warmer world,” Kevin Reed, a hurricane expert and professor at Stony Brook University’s school of marine and atmospheric sciences, told CNN. Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Brooklyn-based nonprofit First Street Foundation, agrees. He cautions the NOAA database had not fully counted storms prior to the satellite era, and while advances in technology have made it easier to measure hurricanes, it is still difficult to determine the real trend. Still, he said at the breakneck pace at which the oceans are warming, high intensity tropical cyclones are likely occurring more often. “It is very likely that there are more Category 5 storms now than there were 40 years ago,” Kossin told CNN. The primary way in which storms reach Category 4 or 5 strength is by undergoing a rapid intensification process — when a storm’s winds strengthen rapidly by at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less, said Reed. It’s just one of the ways experts say the climate crisis is making hurricanes more dangerous, as warmer waters allow for storms to strengthen quicker and reach higher categories on the hurricane wind speed scale. More than 90% of warming around the globe over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “The short of it is, as the sea surface temperatures warm, because of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, the likelihood that any event will undergo rapid intensification will increase,” Reed said. Rapid intensification has been happening more and more as storms are approaching landfall, making them harder to prepare for. Hurricane Idalia rapidly intensified by 55 mph in 24 hours before landfall along Florida’s Big Bend as a Category 4 hurricane late last month. And in the North Atlantic, where ocean temperatures have been off the charts, storms like Lee have had quite a feast. Lee’s winds increased 85 mph in 24 hours, the third-fastest a storm has rapidly intensified on record in the Atlantic Ocean, according to NOAA research meteorologist John Kaplan. “There is little doubt that the exceptionally warm ocean waters we’re seeing have a human fingerprint on them,” Kossin said. “Add to this the warming effects of the El Niño happening this year and we have a recipe for breaking a lot of temperature records.” Kossin noted this is especially true in the eastern North Pacific, where warming from a growing El Niño is most concentrated. “Jova is sitting in the middle of this, and the warm water certainly fueled the rapid intensification,” he added. One thing is for certain: As the world’s oceans continue to warm, experts say the frequency at which these top-of-scale storms can occur and intensify will only increase."

Vanuatu led a campaign to ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to issue an advisory opinion on countries’ obligations to address climate change. The UN General Assembly in March voted to refer the case to the ICJ, which will issue an opinion in 2024."

Next year’s growth has been revised to 1.4% from 1.7%. The commission blamed weak domestic demand, dampened by high inflation, as well as rising interest rates for the downgrades. But it added that there was “formidable uncertainty” over its latest forecast, with extreme weather among the “downside” risks. Tourism can account for as much as a fifth of annual GDP in some countries in the region. Europeans are already starting to rethink where to vacation in the future after this year’s scorching temperatures in southern Europe and the hottest summer ever recorded on the continent in 2022. The European Travel Commission, an association of tourism organizations, said in July that the number of European tourists planning to travel to Mediterranean destinations in the summer and fall this year had dropped 10% compared with the same period in 2022. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Ireland and Denmark, where the weather is milder, had seen a “surge in popularity,” the ETC noted. Travelers from outside the EU may likewise lose their taste for vacations in Italy and Greece, both of which have been battling wildfires. A spokesperson at ForwardKeys, a travel data company, told CNN in July that “there has been a shift in preference towards cooler and more northern destinations” among UK travelers as a result of heat waves in continental Europe that month. Global warming could dent tourism in another way: by accelerating the erosion of beaches and amplifying wildfires that rip through forests — both part of Europe’s “natural capital,” David Owen, chief economist at Saltmarsh Economics, told CNN. In a study published last October, the Bank of Italy warned that rising temperatures risked stunting growth in the EU’s third-biggest economy, with tourism and agriculture most exposed. The blistering temperatures have already been bad news for olive trees, for a second year running, with industry experts warning of skyrocketing prices and potential shortages of olive oil. In Spain, the world’s biggest olive oil producer, production has already plunged. The full extent of the damage from this year’s heat won’t be known until after harvest time in October and November, but European olive oil production could sink by 700,000 metric tons — a fall of more than 30% — compared with its five-year average, according to Kyle Holland at market research group Mintec. Construction and manufacturing are among other economic sectors vulnerable to extreme heat, said Owen at Saltmarsh Economics. “If you’re having to learn to live with temperatures topping 40 degrees [Celsius] for a few days at a time in parts of southern Europe, we don’t function very well at those sorts of temperatures, so it will impact economies more generally,” he added. Similarly to the European Commission, on Sunday the International Monetary Fund pointed to “grave risks to economic well-being” from climate change. “G20 members must lead by example in delivering on the promises of $100 billion per year for climate finance,” IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said at the Group of 20 summit in India. “Countries also need to mobilize domestic resources to finance and manage the green transition through tax reforms, effective and efficient public spending, strong fiscal institutions, and deep local debt markets.”"

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","It’s been a record-smashing year for the most expensive weather and climate disasters in the United States after severe storms, the deadly Maui wildfire and Hurricane Idalia tipped the scales last month. With four months still left in the year, the US has been hit with 23 disasters that each cost at least $1 billion, according to new data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, surpassing the previous annual record of 22 events in 2020. This year’s billion-dollar disasters have caused 253 direct and indirect fatalities and have resulted in $57.6 billion in damage, NOAA data shows. That price tag does not yet include Hurricane Idalia. NOAA is still analyzing whether other events, including drought in the South and Midwest and Tropical Storm Hilary, which hit southern California this summer, may have surpassed the billion-dollar mark. The impact of extreme weather is being amplified by decisions to build and rebuild in high-risk areas, and the events themselves are being supercharged by the climate crisis, said Rachel Cleetus, a policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “These record-breaking and sobering numbers are the latest confirmation of a worsening trend in costly disasters, many of which bear the fingerprints of climate change,” Cleetus told CNN. “In addition to climate change, our choices about how and where we develop and build are also putting more people and more valuable economic assets in harm’s way, raising the toll of disasters when they do happen.” So far, this year’s economic toll ranks well behind 2017 in total cost. That was America’s costliest disaster year on record, coming in at $383 billion, with the combination of a destructive California wildfire season and major hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria that struck within a single month. Increasingly, disasters are striking one after the other, stretching federal, state and local resources to respond to and rebuild from them, said Adam Smith, a climatologist with NOAA. “The US has been impacted by (major hurricanes) in six of the last seven years, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Michael, Laura, Ida, Ian and most recently, Idalia,” Smith said. And the effects of those storms were felt far from the Gulf Coast in the form of destructive, extreme rainfall. “More frequent disasters and shorter time intervals between disasters often result in less time and resources available to respond, recover and prepare for future events,” Smith said. The immense price tag is putting pressure on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund this year, and FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell has warned the fund would slip into the red this month if it is not replenished. The White House initially asked Congress for $12 billion in additional money to replenish the fund, then upped that request by another $4 billion due to the “intensity of disaster activity around the nation,” a FEMA spokesperson said. The Senate recently passed FEMA’s request as part of a larger set of funding bills. It is unclear when lawmakers in the House will pass those bills, which also include $24 billion in money for Ukraine – something Republican leadership in the House does not support. Criswell told CNN in a recent interview FEMA is not just dealing with severe weather disasters during the summer – it is dealing with them all year long. “It’s a year-round operational tempo like we have never seen before,” Criswell said. FEMA recently announced $3 billion in climate resilience grants, funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law, to help make various communities more resilient to stronger storms, higher flood waters and wildfires. Cleetus said as the costs of disasters continue to mount, lawmakers need to spend more on helping make buildings and infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of extreme weather, including stronger storms and more intense heat. “This kind of a dire situation is likely to happen year after year as climate change worsens,” Cleetus said. “As a nation, we have to invest much more in getting out ahead of disasters and investing in resilience to better protect people and infrastructure, not just picking up the pieces after the fact.”"

He is the author of four books on European issues, most recently “Berlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Music, the Wall and the Birth of the New Berlin.” The opinions in this article are those of the author. View more opinion on CNN. My 12-year-old son is cutting school on September 15 — an act of non-violent civil disobedience that his mother and I approve of entirely. In fact, we’re skipping work to go with him and about a third of his 7th grade to the Global Climate Strike in Berlin — one of hundreds of climate marches happening in cities around the world this Friday and over the weekend. For five years now — since the 15-year-old Greta Thunberg sat out Friday classes in Stockholm, Sweden, setting in motion a worldwide mass movement — elementary and high school students have taken to the streets by the hundreds of thousands to call out politicos and the entire adult world for failing so egregiously to confront the climate crisis. In September 2019, millions of people, led by school kids, marched across time zones to underscore the emergency at hand. It was one of the biggest climate protests ever. And in the US, too, young people have taken this crisis into their hands. In Montana last month, a group of young people aged 5 to 22 took the state to court and won a landmark ruling that held that Montana must protect its citizens from climate change. That’s political savvy! All these determined young people deserve immense credit as they challenged the law to make their point, and in doing so turbocharged the global discussion on the climate crisis. I’ve spoken at length with many young people behind this push, including my son and his friends. It’s remarkable how politicized they are in contrast to me and my junior high friends at the same age. Politics didn’t concern us — and we certainly didn’t take the weight of an existential crisis like climate breakdown onto our shoulders. The effort they’ve expended in grasping the complex science of global warming is remarkable. Take, for example, my son’s bestie Essien who has chosen to be a vegetarian because of livestock production’s giant carbon footprint. In doing so, they’ve translated climate science into political engagement. In discussion, and on the TV and radio talk shows, the young people quake with indignation. They talk passionately of a system that is wrecking their future and which they — ineligible to vote — have no say in. They talk about “taking back their future.” They’ve opted for the school strike and other forms of civil disobedience because the decisions directly affecting their lives are made over their heads — and often it seems for the worse. As they say, they’re the ones most affected in the long term — and yet, in many cases, their young age means they’re not even able to vote. The way they can be heard is to take to the streets. And doing so on a school day packs an even harder punch — that’s civil disobedience. Calling on the findings of climate scientists, they point fingers at us, their elders and our systems — which, though they come in different shapes across the globe — all in some way oblige the fossil fuel industry, condone corporate greed and fetishize consumption. Ultimately, the logic of these young environmentalists is impeccable. They seem to understand better than many adults what they will inherit. They foresee a chaotic, broken world in which extreme weather events caused or aggravated by atmospheric greenhouse gases trigger mass migration, democratic breakdown , lower living standards and perilous social tensions. The campaign behind Thunberg’s group, Fridays for Future, has moved a mountain. The audacity of school kids going truant in the name of the planet forced the world’s powerful to finally take the crisis seriously. The EU’s landmark European Green Deal, the bloc’s bundled climate policies, and the Biden administration’s climate measures, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, are in part at least responses to the ire of their societies’ youngest members. Yet, global emissions are still rising. The world is not decarbonizing at anywhere near the pace that it must to stop extreme weather events from increasing. The world has just experienced its hottest summer on record. For all their clout, because the climate strikers are predominantly children, their truancies are not an imminent threat to the civil order. And political officials know these pre-teens and teenagers mostly won’t vote in the next set of elections. This is why adults must join them en masse this Friday and weekend, taking responsibility for a crisis that we created, and that we can help solve. The greatest threat facing our world shouldn’t be sloughed off to children and young people — which is exactly what our passivity does. Of course, there are adults marching too, some here in Germany with groups with names like Parents for Future, Scientists for Future and Entrepreneurs for Future, which lobby within their peer groups. An array of climate activist groups surged in the slipstream of the global climate strikes, and now campaign on their own and together with it. In the US, over 500 groups are backing the weekend’s climate marches in major cities. Our societies already have everything required to brake and even reverse global warming: the technology in the form of renewable energies and clean tech, the money to finance our economies’ green transformation, the smart policies to decarbonize our societies and the best practices where these policies have already worked, from California to Greece. The majority must mobilize and the global climate marches are one, high-profile, legitimate way to do it. If the kids are willing to be marked truant for the day — and bear those consequences — then we adults can skip a day of work. Everyone — young and old — who understands the severity of the crisis facing humankind and our planet should occupy the streets and public fora this weekend. We can’t leave our children to do it for us."

","Eric Zerkel, CNN","The Atlantic hurricane season typically reaches its peak this week, but record-warm ocean temperatures are fueling a hyperactive season that experts say shows no signs of slowing. The average hurricane season starts June 1 and runs through November 30, but its statistical peak is on September 10. So far this year, hurricane activity has been above average in every respect, according to Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. “It’s been a pretty busy season,” Klotzbach told CNN. “It’s not a slam dunk, but it’s looking like the season is going to be classified as above-normal.” Some fast facts on 2023 hurricanes so far: Before it started, forecasters predicted an average season, but warned of more uncertainty than usual because of a climatic battle between a burgeoning El Niño and warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures. El Niños tend to produce more wind shear – upper-level winds that can rip storms apart – but warm water can fuel their growth. Then, as the season started, ocean warmth skyrocketed to record levels and forecasters warned of explosive tropical development and a more active season, something that has come to fruition. “We saw how hot the Atlantic was and said, ‘Alright, we gotta go for it,’” said Klotzbach, whose research group creates seasonal hurricane forecasts. “Thankfully, we have a strong El Niño,” Klotzbach said, because if there was no El Niño, the season would “probably be tracking 200% of normal instead of 130% of normal.” But Klotzbach said this El Niño, which by all measures is considered strong, isn’t affecting the western Atlantic like it normally would. “Because the Atlantic is so warm, you’re not getting as much shear as you would normally get,” Klotzbach told CNN. “The entire basin is hot. If you compare it to 2005 or 2010, other big years the Atlantic had where it was really warm, we’re in a whole different ballgame this year.” The extreme ocean heat and low wind shear are having some major effects on the season, Klotzbach said. More storms are able to form than would otherwise be possible in a typical El Niño year. Even the storms that have been weakened by moderate shear – like hurricanes Franklin and Lee – were able to stay alive and restrengthen once they found more favorable conditions. “If we leave a storm out there long enough, eventually it’s going to find somewhere where the shear isn’t that strong” and it can strengthen, Klotzbach said. More frequent rapid intensification and more major hurricanes are also byproducts of this season’s ripe conditions. Idalia, Franklin and Lee all rapidly intensified in water running well above normal. “Warm water is not the only thing you need, but it does kind of load the dice toward these high-end rapid intensification events,” Klotzbach said. “You look at the water Lee was tracking over, it should have been at 28 degrees Celsius instead they’re 30 (degrees Celsius) – it’s like rocket fuel.” The season isn’t over yet – 90% of hurricane season activity happens from mid-August until mid-October – and Klotzbach said the next two weeks still look like they could produce more storms. Beyond that point, it’s anyone’s guess, Klotzbach said, but an Atlantic tinderbox has already proven full of surprises this season. “At the end of the day we’ve learned even in a strong El Niño, if you get the Atlantic warm enough it can hold its own,” Klotzbach said."

Together, they account for 18% of global apparel exports, roughly 10,000 clothing and footwear factories and more than 10.6 million manufacturing workers. But the locations are also deeply vulnerable to the climate crisis. Major garment manufacturing centers including Dhaka, Phnom Penh, Karachi, Lahore, Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi are already confronting extreme heat and humidity, the authors noted. “All of these cities are also likely to experience significant flooding,” they said. Pakistan, especially, is no stranger to extreme weather, with more than one third of the country underwater last year during its worst floods in history. Like elsewhere, Pakistan and Bangladesh have also seen heat waves in recent months, with temperatures soaring above 40°C (104°F) for many days during the spring and summer. Using coastal and river flooding data, as well as temperature readings, the team from Cornell and Schroders said it had projected how different scenarios would affect manufacturing workers. The team said its cost estimates of $65 billion by 2030 were based on a “business as usual” scenario amid high heat and flooding, if no measures are taken. If factory owners proactively take steps to help lower heat stress for workers, they may be able to avoid some of the projected lost earnings, according to the study. The first scenario includes the assumption that heat stress will cause considerable changes in worker productivity. For example, output may decline by about 1.5% for each 1°C increase in the “wet-bulb globe temperature,” a measure of heat stress, according to the report. The study’s authors have urged businesses and regulators to protect workers by treating extreme weather events as serious health hazards, with the provision of paid leave and the right to suspend work. Fashion brands should also consider helping suppliers relocate their facilities to nearby, lower-risk locations, they suggested. Anyone tempted to “cut and run” should think twice, according to the researchers. They said businesses looking to move suppliers out of these locations entirely would “struggle to build the large-scale capacity they benefit from in South and Southeast Asia.” “Climate ‘loss and damage’ for manufacturers and workers are treated by brands as externalities — someone else’s problem,” Jason Judd, executive director at Cornell’s Global Labor Institute, said in a statement. “Workers need these investments now because extreme heat standards and flood protections are non-existent.”"

It was the first of a slew of extreme weather events that have hit ten countries and territories in just 12 days – the most catastrophic being the floods in Libya, which have killed more than 11,000 people according to the UN and left many thousands missing. Scientists warn that these types of extreme weather events, affecting countries all over the world, may become increasingly common as the climate crisis accelerates, putting pressure on governments to prepare. “Global warming actually changes the properties of precipitation in terms of frequency, intensity and duration,” said Jung-Eun Chu, an atmospheric and climate scientist at the City University of Hong Kong – though she added that this summer’s devastation was due to a combination of different factors including natural climate fluctuations. The huge toll of the floods also highlights the urgent need for governments to prepare for this new reality, and the ways conflict-ridden and poorer countries sit on the front lines of climate disasters. Governments “have to be ready,” said Chu. “They have to start thinking about it, because they’ve never experienced these kinds of extreme events before.” This month, swaths of the Mediterranean region have been lashed by Storm Daniel, the result of a very strong low-pressure system that became a “medicane” – a relatively rare type of storm with similar characteristics to hurricanes and typhoons which can bring dangerous rainfall and flooding. The storm, which formed on September 5, affected Greece first, releasing more rain than is normally seen in an entire year. Streets turned into deadly rivers, submerging whole villages and forcing emergency workers on inflatable boats to rescue families from their flooded homes. At least 15 people died, according to the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who called it “one of the most powerful storms to ever hit Europe.” The floods, which followed devastating wildfires in the country, “have the fingerprints of climate change,” Greek environment minister Theodoros Skylakakis told CNN on Tuesday. “We have had the warmest summer on record. The sea was very warm, which lead to this unique meteorological event,” he said. Neighboring Turkey felt the impact too, recording at least seven deaths. Residents in wooded areas had to wade through knee-high water, surrounded by fallen trees – while parts of Istanbul, the country’s biggest city, saw deadly flash floods which killed at least two people. Severe flooding also struck Bulgaria, north of Greece, with at least four deaths confirmed. Elsewhere in Europe, a separate storm – Storm Dana – saw torrential rain across Spain, damaging homes and killing at least three people. By far the most devastating impact was felt in Libya, as Storm Daniel moved across the Mediterranean, gaining strength from the sea’s unusually warm waters, before dumping torrential rain on the northeast of the country. The catastrophic rainfall caused the collapse of two dams, unleashing a 7-meter (23-foot) wave, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The water rushed toward the coastal city of Derna, wiping out entire neighborhoods and sweeping homes into the ocean. More than 11,000 people are dead and at least another 10,000 still missing, according to the UN, with many believed to have been swept out to sea or buried beneath rubble. As the nation reels, and as search and rescue operations grow desperate, experts say the scale of the disaster has been greatly magnified by a combination of factors including crumbling infrastructure, inadequate warnings and the impacts of the accelerating climate crisis. “This is a tragedy in which climate and capacity has collided to cause this terrible, terrible tragedy,” said UN aid chief Martin Griffiths on Friday. Libya has been wracked by a civil war and a political standoff for almost a decade, with the nation split between two rival administrations since 2014 – one of which isn’t recognized by most of the international community, and which controls the region where Derna is located. The North African country’s fragmented state has made it unprepared for the flooding, experts say, and may hamper delivery of urgently needed humanitarian aid. “The situation in Libya has been steadily deteriorating due to years of conflict and instability, compounded by the impacts of climate change,” said Ciaran Donnelly, senior vice president for crisis response, recovery and development at the International Rescue Committee. “Globally, climate change has made these extreme weather events more frequent and intense, making it even harder for communities to cope and rebuild, especially in conflict-affected regions,” he added. While the scale of devastation and loss of human life was smaller in Asia, it has also reckoned with  deadly and unprecedented storms. Two typhoons – Saola and Haikui – passed through the region within days of each other during the first week of September, causing widespread damage in the self-governing island of Taiwan, the city Hong Kong and other parts of southern China including Shenzhen. Though Typhoon Saola shut down Hong Kong schools and businesses for two days, the real damage came a week later when the city was lashed by a sudden storm, with flash flooding submerging metro stations and trapping  ivers on roads. The storm brought the highest hourly rainfall since records began in 1884, according to Hong Kong authorities. In Taiwan, Typhoon Haikui left tens of thousands of homes without power, and more than 7,000 residents were evacuated. The dual typhoons were an “exceptional case” that created the conditions for an unusually severe storm the following week, said Chu. The typhoons brought two slow-moving air masses, both heavy with moisture and traveling in different directions – which collided and dumped that water over Hong Kong “If there were only one typhoon, it would not make this kind of severe precipitation,” she said. She added that while the event isn’t explicitly linked to climate change – the converging typhoons happened “by chance” – human-caused global warming is helping fuel stronger storms. “If the climate warms, if the (ocean) surface becomes warmer, the atmosphere can hold more moisture,” she said. “If temperatures increase by one degree (Celsius), the atmosphere can hold 7% more moisture.” She pointed to the history of hourly rainfall records in Hong Kong. In the past, there used to be decades between record-breaking rainfall events, Chu said, but gaps between records are narrowing rapidly. As our world warms, extreme weather that used to happen once in a lifetime are becoming more frequent occurrences. Parts of the Americas have been inundated too. Brazil recorded more than 30 deaths last week after heavy rains and floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul – the worst natural disaster to hit the state in 40 years, according to CNN’s regional affiliate CNN Brasil. Brazilian meteorologist Maria Clara Sassaki told CNN Brasil that within a week, the state had received the average amount of rainfall expected for the entire month of September. Meanwhile in the United States, the Burning Man festival made international headlines after a heavy rainstorm pummeled the area, with tens of thousands of attendees told to conserve food and water while stranded in the Nevada desert. The remote area was hit with up to 0.8 inches – about twice the average September rainfall – in just 24 hours. On the opposite side of the country, flooding in Massachusetts has damaged hundreds of homes, businesses and infrastructure including bridges, dams and railways. Rainfall in parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire has been more than 300% above normal volumes over the past two weeks, according to weather service data. Experts say record-warm ocean temperatures have fueled a hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season that shows no signs of slowing. More than 90% of warming around the globe over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It means more storms are able to form than would otherwise be possible in a typical El Niño year, Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, told CNN. Even storms that weaken due to changes in wind can stay alive and gain strength again once they find better conditions. CNN’s Taylor Ward, Sana Noor Haq, Celine Alkhaldi, Eyad Kourdi, Hamdi Alkhshali, Mostafa Salem, Kareem El Damanhoury, Nadeen Ebrahim, Laura Paddison, Chris Liakos, Christian Edwards, Louise McLoughlin, Brandon Miller, Elizabeth Wolfe and Mary Gilbert contributed reporting."

Instead, gasoline prices are getting more expensive and are just pennies away from their highest level so far this year. That’s because aggressive oil supply cuts in Saudi Arabia and Russia and deadly flooding in Libya have sent crude prices on a tear. Oil prices hit a 10-month high on Friday and are on pace to hit their largest quarterly increase since Russia first invaded Ukraine in the beginning of 2022. Increasing oil prices are a bad omen on Wall Street — they mean higher inflation and introduce the possibility of more economy-crushing interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. More pain at the pump also means less consumer spending elsewhere and a heightened possibility of recession. There’s already a lot to fret about this autumn: Auto workers are on strike, the federal government could face another shutdown, China’s economy is still distressingly subdued and geopolitical tensions are on the rise. Are rising oil prices another item to add to the list? David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management and self-declared worrywart, doesn’t think so. Before the Bell spoke with Kelly about why Americans don’t have to fear the pump, at least right now. This interview has been slightly edited for length and clarity. How high do you think oil prices will go? David Kelly: If there’s some other shock, some big storm in the Gulf of Mexico, it could spike higher. But as we look at this, we don’t think the trend over the next year or two is going to be higher oil prices. There are a few reasons for this. One thing we need to remember is that the price of everything has gone up, and all of the input costs of producing oil have increased. Sure we’re at $90 a barrel right now — but if you measure by today’s dollars, we actually peaked at something like $184 per barrel back in 2008. When you adjust for inflation, oil isn’t that high right now. Another thing is that the US has whittled away its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we’ve reduced that a lot. There was an inventory overhang we could use to try to balance the market, and it’s not as big as it was. Going forward, US production is growing very rapidly — we’re currently producing more crude oil than either Russia or Saudi Arabia. This is going to be a record year for US liquid fuel production, and next year is going to be even stronger. The global economy is growing slowly, and that’s going to limit demand growth for fossil fuel energy. And frankly, the green energy transition is also limiting the growth in demand. So when I look at the supply side I think the US and other non-OPEC members will help, and when I look at the demand side, I don’t see a lot of economic growth or demand for fossil fuels. So I don’t expect economic trends to push prices much higher, although of course some shock could. Why are oil prices so connected to recession? Expensive oil has a very nasty triple effect of pushing up inflation and sometimes forcing a tighter monetary policy at the very time that it’s squeezing the ability of consumers to spend elsewhere. You saw that most obviously in the 1970s … when high gasoline prices meant people had less money to spend on other stuff, and meanwhile, the Federal Reserve pushed rates up too high to fight inflation. That’s why oil caused a recession in 1974-1975 and caused double barreled recessions in 1980 and 1982. The Great Financial Crisis in 2008 was not about oil, but consumers were in a weakened position going into it because of all the money they were spending on gasoline. These are all reasons why Americans have come to fear a spike at the gas pump. What do elevated oil prices mean for inflation and future rate hikes by the Federal Reserve? I certainly hope the Federal Reserve doesn’t react by raising interest rates one more time. We don’t think they’re going to raise in September, and the futures market is saying there’s a 50/50 chance that they raise one more time in November. Economists and the rest of the world talk about inflation differently: Economists talk about inflation as being the rate of change in prices, and consumers think that you’ve got inflation when prices are high. So for inflation to go away you don’t need the price of gasoline to fall, you just need it to stop rising. I think that we are going to see continued high prices for a lot of stuff, including gasoline, but I don’t think we’re gonna see an acceleration in prices. We believe that inflation will be below the Fed’s 2% target by the fourth quarter of next year. The Fed measures inflation year-over-year, so the fact that we’re having a spike in gasoline prices right now makes it more likely that by next year price growth will be below 2%. We’ve been on this roller coaster, but the thing about a roller coaster is that you get off where you got on, no matter how bumpy the ride was. What should investors do in the meantime? People should continue to look for opportunities to invest in the energy transition. The bigger point isn’t the short term price of oil, it’s the fact that the people who are controlling it — the Saudis and Russians — aren’t particularly friendly to the United States right now. Even though we are a net exporter of oil, we’re still affected by their ability to influence the market in ways that don’t help us. I think this recent oil spike only confirms the fact that we need to invest in something other than fossil fuels. If the Federal Reserve does raise rates one more time, I think it does increase the risk of recession. So you want to make sure that you’re positioned a little bit more defensively because of the danger that higher gasoline prices tend to increase the risk of recession. When the United Auto Workers called a strike last week against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, one of their demands focused on an idea circulating on the periphery of labor reform circles. In addition to calling for a 36% pay raise and increased job security, union members want a 32-hour, four-day workweek with no pay cuts, reports my colleague Eva Rothenberg. Proposals to shorten the workweek have gained traction in recent years, with the flexibility of pandemic-era remote work fueling many of these calls. The accelerating use of artificial intelligence in the workplace has also pushed some workers to question the necessity of a 40-hour week. Sen. Bernie Sanders has long been a vocal proponent of a shortened workweek. “We are looking at an explosion in this country of artificial intelligence and robotics. And that means that the average worker is going to be much more productive,” the Vermont Independent told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday. “The question as a nation that we have to ask ourselves is: Who is going to benefit from this productivity? We should begin a serious discussion — and the UAW is doing that — about substantially lowering the workweek.” The pandemic dented sales of engagement rings as relationships faltered — or never even blossomed in the first place — as people stayed inside or avoided socializing outside of the immediate family says Signet Jewelers, the largest jewelry company in the United States. This trend then created an “engagement gap” since couples get engaged, on average, about 3.25 years after they begin dating, according to Signet’s proprietary data. But with the return of many pre-pandemic lifestyles, including dating, Signet (owner of Zales, Jared, Kay Jewelers, Blue Nile and Diamonds Direct) said the lull in proposals is expected to bottom out this year. That means engagements will likely rebound starting in early 2024, reports my colleague Parija Kavilanz. About 2.8 million couples, on average, get engaged every year in the United States, said Signet CEO Virginia Drosos during a company presentation at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference on Wednesday. Last year, the number slipped to 2.5 million. She said it will continue to head lower to level out at 2.1 to 2.2 million in 2023 before climbing back up and fully rebounding over the next three years. In 2024, Signet expects engagements will reach 2.4 to 2.5 million. That rebound is crucial to the company since bridal jewelry accounts for 50% of its overall merchandise sales."

They also found the extreme rainfall that hit Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria was made up to 10 times more likely. Destruction from the rainfall was worsened by a tangle of other factors, including inadequate infrastructure and building in flood-prone areas, according to the analysis published Tuesday. Extreme rainfall has swept across large parts of the Mediterranean region since the start of the month. On September 3, Spain saw huge amounts of rain over the course of just a few hours, leading to floods which killed at least six people. Then Storm Daniel formed, causing severe flooding over four days in Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria. At least 17 people died in Greece and large stretches of farmland in the central part of the country were left under water, causing damage experts say could take years to recover from. Storm Daniel also caused at least seven deaths in Turkey and four in Bulgaria. By far the most catastrophic impacts, however, were in Libya. Gaining energy from the unusually warm waters of the Mediterranean, Storm Daniel dumped record amounts of rainfall in parts of the country’s northeast, leading to the collapse of two dams and resulting in a 7-meter (23-foot) wave of water slamming into the city of Derna, sweeping people and buildings into the sea. Official estimates suggest around 4,000 people were killed, while more than 10,000 remain missing. To understand the impact of climate change on the likelihood and intensity of this heavy rainfall, WWA scientists analyzed climate data as well as climate models, which allow them to compare today’s climate – around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels – to a world without climate change. They found in Libya, not only did climate change make the extreme rainfall up to 50 times more likely, it also made it up to 50% more intense. An event as severe as the one the country experienced is unusual even in today’s warmer climate, the report found, and can be expected around once in every 600 years. For Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria, climate change made the rainfall up to 10 times more likely and up to 40% heavier, the analysis found. The kind of extreme rainfall this region experienced is likely to happen around once every 10 years, according to the report. Although for central Greece, which bore the brunt of the destruction between the three countries, it is only expected to happen around once in every 80 to 250 years. The WWA scientists acknowledged that there remain uncertainties with the findings. It is not possible to definitively rule out the possibility the climate crisis had no impact on the floods, the report authors said. But, they added, there are “multiple reasons we can be confident that climate change did make the events more likely.” Scientific research has long linked climate change to more intense rainfall. Studies have found that for every 1 degree Celsius of warming, the air can hold around 7% more moisture. What united many of the places the analysis focused on was the collision of the climate crisis and high levels of vulnerability, the report found. In central Greece, many communities live in flood-prone areas. In Libya, a lethal cocktail of aging, poorly-maintained infrastructure, a lack of warnings and deep political fractures turned a crisis into a humanitarian catastrophe. “Through these events we are already seeing how climate change and human factors can combine to create compounding and cascading impacts,” Maja Vahlberg, of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and a report author, said on a call with reporters. Steps can be taken to mitigate the risk, according to the report, including better early warning systems and evacuation plans. “Reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience to all types of extreme weather is paramount for saving lives,” Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, at Imperial College London, said in a statement. Karsten Haustein, a climate researcher at Leipzig University in Germany who was not involved in the study, said the findings show how rare these extreme rainfall events would have been in a world without climate change. It’s “a remarkable result,” he told CNN. Jasper Knight, a geoscientist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, also not involved in the study, said that the results shine a light on how climate change is affecting extreme events in the Mediterranean, a region which tends not to receive much attention. But, he told CNN, “we also need more in-depth analysis based on longer and more accurate records.”"

","Ella Nilsen and Krystina Shveda, CNN","Millions of American homeowners could see insurance rates surge in the coming years in part due to worsening climate disasters, new data shows. An analysis of from nonprofit research group First Street Foundation found nearly 39 million homes and commercial properties – about 27% of properties in the Lower 48 – are at risk of their premiums spiking as insurers struggle to cover the increasing cost of rebuilding after disasters. It’s another alarming sign for the future of America’s homeowners’ insurance market. In the last few years, major insurers have pulled out of or stopped writing new policies in California, Florida and Louisiana – in part citing increased climate risks like more destructive wildfires and stronger hurricanes. But while insurance prices have already surged in those states, First Street found it’s still growing in other places we think of as less risky. “This is not just isolated to particular areas of the country, but also will impact other areas that we traditionally might not think of,” said David Jones, the former California insurance commissioner and director of the Climate Risk Initiative at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, who was not involved in the analysis. The insurance industry is only just beginning to price the cost of climate change into its premiums, said Jeremy Porter, the head of climate implications at First Street and one of the report’s lead authors. “We’re still kind of at the forefront of the insurance industry pricing in climate risk into the real estate market,” Porter told CNN. “The insurance companies are going to continue to respond to the increasing climate damages.” For homeowners, this also means fewer choices between companies as private insurers pull out of high-risk areas or restrict coverage. Nearly 7 million properties, almost 1 in 20 buildings, have already experienced price surges or have been dropped by insurance companies, First Street found. The majority of those properties are located either in wildfire and flood-prone California, or hurricane-prone Florida, Louisiana and Texas. But this problem is growing nationwide. Jones pointed to recent extreme flooding that inundated Vermont this summer – dumping up to 9 inches in some parts of the state over two days and submerging the state’s capital of Montpelier. Kentucky and West Virginia have been struck with deadly and costly flooding from massive rainstorms that combined with steep terrain to overwhelm small streams and creeks. “It’s hard to identify a part of the country that that’s not impacted or won’t be impacted,” Jones told CNN. “And it’s only going to get worse.” Every property in more than 1 in 10 American cities is at risk of premium spikes because of climate disasters, according to an analysis of the First Street data. These include places in states where insurers have already started to pull out, including Miami, Jacksonville and New Orleans. Outside of California, Florida and Louisiana, there are also cities where all properties are vulnerable to sudden price adjustments, mainly along the East Coast where hurricane risk is high and sea level is rising, the data shows – including Atlantic City, New Jersey; Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Virginia; Wilmington, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; and Savannah, Georgia. Premiums are at risk of surging to a lesser extent in cities across the country, First Street data shows. Properties in 4 out of 5 cities in the Lower 48 are vulnerable to rate hikes, including more than 25% of properties in New York City and Phoenix. In the Midwest, up to a fifth of homes in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Louisville and Cincinnati – susceptible to flooding rain and strong winds – are also at risk of premium adjustments. And on the West Coast, nearly all of Riverside, California, and a fifth of Los Angeles could see premiums spike. Even if these homes are not yet on the state-run insurer of last-resort – to which they typically pay higher premiums for a policy that covers less, “they have the same risk profile,” Porter said. While this dynamic is just starting in the private insurance market, the price shocks already came for homeowners in the federal government’s flood insurance program. Premiums on federal flood insurance – known as the National Flood Insurance Program – increased significantly starting in 2021 as the federal government adjusted for the cost of stronger storms. The most flood-prone areas of Gulf Coast states are set to get hit with rate increases especially hard as the plan is implemented over the next several years; in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, FEMA data shows its insurance premiums would go up 545% — from $842 to $5,431 per year. In Collier County, Florida – which was struck by Hurricane Ian last year – the increase was expected to be from around $1,050 per year to nearly $4,000. The math isn’t working for some homeowners who have seen their premiums skyrocket. “When you see this huge spike – doubling, tripling, quadrupling of your insurance rate – all of a sudden those finances don’t make sense to regular people,” he said. Faced with higher premiums, some homeowners who don’t carry a mortgage are choosing to forgo insurance altogether – leaving them unprotected if a disaster hits, said Amy Bach, the executive director at United Policyholders, an insurance consumer-advocacy group. It’s hard to know exactly how many homeowners are choosing to “go bare” without insurance, Bach said, because she believes many aren’t willing to self-report their choice. But her work with homeowners gives her a window into peoples’ decisions. “I know where the places are where people are dropping their insurance — it’s Florida, Louisiana, California and Colorado,” Bach told CNN. “And soon there’s going to be other places, because this is a national virus.” Jones and Porter said there are larger economic implications down the road, when homeowners who have taken a higher premium try to sell their house and find they are short of buyers. Jones said in parts of California that are prone to wildfires, there is already evidence that the lack of affordable insurance is impacting home prices. “It stands to reason that if you’re a homebuyer, you’re going to ask the question, what’s it going to cost me to insure this place, and can I get insurance?” Jones said. If the answer is insurance is really expensive and hard to get, “then homebuyers are saying, ‘I’m not going to pay as much for this house, because it’s simply not worth as much.’”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/20/business/winter-heating-costs-oil-natural-gas/index.html,Winter expected to be costlier for those who heat with oil. But natural gas heat users will finally get a break.,09-21-2023,"                                                 After several years of skyrocketing winter heating costs, millions of Americans are expected to finally get a little relief this coming season — if they heat their homes with natural gas, that is.                                             ","Tami Luhby, CNN","After several years of skyrocketing winter heating costs, millions of Americans are expected to finally get a little relief this coming season — if they heat their homes with natural gas, that is. Natural gas heating, which is used by just under half of US homes, is expected to cost an average of $726 this winter, down 7.8% from last year, according to an estimate released Wednesday from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. But those using home heating oil will likely get walloped once again. The cost is expected to jump to an average of $2,275, up 8.7% from last year, as oil prices rise due in part to recent decisions by Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut back on petroleum production. Only 4.1% of households use home heating oil, mainly in the Northeast. “This is the first year many families will get a break,” said Mark Wolfe, the association’s executive director, referring to the projected drop in natural gas heating costs. However, “if you are up in New England, this is scary. It’s going to be another expensive year for families using heating oil.” Heating with propane is expected to cost an average of $1,538, up 4.2% from last season. Electricity, which is the second most common source of heat, is projected to cost an average of $1,374, up 1.2%. The federal Energy Information Administration is expected to release its winter heating cost outlook next month. Americans are gearing up for the winter heating season just as rising gas prices have strained their finances. Even with the projected drop in natural gas heating costs, families are still shelling out far more than they were in the winter of 2020-2021, when it only cost them $573, on average, for the season, according to the association. Those using heating oil have seen their costs explode since that winter, when they paid only $1,212, on average. Heating with propane and electricity cost $1,162 and $1,180, on average, respectively, in the winter of 2020-2021. “For the foreseeable future, home energy is going to be expensive,” Wolfe said. “We are not seeing the prices we saw three or four years ago.” What’s more, Congress is not expected to continue providing the significant funding boosts for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that it has in recent years, Wolfe said. Both the House and Senate, which have yet to agree to funding the federal government for the coming fiscal year, have proposed allocating about $4 billion for the safety net program. But lawmakers had provided $6 billion this year and about $8.4 billion in the prior fiscal year to help Americans contend with rising energy prices. The reduction could mean that 1 million fewer families will be served, said Wolfe, who is concerned the allocation could be slashed even further. And it would come at a time when applications for LIHEAP assistance have risen for both heating and cooling assistance. “Part of the problem is that we are under pressure to run year-round programs because of summer, and there’s not enough money,” Wolfe said. If the federal LIHEAP budget is reduced, the Alliance for Community Empowerment — which distributes assistance to Connecticut residents — may be forced to turn away people in need, said Monette Ferguson, the nonprofit’s executive director. “The budget being cut not only will leave our clients having to make hard sacrifices, but it also can lead to children being without heat,” said Ferguson. “Utility costs have doubled, and clients should not have to choose if they are going to provide heat or food for their families.”"

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action. Every parent worries about when, and how, to have a conversation with their children about the birds and the bees. Are they old enough? How much detail should I give? Will they understand? What do they know already? The reality is that the information is already out there. It’s in the news and it’s being discussed in schools. It’s across social media. It’s written into plot lines in books and shows. And it’s not just adults discussing it – so are kids. And by the birds and the bees, I’m referring to climate change and its effect on plants and animals and people around the world. We need to address it head on. As much as you’d like to be able to tell your children climate change isn’t something they need to be concerned about, you know you can’t. It’s here. We are all seeing it, many of us are dealing with its impact already and it’s going to get worse. How much worse depends on how quickly we can reduce adding greenhouse gases to the air. Just like other grown-up issues your children need to face, it’s best if they learn about climate change from you, as well as their science teachers, climate scientists and other reliable sources who can give them accurate information (rather than the kid down the block). Ask them what they’ve heard about climate change and if they have any questions or concerns. Answer them openly and honestly. Start with the basics. Explain why our planet is heating up and changing our weather patterns. Educate yourself first using reliable online resources, such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA, both US government agencies. Or research together with your children. My website, “Kids Against Climate Change,” has child-friendly articles and videos for all age groups. Discuss what you’ve seen and read, both the facts and your feelings. If your children express anxiety over climate change, acknowledge their concerns. Make sure they have the correct facts; then assure them that there are grown-ups taking steps to slow down climate change. Project Drawdown highlights many effective actions being taken to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as replacing gas burning stoves, ovens, furnaces and boilers with those that run on electricity. Look at the website together and discuss your favorite ideas. But you’ll have to acknowledge that it’s not enough. Everyone needs to be mindful to live more sustainably; that is, to live in a way that Earth’s natural resources (trees, clean water and even clean air) are not depleted. The first place to start is to reduce waste: electricity, water, food. Turn off lights when not needed. Use less air conditioning and heat. Use less water. Take only the food you’ll eat. Explain that not only will this help the planet, it will save money in the family piggy bank. Remember that actions speak louder than words, so the more your family can do to use less the better. Make a list of climate actions and post it on the fridge, such as turning off the water while brushing teeth, recycling, composting food scraps, unplugging chargers when not in use. Check them off when family members do them. I’ll bet your children would love to decorate the chart, perhaps with a colorful environmental theme. And if you want to be super cool parents, and give your children bragging rights at school, put solar panels on your house or buy an electric car. As a family, be on the look-out for evidence of ways people are beginning to reduce their carbon footprint. Talk about what you see each day as you move through your community (electric cars and buses, new trees planted, shoppers using re-usable bags). Have a competitive family? Keep a tally sheet – one point for each person who spots evidence of environment-friendly action. Spend time in nature with your children, be it in your back garden or local park, a forest or the seaside. Enjoy the sights, sounds, smells and textures of the natural world. Your joy, and the sense of discovery you feel exploring it with your children, will encourage them to fall in love with the beauty and wonders of the natural environment and will make them want to take care of it. There are many young people inspiring others to ramp up environmental stewardship. But kids don’t need to start a movement to do good. All they need to do is talk. Encourage them to speak up for sustainable living, and to remind everyone they know to reduce their waste and take action to reduce their share of environmental pollutants. However, once again, you need to be honest and acknowledge that doing all of this is still not enough. Reducing environmental impact is also the responsibility of oil companies, technology and utility companies, the transportation sector, manufacturers, governments, investors and philanthropists and organizations such as the United Nations. Everyone needs to take steps to slow down climate change. But these groups won’t take action without pressure from consumers and citizens. This is where your children really need your help, because as an adult you have more power. Help pressure these groups to take responsibility for cleaning the environment and mitigating climate change, and tell your children what you are doing. Don’t be surprised if they give you a pat on the back and say, “Job well done!” After all, it’s going to affect their future. The best way to talk to your children about climate change is openly and honestly, and to give them hope by taking action together. The next step is to encourage everyone you know who has children they love to do the same. And don’t forget to talk about the birds and the bees, and ways we can help all animals that are being impacted by climate change as well."

","Ella Nilsen and Donald Judd, CNN","President Joe Biden’s administration is launching the first-ever American Climate Corps Wednesday, the White House said, a workforce training and service initiative aimed at preparing American youth for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience. “The American Climate Corps, just in its first year of recruitment, will put to work a new diverse generation of more than 20,000 Americans doing the important task of conserving and restoring our lands and waters, bolstering community resilience, deploying clean energy – in many cases, distributed and community based – implementing energy efficiency technologies that will cut consumer costs for the American people, and advancing environmental justice so long overdue in so many places,” White House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi told reporters on a call previewing the announcement Tuesday. The new corps will support a wide range of jobs, including restoring coastal wetlands, forest management to help fight wildfires, and building out clean energy projects. Creating a Civilian Climate Corps has long been an ask of youth climate groups, including the Sunrise Movement. The corps was an idea first introduced as part of “unity” campaign task forces between Biden’s 2020 campaign and representatives of former Democratic presidential contender and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – task forces that had a big hand in crafting policy Biden ultimately implemented as president. Sunrise co-founder Varshini Prakash and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, were members of the climate task force, as well as Biden’s first White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy and current US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry. “A lot of the impetus and inspiration came from early proposals Sunrise shared on the Bernie/Biden task force,” Prakash told CNN in an interview Tuesday. But the road to making the corps a reality was long and fraught. Initially proposed as part of Biden’s Build Back Better agenda and bill, the program was stripped out of the Inflation Reduction Act, crafted by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Prakash told CNN the idea then moved to the White House to be implemented. RELATED: Biden’s climate law has led to 86,000 new jobs and $132 billion in investment, new report says Prakash said the new corps is an important part of Biden’s reelection argument to young people, but added much more needs to be done to cut fossil fuel use and combat the impacts of the climate crisis. “I think this represents a significant step forward,” Prakash said. “Young people need to see actions like this and more of it in the leadup to the 2024 election. There’s more to be done on the climate crisis.” Five states – California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan and Washington – have already launched successful Climate Corps programs, with an additional five – Arizona, Utah, Minnesota, North Carolina and Maryland – announcing their own state programs Wednesday, Zaidi said. Six agencies – the Department of Labor, Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Energy and AmeriCorps – will sign a memorandum of understanding establishing the new program, with AmeriCorps standing up a new “American Climate Corps hub” to support the initiative, building on investments from the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act aimed at climate resilience and conservation, an official told reporters Tuesday. Signups for the new program launch Wednesday at whitehouse.gov/climatecorps, while the recruitment cycle will follow over the coming year, the official added."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","The Biden administration on Wednesday announced new competitive grants totaling $4.6 billion that states, cities and tribes can apply for to reduce the planet-warming pollution that is fueling the climate crisis. The Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, which will be managed through the Environmental Protection Agency, is a second and larger tranche of funding in a $5 billion program that was part of the Inflation Reduction Act. The first went to help states and cities develop climate action plans. Some states, including Georgia, used those funds to develop their first-ever climate plan. In the initiative announced Wednesday, states, cities and tribes will have a lot of flexibility in how they design projects and apply for funding, though they need to demonstrate a proposed project reduces planet-warming pollution and boosts job creation and health benefits to low-income and disadvantaged communities. White House senior adviser John Podesta said the grants give states and cities a “unique opportunity to think big and to think creatively about how they want to act on climate.” “The program is intentionally broad in scope to give states tribes territories and cities, the flexibility they need to design their clean energy future,” Podesta told reporters on a media call, adding applicants could put the money towards making school buildings greener, establishing new clean energy projects, or updating building energy codes. Four states – Florida, Iowa, Kentucky and South Dakota – turned down the initial EPA planning grants for the funding, which restricts them from applying for the larger batch of money. However, EPA administrator Michael Regan said cities within those states can and have applied for the funding themselves. “Big metropolitan areas like Fort Lauderdale and Miami – they are in the game, they are preparing to participate in this opportunity, whereas the state of Florida decided that it would not,” Regan said on the media call, adding some states that declined funding “emphasized to us” that they thought cities would be better positioned to apply to the funding. The EPA noted in a press release it anticipates awarding anywhere from 30 to 115 grants ranging between $2 million and $500 million under the general competition, as well as approximately 25 to 100 grants ranging between $1 million and $25 million under the Tribes and territories competition. Grants will be awarded starting fall of next year; the deadline to apply is spring 2024. The program was announced the same day the Biden administration unveiled its plan to establish an American Climate Corps, a workforce training and service initiative aimed at preparing American youth for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience. At the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, President Joe Biden gave a speech that emphasized his administration’s efforts on the climate crisis. While he called for more investment from the private sector, he hailed the administration’s own clean energy investments and the climate financing it has secured for developing countries."

Ron DeSantis on Wednesday shared a vision for America’s energy sector, leading with a pledge to unravel President Joe Biden’s ongoing efforts to fight climate change while dismissing threats from intensifying weather events as “fear tactics.”                                             ","Steve Contorno, Kit Maher and Jessica Dean, CNN","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday shared a vision for America’s energy sector, leading with a pledge to unravel President Joe Biden’s ongoing efforts to fight climate change while dismissing threats from intensifying weather events as “fear tactics.” Speaking in Midland, Texas, the Republican presidential hopeful said people were “safer than ever from climate disasters,” arguing that Democrats and Biden were pushing an “ideological agenda.” “We’ve seen a concerted effort to ramp up the fear when it comes to things like global warming and climate change,” DeSantis said. In response to a question from CNN about concerns people have over recent instances of flooding and wildfire smoke, the governor acknowledged that climate disasters were “problematic” but said that the federal reaction to such threats needs to be “a little more realistic.” His comments come as communities across the globe are facing intensifying natural disasters, from wildfires across Canada to historic deadly flooding in Libya. DeSantis leads a state as vulnerable to climate change as any in the country. As governor, he has taken steps to harden Florida’s coastline against rising sea levels. Yet his comments Wednesday were among the most forceful to date in rejecting the scientific consensus surrounding man-made global warming. “We deal with hurricanes in Florida,” he said. “We deal with fires too in Florida, but what I would say is when … Joe Biden says that he’s more worried, like in 10 years, with the climate than a nuclear war, I mean, I’m sorry, that’s just not true.” Flanked by two oil rigs in West Texas, DeSantis vowed to withdraw the United States from global climate change pacts and end all commitments for the country to cut net greenhouse emissions to zero, while greenlighting more pipelines and allow mining and extraction of oil, gas, coal, uranium and other minerals on federal lands. DeSantis’ energy proposal also includes a pledge to bring gas prices down to $2 by 2025, a lofty goal that would be tested by international complexities that typically drive oil prices. Average gas prices have consistently stayed above $2 dating back to President George W. Bush’s second term, though it has dipped below that mark for brief periods under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Gas prices have fluctuated consistently under Biden, at times reaching record highs and driving troubling inflation. Biden has tapped into the country’s strategic petroleum reserves to help alleviate prices at the pump. The reserve held 350.6 million barrels of oil, as of the week ending September 8, down nearly 300 million barrels since he took office. DeSantis’ plan calls for refilling the reserves and limiting future use to emergencies. Located in the heart of the Permian Basin, Midland is so intertwined with its oil- and natural gas-rich economy that its motto is “Feel the Energy!” Following the event, DeSantis will stay in Texas for fundraisers in Midland, Houston and Dallas, according to a senior campaign official. According to his plan, DeSantis would roll back subsidies for electric vehicles and “support Americans’ right to drive the cars they want.” The Biden administration earlier this year proposed new car pollution rules that could lead to electric vehicles accounting for two-thirds of new car sales by 2032. Much of Biden’s push toward electric vehicles has come through the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package, the largest climate investment in US history. DeSantis said Wednesday he would seek to eliminate the Department of Energy and would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, a move first initiated under Trump but then reversed by Biden. DeSantis would also nix the Global Methane Pledge, a joint goal for reducing methane emissions reached last November by the Biden administration and the European Union. And DeSantis would federalize a priority of his in Florida: banning government pension funds from considering factors like environmental, social and governance when making investment decisions. While DeSantis on the campaign trail has often pushed for more fossil fuel production across the country, in Florida, he has fought to put guardrails on energy companies to protect his state’s environment. DeSantis on his second day as governor in 2019 signed an executive order that directed the state’s Department of Environmental Protection to “oppose all off-shore oil and gas activities off every coast in Florida and hydraulic fracturing in Florida.” He threatened he would “be raising Cain” if then-President Trump opened Florida’s coastal waters to drilling, warning that an oil spill there would have a “cascading effect” on his state’s economy. In 2020, his administration purchased 20,000 acres of Everglades wetlands to permanently protect them from oil drilling. “I will continue to fight every day for the Everglades and Florida’s environment,” he said at the time. DeSantis, though, has since seemed to distance himself from his environmental streak, telling reporters that “people have kind of misconstrued” what he has done in Florida and attributing his anti-drilling position to Floridians who enshrined such protections in the state constitution. “Florida has a constitutional amendment to not have oil and gas exploration offshore,” he told CNN on Wednesday. “The view in Florida is definitely more mixed on that than it would be in, like, Louisiana or Texas. But that doesn’t mean that other states, you know, shouldn’t do it. It’s really up to them what they want to do.” DeSantis has also faced questions from voters in Iowa – the first nominating state on the GOP calendar – about his energy record, particularly his past opposition to ethanol subsidies. As a congressman in 2017, DeSantis co-sponsored a bill to eliminate the federal renewable fuel standard, which mandates the blending of biofuels – most often corn-based ethanol – into US transportation fuel. Iowa is the country’s leading producer of corn, more than half of which is used to make ethanol for fuel. DeSantis recently wrote an op-ed in an Iowa newspaper that did not acknowledge his sponsorship of the 2017 bill but said that, as president, his administration would “also support giving drivers additional low-cost options at the pump, including higher ethanol blends such as E30 and higher octane options, and ensure that America’s fuel economy is driven by moms in Marion, not bureaucrats in Washington.” Trump has seized on DeSantis’ past efforts to end the renewable fuel standard as he seeks to drive a wedge between the Florida governor and Republican caucusgoers in Iowa. At the Iowa State Fair this summer, Trump’s campaign handed out flyers highlighting DeSantis’ past position on ethanol and claiming that the governor has been “fighting for years to kill every single job supported by this vital industry.” DeSantis campaign spokesman Bryan Griffin previously dismissed those attacks as “further evidence of (Trump’s) eroding support in Iowa.” “Iowans increasingly know that Governor DeSantis is the presidential candidate who shares their values,” Griffin said. But DeSantis has largely dodged questions from Iowans about ethanol, promising he would have more to say when he introduced his energy agenda. Ethanol, DeSantis said in August, “will be a part of our energy policy, because it’s American made energy that’s produced, that supports American jobs.” This story and headline have been updated with additional information."

He also announced that the ban on onshore wind will be lifted. It marks a sharp turn away from a long-standing political consensus on the climate, just two years after the United Kingdom hosted the crucial COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and seriously undermines efforts to portray Britain as a leader in the fight against the climate crisis. The move intensifies Sunak’s newfound and controversial electoral strategy: binning Britain’s bolder emissions-cutting policies and picking fights with climate activists, in a gamble that the confrontation will appeal to traditional Conservative voters. Sunak, who is scrambling to reverse dismal opinion polling ahead of an election anticipated next year, sought to present the rollbacks as a “more pragmatic, proportionate and realistic” way of reaching net zero – framing the reversals as a longer-term and overdue change to approaching climate policies. In an attack on his own Conservative predecessors as prime minister, Sunak said: “You don’t reach net zero simply by wishing it. Yet that’s precisely what previous governments have done, both Labour and Conservative.” “This idea that we’re watering down our targets is just wrong,” he said, adding, “If we continue down this path, we risk losing the consent of the British people.” He said he will “set out the next stage” of his environmental agenda in the coming weeks, ahead of COP28. Boris Johnson, whose premiership included the COP26 and embraced the net zero pledge, had earlier shot back in a rare public attack on his former chancellor-turned-political rival. “Business must have certainty about our net zero commitments,” Johnson said in a statement, calling on Sunak to give firms “confidence that government is still committed Net Zero and can see the way ahead.” “We cannot afford to falter now or in any way lose our ambition for this country,” Johnson said. Sunak attempted to stake an occasionally awkward middle ground in his Wednesday speech, insisting his plans will keep Britain on track to reach net zero by 2050, while presenting the previous plans as overbearing and unfair on British workers. “We’ve stumbled into a consensus about the future of our country that no one seems to be happy with,” Sunak said. “Too often, motivated by short-term thinking, politicians have taken the easy way out… I’ve made my decision: we are going to change.” It’s an argument that will do little to convince climate experts, many of whom have warned the UK was already missing its targets. The Climate Change Committee, the government’s independent adviser on climate change, published a report in June that criticized the UK’s net zero plans and said there was not enough urgency to reach the country’s goals. Britain is legally required to have reached net zero – meaning the country would remove from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as it emits – by 2050. But the delays in phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles and gas boilers will mean the products remain on Britain’s roads and homes well into the 2040s, potentially complicating any efforts by future governments to accelerate emissions-cutting plans. There was a dramatic political pushback on Wednesday too. Johnson’s comments led a chorus of concerns from within Sunak’s Conservative party at the plans, which were apparently hurriedly brought forward after Tuesday’s leaks to the media. Opposition lawmakers, businesses and climate groups joined the green wing of the party in attacking the shift. Alok Sharma, a Conservative politician who served as president of the pivotal COP26 conference, told the BBC before Sunak’s press conference on Wednesday that rowing back from the cross-party consensus on net zero would be “incredibly damaging for business confidence.” “Frankly, I really do not believe that it’s going to help any political party electorally which chooses to go down this path,” Sharma added. Chris Skidmore, the Conservative former energy minister, told the PA Media news agency the moves were “the greatest mistake of his premiership.” Wednesday’s announcement comes at the same time as the Climate Ambition Summit at the UN General Assembly summit in New York, which Sunak is not attending. On the sidelines of the UN summit, former US vice president Al Gore told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that he thought Sunak “has done the wrong thing.” “I have heard from many of my friends in the UK – including a lot of Conservative party members, by the way – who have used the phrase ‘utter disgust’ and some of the young people there feel as if their generation has been stabbed in the back. It’s really shocking to me, but again this is an issue for the UK to handle,” he continued. “From a global perspective, this is not what the world needs from the United Kingdom,” the climate campaigner added. Also at the UN, Romain Ioualalen, a representative for environmental advocacy group Oil Change International, told CNN in a press briefing that Sunak’s announcement is a sign of “how far the UK has fallen when it comes to climate leadership.” “At least from the point of view of civil society from around the world, we’re really profoundly concerned about what’s happening in the UK. And it’s a sign that science doesn’t seem to be listened to anymore with that government,” Ioualalen said. Sunak has leaned into an anti-green agenda since his party unexpectedly and narrowly won a by-election in the far western edge of London in July that was dominated by plans to extend London’s low-emissions zone, charging drivers of the most polluting vehicles a fee for every day they used their car in the area. The prime minister’s Conservative party is deeply unpopular with voters, with opinion polls projecting anything from a comfortable defeat to a historic wipeout at the next general election, which must be called by January 2025 at the latest. Amid that context, and with a struggling economy that leaves the government with little wiggle room for dramatic fiscal changes, Sunak has emphasized a range of cultural issues and trumpeted socially conservative policies in a push to appeal to the party’s rightwing base. But polls show that the climate crisis is increasingly high on the list of British voters’ concerns, and the opposition Labour party has sought to attack Sunak on what they describe as a withdrawal from Britain’s former position as a global leader. “Rolling back on key climate commitments as the world is being battered by extreme flooding and wildfires would be morally indefensible,” Friends of the Earth’s head of policy, Mike Childs, said in a statement. British businesses also criticized Sunak’s plans on Wednesday. Lisa Brankin, the chair of Ford UK, said in a statement that the automobile giant “needs three things from the UK Government: ambition, commitment and consistency. A relaxation of 2030 would undermine all three.” And Ed Matthew, Campaigns Director for independent climate change think tank E3G, said the moves would drive up household bills and “damage the UK’s ability to compete with other countries on clean technology.” “Just as the United States, China and the European Union are racing ahead on green growth, Rishi Sunak appears ready to surrender,” he said. “The economic damage to the UK could be catastrophic.” CNN’s Luke McGee, Laura Paddison and Alex Hardie contributed reporting"

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","A storm set to form off the Southeast coast late this week will bring gusty winds, heavy rain and hazardous seas from Florida to New England as it tracks northward into the weekend. The area of low pressure, dubbed Potential Tropical Cyclone 16 by the National Hurricane Center, currently has 35 mph winds off the east coast of Florida. It’s expected to strengthen into a tropical storm by Friday as it approaches the North Carolina coast, the National Hurricane Center said. Depending on when it is named, it could be called Ophelia or Philippe. The next two Atlantic storm names are Ophelia and Philippe. There is a 40 percent chance this area of low pressure organizes into a subtropical storm into the weekend, according to the hurricane center. A subtropical storm is a cyclone that is not fully tropical, but still has some characteristics found in a tropical storm. But the difference in overall impacts between the two are minimal, as subtropical storms still produce strong winds and can spread heavy rain well away from the storm’s center. The storm’s impacts to a wide swath of the Eastern Seaboard will also be the same, regardless of whether  it is named. Rain and thunderstorms are likely to soak parts of Florida’s northeast coast late Wednesday night and Thursday as the storm slowly comes together. Breezy conditions will also develop on Thursday and churn up surf along the Florida and Georgia coast. As the coastal storm becomes more organized on Friday, rainfall will shift north and eastward into parts of the Carolinas and Virginia. The greatest risk for heavy rain is expected in eastern North Carolina, where the National Weather Service in Morehead City warned that rainfall from Friday through weekend could be substantial, with widespread totals of 4 to 6 inches likely in the far eastern portion of the state. Prolonged, heavy rain could cause flooding, especially in low-lying or poor drainage areas. Wind speeds will also increase on Friday, gusting 30 to 40 mph in coastal areas from the Carolinas north to Delaware. These wind gusts, coupled with soaked ground, may bring down trees, which could cause property damage and power outages. Rain from the coastal storm will stretch hundreds of miles from its center and drench portions of the mid-Atlantic during the day Saturday and even parts of New England by Saturday night. The heaviest rainfall will continue to remain largely confined to areas close to the coast, but inland areas will still have to deal with stormy weather which could disrupt outdoor plans. As the storm treks north, the risk for dangerous rip currents will be elevated along much of the East Coast as it churns up hazardous seas."

Distraught farmers watching crops carried away by floods. Sweltering temperatures spawning disease,” he said in a speech to open the Climate Ambition Summit, happening alongside the UN General Assembly in New York. “Climate action is dwarfed by the scale of the challenge,” he added, warning that if nothing changes we are heading “towards a dangerous and unstable world.” The one-day conference – which comes as the the world grapples with devastating floods and fires – is intended to build global momentum toward slashing planet-heating pollution ahead of the UN’s COP28 climate summit in Dubai in December. Wednesday’s summit is unusual due to Guterres’ decision to restrict the speaker list to countries he deemed to have clear and effective climate plans, and those prepared to send a high-level leader to speak. Of the nearly 200 countries present in New York for the General Assembly, only 34 nations and seven non-governmental bodies secured speaking slots at the UN chief’s summit. Notably absent from the speaker list were some of the world’s biggest polluters, including China, India and the United States, though US climate envoy John Kerry is attending. Also missing from the list was UK prime minister Rishi Sunak, who is facing a backlash at home over plans to weaken the country’s climate commitments. The aim of the summit is to increase ambitions on climate action, Guterres said. Selwin Hart, a special adviser to the UN Secretary-General on climate action and just transition, said there has been “massive backsliding” on commitments. “The countries that committed to net-zero by 2050, and to the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Agreement, they’re expanding fossil fuel licensing at a time when science tells us this is totally incompatible with this 1.5-degree goal,” he told CNN in a Tuesday interview. In his Wednesday speech,Guterres called on developed countries to reach net-zero emissions – removing from the atmosphere at least as much planet-warming pollution as they produce –  by 2040, at least ten years earlier than most current commitments. He also asked countries to commit to timelines to phase out fossil fuel emissions, as well as to significantly increase finance to help low- and middle-income countries quickly move to clean energy and invest in climate resilience measures to better cope with increasingly severe extreme weather events. “We are decades behind,” Guterres said. “We must make up time lost to foot-dragging, arm-twisting and the naked greed of entrenched interests raking in billions from fossil fuels.”"

Sobel, a professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, is an atmospheric scientist who studies extreme events and the risks they pose to human society.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. There have been so many floods, in so many parts of the world, in such a short period of time. In the past few weeks alone, there have been major flood events in Massachusetts, Hong Kong, Greece and  Spain. The greatest catastrophe was in Libya, where heavy rains associated with storm Daniel in the Mediterranean caused dam failures and led to a death toll that is at least several thousand, and could exceed 10,000 once the missing are accounted for, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. What is causing so many extreme floods at once? Is this climate change, or just a particularly severe bunch of weather flukes happening in close succession due to the climate’s own natural variability? As is typically the case, it’s probably some of both. And while we can say some things with confidence about the role of global warming in these kinds of events, there’s plenty more we can’t say. But those uncertainties don’t reduce the risks, and shouldn’t make us less committed either to the clean energy transition or climate adaptation. In fact, they should make us more committed. This is what we know: Overall, extreme rain events are becoming both more frequent and more extreme across much of the planet, and this is an expected and predicted consequence of global warming. There’s more water vapor in warmer atmospheres; we understand well why this should be the case, and we observe that it is the case. The heaviest rain events are the ones that are the most efficient at condensing that water vapor out into rain, and if there’s more water vapor to be condensed, the rains get heavier. This is a simple physical argument, but our very sophisticated computer models for predicting weather and climate also support it. The details of individual storms are more complex, though. A particularly rare event like Daniel in Libya has to involve other factors besides water vapor. In particular, the flooding in Greece, Spain and Libya all occurred in the presence of a weather pattern called “blocking,” where the upper atmospheric flow is distorted by a persistent high pressure system. This can cause major storms to occur in places where they’d otherwise be rare. Blocking happens naturally. But climate change acts by loading the dice on many types of weather events. So, is it possible that blocking, and the unusual storms that can accompany it, could be happening more often with warming? It is. But here, the science is on less solid ground. It has indeed been argued that warming causes blocking to become more prevalent. The evidence for this is mixed at best though, and many scientists with expertise in this problem are not convinced. I am one of the unconvinced, but I am keeping an open mind. While we know a lot about how warming affects extreme weather, there’s a lot we don’t know, too, and the effects of global warming on blocking is one area of ongoing research and debate. El Niño may also have been a factor in these recent floods. El Niños are short-term climate phenomena in which the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean surface becomes unusually warm, which temporarily alters the atmospheric circulation all over the planet. A recent study linked “East Pacific El Niños” with increased blocking over Europe in particular. Like blocking, El Niños occur naturally. Our climate models predict, however, that greenhouse warming will cause the Pacific to trend more towards an El Niño-like state as it warms. If the models were right, this would imply another way in which human influence could share some of the blame for the current El Niño, thus also the blocking event, and thus the floods. But the last half century or more of observations suggest that the models may be wrong: The Pacific has been trending more towards the opposite, a La Niña-like state, in which the eastern equatorial Pacific becomes unusually cool instead of warm, and the atmospheric circulation shifts in near-opposite ways to what happens in an El Niño. But there are multiple interpretations of the disagreement, and this, too, is a very live scientific debate. Since El Niños and La Niñas cause opposite effects in many places, this uncertainty about which will become more prevalent in the future throws a wrench into our ability to predict many specific aspects of climate change, such as its effect on hurricanes. Because of all these complexities, it can be difficult or even impossible to reach a conclusion about the role of climate change in some extreme weather events, including Daniel. That shouldn’t be comforting; climate change could be playing a larger role than we expect in many of these events. From a global risk management perspective, these kinds of catastrophes should make us more motivated to stop burning fossil fuels. At the same time, we have to do our best to adapt to the climate that’s here now. Among other things, this means maintaining basic infrastructure. It appears that the real catastrophe in Libya was due to the failure of the dams, an outcome that was probably preventable. Here in the US, we have a lot of old dams that are not in good shape. Even without climate change, it would behoove us to catch up on their maintenance, or, where these dams are no longer truly needed, remove them. What we know about climate change and extreme weather should strengthen that motivation; what we don’t know should strengthen it even more."

It’s expected to strengthen into a tropical storm by Friday as it approaches the North Carolina coast, the National Hurricane Center said. Depending on when it is named, it could be called Ophelia or Philippe. The tropical storm warning was issued from just south of Wilmington, North Carolina, to the Maryland-Delaware state line. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive in North Carolina as soon as Friday, before pushing into the mid-Atlantic on Saturday. A storm surge watch was also issued for parts of the same stretch of coastline, with up to 4 feet of surge possible from Surf City, North Carolina, to the Virginia Tidewater. The storm was slowly coming together on Thursday and causing rain and storms to bubble to life over parts of Florida’s northeast coast and far southeastern Georgia. Breezy conditions also ramped up and caused worsening seas, but the storm’s worst will come this weekend. Widespread rain As the coastal storm becomes more organized on Friday, rainfall will shift into parts of the Carolinas and Virginia. Rain will stretch hundreds of miles from its center as it treks north through the weekend and drench portions of the mid-Atlantic during the day Saturday and even parts of New England by Saturday night. The heaviest rainfall will remain largely confined to areas close to the coast, but inland areas will still have to deal with stormy weather, which could disrupt outdoor plans. The greatest risk for heavy rain and flooding is expected in far eastern North Carolina, with totals of 4 to 6 inches likely. Two to 4 inches of rain on Saturday through Sunday could impact a much larger swath of the eastern US from central North Carolina to New Jersey and New York. Even southern New England and inland areas, like Pennsylvania, could see 1 to 2 inches of rain this weekend. Strong winds Wind speeds will also increase on Friday for coastal areas, gusting 30 to 40 mph, with higher gusts possible closer to the center of the storm. The strongest winds are expected to arrive Friday for portions of the Carolinas and spread northward through the rest of the mid-Atlantic later Friday into Saturday. These wind gusts, coupled with soaked ground, may bring down trees, which could cause property damage and power outages. Coastal threats As the storm treks north, the risk for dangerous rip currents will be elevated along much of the East Coast as it churns up hazardous seas. The weather service warned of a high risk for rip currents headed into the weekend for sections of the coastline from Florida to New Jersey. Coastal flooding is also possible for portions of North Carolina northward into New Jersey as the storm moves up the coast this weekend.

","Cheri Mossburg, CNN","California will now let insurance companies consider climate change when offering policies, in exchange for a mandate requiring them to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas, state leaders announced on Thursday. “We are at a major crossroads on insurance after multiple years of wildfires and storms intensified by the threat of climate change,” California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. “The current system is not working for all Californians, and we must change course.” As a result of several companies choosing to drop coverage in the state recently, consumers without options are flocking to the state-subsidized Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan. “The FAIR plan has doubled to 3% of the market becoming the insurer of first resort for many Californians and not the last resort as it is intended to be,” Lara said Thursday at a news conference. “A growing FAIR plan is really a big problem for our state because the FAIR plan policyholders are required to pay more for less coverage and concentrating the highest risk properties under the FAIR plan increases the chance that they will be unable to afford a catastrophic disaster.” An executive order issued by California Gov. Gavin Newsom clears the way for the new regulations. Insurance companies will give priority to homeowners and businesses who have taken steps to harden their properties to disasters like wildfires, floods and windstorms. Lara said this is first-of-its-kind regulation. Once the new regulations are fully implemented, which is expected by December 2024, insurers will be required to have 85% of new policies they write cover property in areas prone to wildfires. Regulators believe that will help Californians to move off the FAIR plan. “We’re not going to get to affordability if we don’t tackle the availability issue,” Lara said. More available options for policies are expected to increase competition for better rates. “This is yet another example of how climate change is directly threatening our communities and livelihoods. It is critical that California’s insurance market works to protect homes and businesses in every corner of our state,” Newsom said in a statement."

","Kathleen Magramo and Chris Lau, CNN","Until recently, the upscale homes of the Redhill Peninsula seemed like an oasis for rich Hong Kongers aspiring to a tranquil lifestyle in an otherwise notoriously cramped metropolis of 7.5 million. Its cliffside location and unobstructed views of the South China Sea made for great Feng Shui and offered the perfect antidote to the hustle and bustle of city life for its gated community of tycoons, expats and celebrities. But that same pristine location worked against it on September 8, when a storm brought the heaviest rainfall in nearly 140 years to Hong Kong, wreaking havoc across the city. Two people were killed and more than a hundred injured as more than 600mm (23.6 inches) of rain barreled down on the coastal city, flooding metro stations and turning roads into rivers. The chaos was not confined to the flooded lowlands. Up on the edge of the cliff separating the Redhill Peninsula from the sea below it chipped away at the soil, leaving three millionaire homes perilously close to the edge and prompting an evacuation. In a city that had just experienced its hottest summer on record, the unprecedented rainfall – itself the product of the second typhoon to have hit the city in the space of a week – was a potent demonstration of the threat posed by climate change and its associated extreme weather. But for the residents of the Redhill Peninsula it was also a reminder that climate change is rewriting the rules of what can be considered “safe” construction, and that even the costliest, most well-constructed homes can be vulnerable. For some it may even be a reminder that such rules exist at all. City authorities say they are investigating whether building code violations in some of the houses contributed to the problem, in a development likely to fuel perceptions that the rich don’t play by the same rules as the poor. Whatever those investigations find, experts say extreme weather events like that of September 8 will become more frequent and when they do rich and poor alike will suffer the consequences – whichever rulebook they play by – even if the former have far more ability to bounce back from disasters than the latter. As Benny Chan, the president of Hong Kong Institute of Architects, points out, Hong Kong has long been prone to typhoons and torrential downpours and has “plenty of experience building these kinds of cliffside houses.” It also has stringent safety standards designed over many years with landslides in mind, he says. So it would have been reasonable – at least until a couple of weeks ago – to expect somewhere like the Redhill Peninsula to be a safe place to be in a storm. But the old rules, experts say, may no longer apply. That is likely to be an uncomfortable realization for anyone who has invested in the Redhill Peninsula – one of the most expensive neighborhoods in one of the world’s most expensive property markets. Properties here have the sort of appeal and cachet of the Malibu coast in Los Angeles. They have a distinctive Mediterranean style, with colors alternating in hues of cream and pink, and many have french windows overlooking the cove of Tai Tam, a scenic spot with a lush hiking trail nearby and ample shelter for luxury yachts to anchor below. They can go for between $10 million-$20 million for a 2,400-3,600 square foot home (and rent for up to $20,000 a month). Or at least, they could before the recent downpour. Local real estate agents say what effect the storm will have on property prices is a “sensitive” issue for some in the community. When CNN visited Redhill last week, sports cars and SUVs sporting the logos of Porsche, Land Rover and Ferrari were among the vehicles that cruised past the palm-tree-lined entrance, where a security guard stood like an impenetrable wall preventing the gaggle of assembled journalists from going in. The real pull of the district, according to a real estate agent with more than two decades of experience selling properties here, is its tight-knit community. “It has an international school and kids can hang out with one another at home after school,” said the agent, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. She was referring to the Hong Kong International School, one of the most prestigious in town. “Almost every house comes with a view of the sea,” she said, adding that while the development is far from the hustle and bustle of the city, it offers a convenient shuttle bus service to ferry residents around. The three houses most affected by the landslides were between 2,700 and 3,000 square feet in size, each valued at up to $11.5 million, the agent said. She added that she had noticed a change of mood in recent days and expects anyone trying to sell a property – especially one near to the sea – to lay low for a while. “It’s sensitive timing,” she said. Heavy rain is far from unusual in Hong Kong, especially during the summer months. Even so, recent weather patterns have been unsettling to many, with two consecutive typhoons sweeping across the region within a space of less than two weeks. Typhoon Saola, which barreled through Hong Kong on September 1, was the strongest to hit the city in five years. A week later, the remnants of Typhoon Haikui unleashed the rains that caused the problems at Redhill, dozens of landslides and left large swathes of the city underwater. Scientists say climate change will make such weather events only more frequent and some are urging Hong Kong to rethink its rain mitigation strategy. Leung Wing-mo, former assistant director of the city’s weather observatory, told public broadcaster RTHK that rainstorms are becoming harder to predict because of climate change. “In the past few decades, record-breaking events have been occurring much, much more frequently…This is a clear indication that climate change has a role to play. As a matter of fact, climate change is making extreme weather more extreme,” Leung said. With that in mind, architects and civil engineers are also calling for the city to review standards set decades ago for hillside buildings, including many luxury mansions. The city experienced some of its worst landslides in the 1970s, including one that knocked down a series of residential buildings in the city’s upscale Mid-Levels district, causing 67 deaths. The same powerful rain that caused the Mid-Levels landslide in 1972 also triggered a hill in a district of Hong Kong’s Kowloon Peninsula to collapse, decimating a squatter site in Sau Mai Ping causing a further 71 deaths. Structural engineering professor Ray Su, from the University of Hong Kong, said that the series of catastrophic incidents had prompted the government of the time to reinforce slopes across the city, turning Hong Kong into one of the most resilient places against landslides and floods in the world. But some engineers fear safety rules that seemed adequate in the past may no longer be enough. Su noted that some of the city’s low-rise houses were still built on shallow footings. In extreme rain scenarios, “they will take a big hit when landslides crumble down,” he said. Complicating matters in the case of the Redhill Peninsula is the suggestion by authorities that some of properties in danger may not even have been playing by the old rules. In the wake of the storm, government authorities detected what they suspect may be illegal alterations made to the three Redhill properties – alterations that experts say may have contributed to the disaster. That suggestion is something of a third rail issue in a city that has a track record of scandals involving wealthy individuals and politicians altering their properties and violating building codes with the sort of illegal extensions skeptics say the less well-off wouldn’t get away with. Hong Kong’s Buildings Department says among those unauthorized modifications are basements, a swimming pool, and a three-story extension. So controversial is the issue that even the city’s leader John Lee has stepped in, vowing that the government will investigate and prosecute anyone found to have violated building codes. “The landslide at Redhill Peninsula has already shown us that part of the estate carries risks, so relevant departments will target the estate for inspections,” he said last week. Preliminary investigations have shown a retaining wall was demolished in one of the houses. Chan, from the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, said the modification could destabilize the structure of the cliff below and greatly affect the drainage of the soil underneath, ultimately causing landslides. “The more the water is trapped, the less the slope can maintain a high steepness,” Chan said. He said while painful lessons in the past had given rise to high standards on building retaining walls and drainage systems, the old set of requirements is slowly losing relevance. “These standards were set a long time ago,” he said. “Can the present standards withstand that much rain? It is time for the government to look at them again,” he added. Chan Kim-ching, founder of Liber Research Community, a non-government organization that focuses on scrutinizing the authorities on land policies, said the safety problems that arose from illegal modifications went far further than the cases at Redhill. His group recently compared contracts available on public records and identified at least 173 individual houses across the city suspected of violations on public land. “We studied it in the past because it involves the fair use of public resources. Never did it strike us that it’s an issue that would threaten public safety,” he said. “It is like a ticking time bomb,” Chan said."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","It’s only early spring in Australia and the country is already grappling with heat and fire, sparking fears of a potentially devastating summer. Last weekend, more than 20 runners in the Sydney Marathon were hospitalized during a heat wave. Ski resorts, including Perisher, the country’s largest, have closed early amid a lack of snow after Australia’s warmest winter since records began in 1910. Then, last week, dozens of bushfires broke out in the country, with more than 60 burning in the densely-populated state of New South Wales. These are ominous signals for what large parts of the country can expect as spring rolls into summer. The confluence of natural climate phenomena, including El Niño, layered on top of human-caused global warming, is leading scientists to sound the alarm. “We are in a serious place,” said David Bowman, professor of pyrogeography and fire science at the University of Tasmania, Australia. “The climate change monster has woken up and El Niño means it is angry,” he told CNN. Last week, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) announced the official arrival of El Niño, a natural weather pattern originating in the Pacific Ocean that tends to bring hot and dry conditions to Australia, especially eastern parts. On top of El Niño, there’s another climate fluctuation in the mix that amps up the likelihood of heat and drought. The positive Indian Ocean Dipole is a climate pattern similar to El Niño, but originates in the Indian Ocean, and can have as large an influence on Australian weather. This “double punch” is “very unfortunate,” Bowman said. And the underlying trend of global heating, as the world continues to burn planet-warming fossil fuels, is further increasing the chances of extreme weather. “We are already seeing extreme weather conditions in some parts of the continent, particularly in the duration of heat,” as well as “catastrophic” fires, said Karl Braganza, head of climate monitoring at BOM, on a call with reporters Tuesday. He called on Australians “to prepare for a summer of heat and fire hazards.” Fears are particularly high as the memories of the 2019 to 2020 Black Summer fire season – the country’s worst in decades – remain etched in Australians’ minds. The fires burned 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres) to the ground, contributed to the deaths of hundreds of people and killed more than a billion animals. However, conditions are different this year. While the lead-up to the Black Summer fires was characterized by a 3-year period of drought – “whole, vast landscapes were primed to burn for months,” Bowman said – the last few years have been rainy in Australia due to the influence of El Niño’s cooler counterpart, La Niña. But experts told CNN there’s no space to be complacent. While a bushfire season as extensive as the Black Summer is unlikely, Robb Webb, CEO of the National Council for fire and emergency services (AFAC) told CNN, “we know that it doesn’t need to be ‘Black Summer’ to be a dangerous fire season.” AFAC’s fire outlook issued last month warned of an increased risk of fire across large parts of the country, as plants that grew during the rainier years are drying out fast. “Sustained heat waves can snap dry landscapes so all that lush vegetation can become tinder in days,” Bowman said. A combination of extreme heat and wind would likely fuel very intense fires “that will seem to come from nowhere,” he added. As well as fire, Australians can expect heat. “This summer will be hotter than average and certainly hotter than the last three years,” Braganza said. Temperatures are already breaking local records. On Wednesday, Sydney airport reached 35.9 degrees Celsius (97 Fahrenheit), according to BOM, breaking heat records for September. Sydney’s average September temperature is around 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit). Whether summer heat will be unprecedented remains uncertain. “Every El Niño is different,” said Andrea Taschetto, an associate professor in climate at the University of New South Wales, making it hard to predict exactly how hot things will get. But signs point to “a good chance for this summer to be the hottest on record,” she said. Others are more cautious. Jason Evans, also a climate professor at the University of New South Wales, said that while the abnormally hot winter “does raise concerns about extreme heat this summer,” he thinks the recent rainy years make record-breaking temperatures less likely. But everything depends on how dry the next few months are, he added. What is clear, he told CNN, is that climate change is making many extreme weather events more intense. “Increasing extreme heat is the clearest example,”he said, but it’s worsening the impacts of drought and extreme rain too. “Climate change is now taking center stage,” Bowman said. “The past is an increasingly unreliable guide for the future. Expect the unexpected.”"

Smith writes that with the American Climate Corps initiative we are expanding what is possible and living up to President Biden’s call “for a new era of national service.”                                             ,Opinion by Michael D. Smith,"Editor’s Note: Michael D. Smith is the Chief Executive Officer of AmeriCorps, the federal agency for national service and volunteerism. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion articles at CNN. “National service, I hope and pray, will help us to strengthen the cords that bind us together as a people.” Those were the words of President Bill Clinton 30 years ago this week when he signed the National and Community Service Trust Act, formally establishing AmeriCorps. Just a year later, 20,000 Americans took the AmeriCorps pledge to serve. This was the beginning of an unprecedented bipartisan movement of community-driven service and solutions. Over the course of 30 years, 1.25 million AmeriCorps members have joined the movement, serving and mentoring millions of students, supporting veterans re-entering the workforce, rebuilding homes after disasters, helping preserve endangered Native languages, and offering pathways for justice-impacted Americans – a second chance. A movement is exactly what it will take to address the greatest rising threat to humanity: a warming climate. President Joe Biden’s newly announced American Climate Corps — an interagency initiative between AmeriCorps, the Departments of Labor, Energy, Interior, Agriculture, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — will take this challenge head-on by training and preparing the American youth for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience. In 1933, the Civilian Conservation Corps (the “CCC”) began putting people to work, from addressing the ravages of the Dust Bowl, a catastrophic drought that devastated farmlands across the prairies, to collectively planting more than three billion trees. The CCC would restore the soil health of farmlands in the Heartland and power the Colorado River by constructing the Hoover Dam. Their work transformed the very landscape of America. Now, 90 years later, the American Climate Corps will focus not only on climate change, but climate justice. With equity at its core, unlike the CCC, the American Climate Corps will unite Americans in service, provide a pathway to good-paying union jobs and strengthen the economy for all. President Biden’s American Climate Corps marks a new era for youth-powered climate action in America – to reforest lands, preserve waterways, make urban, rural and tribal communities more climate resilient; and advance energy-efficiency projects. It’s a bold vision for America’s future – one that is necessary. None of us are immune from the impacts of the climate crisis. Just this past summer, we all experienced historic heat, wildfires, 101-degree ocean temperatures, record flooding and lengthy droughts. And while a changing climate threatens us all, we know it disproportionately harms communities of color the most. In Alaska, rising seas force Native communities to relocate away from their traditional homelands. In Rolling Fork, Mississippi, a tornado leveled a predominately Black community. More recently, wildfires devastated Maui, reducing entire neighborhoods to ash. Any strategy to address climate change without an equal emphasis on equity would turn a blind eye on those most closely impacted. That’s why President Biden called on the American Climate Corps to prioritize environmental justice. Members will represent the diversity of America — a rich mosaic of cultures, backgrounds and identities — because those who feel it most often hold the best solutions. Everyone deserves a seat — or shall I say, a hard hat — in the American Climate Corps. One of the first major partnerships under President Biden’s American Climate Corps is between AmeriCorps and the US Forest Service, establishing the new AmeriCorps NCCC Forest Corps. This five-year, $15 million agreement will deploy AmeriCorps members across the country to conserve national forests and grasslands, mitigate and respond to wildfires and reforest carbon-rich landscapes. This partnership highlights the importance of collaboration across agencies and is a small example of what we can — and will –— take to scale with the American Climate Corps. AmeriCorps has already been doing this work for years, funding organizations with innovative solutions. We engage 15,000 Americans annually, working to stem the disastrous effects of rising temperatures and extreme weather. For example, Conservation Legacy, an AmeriCorps grantee, recruits post-9/11 veterans who serve on a new set of frontlines. Their mission: mitigating wildfires in high-risk communities and forests. Through workforce development, this program supports veterans transitioning from military service to civilian life. They provide boots on the ground, battling climate change. So as we celebrate 30 years of AmeriCorps, we are looking to the future. Not only to the future of service, but to our role in uniting Americans in service across divides to build a sustainable economy that supports every American. With the American Climate Corps we are expanding what is possible and living up to President Biden’s call “for a new era of national service.” How we come together as one people – one nation – to address the urgent climate crisis that threatens us all will be the lasting legacy of this generation."

Gavin Newsom drew loud cheers and applause on Wednesday when he spoke at the UN’s Climate Ambition Summit in New York, after pointedly calling the climate crisis “a fossil fuel crisis.”                                             ","Ella Nilsen, CNN","California Gov. Gavin Newsom drew loud cheers and applause on Wednesday when he spoke at the UN’s Climate Ambition Summit in New York, after pointedly calling the climate crisis “a fossil fuel crisis.” He told the room full of global leaders, climate advocates and non-governmental organizations the world needs to phase out oil, gas and coal and castigated the fossil fuel industry for “deceit and denial.” He was also the lone US official who spoke at the UN secretary general’s hand-picked summit, though climate envoy John Kerry also attended. It was an overwhelming response from an audience of people who, while optimistic about humanity’s ability to solve the climate crisis, are cynically used to hearing leaders give the issue watered-down lip service. “Everyone was clapping and saying, ‘This is what we were expecting from the US leadership the whole time,’” Frances Colón, senior director of international climate policy for the Center for American Progress, told CNN. Newsom’s moment in the spotlight capped several weeks of significant action in California that bolstered its reputation as a climate juggernaut. It launched a major lawsuit against five big oil companies for what it calls a long-standing pattern of deceiving the public on the effect of their products. Its legislature passed a raft of climate and clean energy measures, including first-of-its-kind bills mandating large companies disclose their planet-warming pollution and climate risk. This is all in addition to California’s move to ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035, which has the power to impact the entire US auto market, given 17 other states followed its lead. California has always pushed the envelope on climate policy, but its legislative supermajorities, significant legal resources and policy acumen are giving it increasingly national impact. “California was a lab experiment, now it’s a leader,” former California Air Resources Board member Daniel Sperling told CNN. “Others are following, as opposed to it being a one-off.” California has faced a firehose of extreme climate impacts in the past several years. Wildfires have wrought deadly devastation, reservoirs have plummeted amid historic drought and – in a remarkable bout of weather whiplash – more than a dozen atmospheric rivers flooded towns and caused hundreds of landslides. California’s lawsuit against BP, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and ConocoPhillips and their trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, accuses them of decades of public deception that resulted in billions of dollars in harm from climate change-fueled disasters. California Attorney General Rob Bonta told CNN the case is a “game changer” and a “watershed moment” for climate litigation. “This is based on a very simple but powerful premise of fairness and the fact that you are responsible for your actions, so you must be held accountable,” Bonta said. “The people of California don’t deserve to be lied to and have the costs of climate change shifted to them while these big oil companies profit to the tune of billions and billions of dollars every year.” The lawsuit claims the oil companies created a public nuisance, damaged natural resources and state property and violated California law. It seeks injunctive relief and proposes fossil fuel companies pay what Bonta said could be “tens of billions of dollars, if not approaching or even exceeding hundreds of billions” into a new abatement fund that would help the state deal with future climate damages. “When it comes to wildfires, that can be forest management or increased wildfire response,” Bonta said. “When it comes to drought, there can be water storage and water distribution. When it comes to sea rise, there can be sea walls built. For extreme heat, cooling centers. We’re asking fossil fuel companies for the abatement plan to pay for it instead of doing what they’re doing now, which is forcing Californians to bear those costs.” In response to the lawsuit, Ryan Meyers, the Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the American Petroleum Institute trade group, previously told CNN he believes the industry has achieved its goal of providing affordable and reliable energy while “substantially reducing emissions and our environmental footprint.” California isn’t the first state to challenge Big Oil in court. But the California suit is significant for the size of the state’s economy and its vast legal resources. “We had never seen a gorilla come in to put forward a case against fossil fuel companies,” Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said during Thursday remarks. “That is a major, major upgrade in the liabilities and the reach that climate litigation can have.” Bonta said the case could take months or even years to get through a trial but emphasized previous courts have ruled California can pursue the case against Big Oil on its merits – clearing a major jurisdictional hurdle. “These cases have not gotten to the merits yet, but now they can, and they will,” Bonta told CNN. “We have the full power and force of California and our California Department of Justice behind this case.” Among the dozens of bills that passed the Democratic-controlled legislature this session, one grawing the most headlines will require thousands of major companies operating in California and make more than $1 billion a year disclose their climate pollution – even the pollution coming from the use of their products. California’s major companies and banks, including Apple, Salesforce and Wells Fargo, would have to disclose their pollution if the bill is signed, which Newsom has promised to do. Another bill that could work in tandem with the pollution disclosures would require companies making more than $500 million to publicly disclose the ways climate change impacts their financial risk. The repercussions of both bills are still unknown, experts said – and there is a chance the disclosures won’t be accurate given corporations would be responsible for self-reporting. “The answer is no one really knows what the effect will be of those disclosure requirements,” Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program, told CNN. “There would have to be some kind of monitoring and enforcement mechanism, otherwise a company could say whatever they wanted.” Still, Stavins said the greenhouse gas disclosure bill is significant, and “novel, in terms of legislation.” Other measures passed by the California legislature this year include a bill that would speed the development of floating offshore wind farms, as well as a bill making offshore oil and gas development more difficult to get approved. The legislature also approved a bill to make the state’s school buses zero-emission vehicles by 2035. Newsom has not yet said whether he will sign the bills. California is the world’s fifth largest economy, and what it does matters nationally. More than a dozen other states are following its lead on measures including enacting strict vehicle emissions standards and banning sales of new gas cars by 2035, experts told CNN. Sperling, the former CARB board member who was one of the people responsible for designing the state’s vehicle emissions standards, said he was thinking about the bigger picture. “I saw it as my role to be constantly reminding everyone that what California does with greenhouse gases in California is almost irrelevant in terms of the actual emissions,” he said. “Its importance comes from being a leader; having others follow us.” Sperling said California and the states that follow its emissions regulations make up about a third of the US market, potentially making federal emissions regulations “not that hard to meet given California and the other states are already pulling so many EVs in the market.” Even so, Stavins said California’s actions are not a silver-bullet climate solution for the US. Conservative states will likely remain untouched by the impacts of California’s legislation and lawsuits. “California is not the US, the California legislature is not the US Congress, and the California governor is not the president,” Stavins said. “Be careful about thinking that because something works in California, it will work politically in other parts of the country, or nationally.” CNN’s Caroll Alvarado and Rachel Ramirez contributed to this report."

","Nouran Salahieh, CNN","Ophelia, now a post-tropical cyclone, continues to weaken as it moves over the mid-Atlantic Sunday, leaving nearly nine million people from Long Island to Southern Maryland under coastal flood alerts. Areas from eastern Pennsylvania to just south of Long Island could see heavy rainfall Sunday, potentially leading to scattered instances of flash flooding. The National Weather Service warned flooding could be significant enough to close roads and threaten homes and businesses in some areas. The heavy rain will shift northeast on Sunday to over parts of New England and the Northern mid-Atlantic as a weakening Ophelia continues its trek up the East Coast, forecasters said. “The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable,” the Weather Prediction Center said. New York City issued a travel advisory through Sunday, warning of a “a long-duration rainfall event.” “While the warmer summer days are behind us, New Yorkers should take precautions regarding the forecast for high winds and rain during our first fall weekend,” said NYC Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol. TRACK THE STORM New Yorkers who live in basement apartments in flood-prone areas were told to prepare to move to higher ground and avoid driving on flooded streets or entering flooded subway stations. A coastal flood warning was also issued Saturday for communities in New Jersey’s Atlantic City, where several roads were closed due to flooding. “With high tide right around now along the Atlantic coast, we are getting numerous reports from coastal communities of street flooding and road closures,” the weather service office in Mount Holly posted on X, formerly Twitter. Ophelia was a tropical storm at near-hurricane strength when it made landfall near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, early Saturday, knocking out power, flooding coastal streets and forcing rescues. States of emergency were declared in Virginia, North Carolina and Maryland. The storm weakened throughout the day and disbanded into a post-tropical low by Saturday night, with little change in strength forecast over the next couple of days. Now, Ophelia, with sustained winds of 35 mph, is expected to keep moving over southeastern Virginia and then over the Delmarva Peninsula Sunday, before dissipating Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. For now, Ophelia’s key threats include: As Ophelia started lashing North Carolina, storm surge flooded coastal areas and inlets in the state overnight with wind gusts of 73 mph hitting Cape Lookout, along the state’s Outer Banks. Five people, including three children, aboard an anchored sailing vessel were rescued from Lookout Bight Friday, officials said. The group were faced with 35 to 40 mph winds and 6-foot to 8-foot seas, according to the US Coast Guard. “The owner of the vessel did not feel comfortable in the channel and requested to be rescued,” the Coast Guard said. No one was injured. Meanwhile, some areas were dealing with storm surge, an abnormal rise of water generated by the storm. Residents of Washington, North Carolina, were warned to “avoid the downtown area” on Saturday as about 3 to 4 feet of storm surge from Ophelia sent waters over the city’s boardwalk area, a city Facebook post read. In New Bern, which sits along two rivers in North Carolina about 120 miles east of Raleigh, roads were flooded and water crept inland as the levels rose in the downtown area, city officials said on Facebook. Photos posted on the city’s social media page show a flooded children’s park and ducks swimming through flooded streets. Emergency crews in New Bern barricaded flooded areas of the city, including Union Point Park, which “looks like a lake,” city officials said Saturday morning. At one point Saturday, as many as 70,000 homes and businesses across North Carolina and Virginia lost power as winds battered the coast. Many of those customers had power restored by the end of the day, according to poweroutage.us. CNN’s Lauren Mascarenhas, Aya Elamroussi, Melissa Alonso and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","This weekend may have marked the beginning of spring in the Southern Hemisphere, but it felt like the peak of summer across several countries in South America, where temperatures pushed above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil have all experienced record September temperatures, with some all-time records at risk of falling as the heat continues into the week. The very high temperatures are the result of a heat dome, which occurs when a ridge of high pressure builds over an area and stays for days or even weeks, trapping hot air. El Niño, a natural climate pattern that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean, has also increased the heat, as has the underlying trend of human-caused global warming. Peru has experienced some of the most extreme temperatures in September, which is usually a temperate month. The town of Puerto Esperanza saw temperatures climb above 40 degrees Celsius, an extreme rarity for the country, and only 1 degree Celsius shy of the its all-time highest temperature of 41.1 degrees Celsius (106 Fahrenheit). Towns and cities across several other South American countries also saw September heat records topple on Sunday, including: Heat was particularly widespread in Brazil, where temperatures reached 40 degrees Celsius in 11 states on Sunday, according to weather company MetSul Meteorologia. São Paulo reached 36.5 degrees Celsius (98 Fahrenheit), the city’s highest September temperature since 1943, according to INMET, the national meteorological service. These scorching temperatures capped off the city’s warmest winter in more than six decades. Abnormally high temperatures have also increased the fire risk in the country, with wildfires breaking out last week in Bahia state. The extreme heat is expected to continue across parts of South America well into this week, with the potential for more records to be broken. “More of the same – or worse – is unavoidable,” said Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist and weather historian who tracks extreme temperatures. Other parts of the Southern Hemisphere are also experiencing an exceptionally hot spring, including Australia, which is grappling with unusually high temperatures and dozens of bushfires. The country is experiencing “a September like none before, after the warmest winter on record,” Herrera said in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter). Between June and August, 98% of humanity experienced climate change-fueled temperatures, according to a recent analysis from climate research group Climate Central. “In every country we could analyze, including the Southern Hemisphere where this is the coolest time of year, we saw temperatures that would be difficult — and in some cases nearly impossible — without human-caused climate change,” Andrew Pershing, vice president of science for Climate Central, said in a statement earlier this month. Extreme heat is one of the clearest signs of climate change, as humans continue to burn planet-heating fossil fuels. The Northern Hemisphere experienced its hottest summer on record this year, with June, July and August all breaking global monthly heat records. As the abnormal heat continues, the signs are pointing to September also being the hottest such month on record. There is now a more than a 93% chance that this year will be the warmest on record, according to the United States’ National Atmospheric and Oceanographic Administration. CNN’s Brandon Miller contributed reporting"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/25/weather/el-nino-winter-us-climate/index.html,An El Niño winter is coming. Here’s what that could mean for the US,09-25-2023,"                                                 Fall has only just begun, but it’s not too soon to look ahead to winter, especially since this one may look drastically different than recent years because of El Niño.                                             ","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Fall has only just begun, but it’s not too soon to look ahead to winter, especially since this one may look drastically different than recent years because of El Niño. This winter will be the first in a few years to feel the effects of the phenomenon, which has a sizable impact on the weather during the coldest months of the year. El Niño is one of three phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which tracks water temperature changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that can have rippling effects on weather patterns around the globe. The El Niño phase occurs when these ocean temperatures are warmer than normal for an extended period. This year’s El Niño began in June, is expected to be strong this winter and last at least into early next spring, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. El Niño’s cooler counterpart, La Niña, played a huge role in the past three winters across the US, keeping the South dry while parts of the West received a lot of much-needed snow. Early winter predictions from the Climate Prediction Center have many of the hallmarks of typical El Niño winters, auguring changes to come. No two El Niño winters are the same, but many have temperature and precipitation trends in common. One of the major reasons is the position of the jet stream, which often shifts south during an El Niño winter. This shift typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the South while the North becomes drier and warmer, according to NOAA. Because the jet stream is essentially a river of air that storms flow through, they can move across the South with increased frequency during an El Niño winter. More storms means more precipitation, typically from the southern Plains to the Southeast. This could be crucial for states like Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi plagued by drought. The combination of cooler weather and more frequent precipitation may also increase the chances for wintry precipitation like freezing rain, sleet and snow to fall in the South. El Niño typically leads to a milder winter in the North, from the Pacific Northwest to the Rockies, Plains and Midwest. Individual storms can still form and deliver bouts of brutal cold or heavy snow to these regions, but they are typically less frequent. This would be bad news for portions of the Midwest also dealing with extreme and exceptional levels of drought, and for snowpack in the Pacific Northwest – a key water source for the region. El Niño winter patterns are less regular in California, the Southwest and the Northeast. The frequency of storms and uptick in precipitation across California and portions of the Southwest may depend on the overall strength of the El Niño. A stronger El Niño may lead to more storms, low elevation rain and high elevation snow, while a weaker version could hang the Southwest out to dry. The Northeast doesn’t have a well-defined set of expectations during an El Niño winter. The region can be milder overall like its other northern counterparts, but it can also be at the mercy of robust coastal storms moving along the Atlantic Coast. Looking back at recent El Niño winters can also help visualize what the upcoming winter may have in store:"

","Anna Cooban, CNN","Global demand for oil, natural gas and coal is likely to peak by 2030 — an “encouraging” development but “not nearly enough” to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday. Planet-heating pollution from the energy sector is also set to peak this decade, the IEA said in an update to its landmark “Net Zero Roadmap” report. Fatih Birol, the agency’s executive director, told reporters Tuesday that the “path to the 1.5 degrees target is narrowing” but there were “legitimate reasons to be hopeful.” “Mainly, we are seeing that a new clean energy economy is emerging around the world,” he said. Scientists consider warming of 1.5 degrees a threshold beyond which extreme heat, floods, droughts, wildfires, and food and water shortages will have a catastrophic impact. This year’s summer in the Northern Hemisphere was the world’s hottest on record, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Scientists also say that to stay in line with the 1.5 degree cap, global greenhouse gas emissions must go down to zero by 2050 on a net basis, taking account of all the emissions produced and removed from the atmosphere. Since the original publication of the “Net Zero Roadmap” report in 2021, the world has seen “record growth” in solar power capacity, as well as bumper sales of electric vehicles, the IEA wrote. In the past two years, “solar became the king of electricity markets,” Birol said. “The old king — coal — is over, and now solar is the new king… the cost is coming down.” Two years ago, he added, one in every 25 new cars sold around the world was electric. This year, that share has increased to one in every five. And more than 80% of the emissions reductions needed by 2030 can be achieved through expanding renewable energy sources, increasing electrification, improving energy efficiency and cutting methane emissions, according to the IEA. Still, limiting global warming is a “herculean task,” Birol said, noting that achieving the 1.5 degree target would require a 25% plunge in demand for fossil fuels by 2030 compared with current levels. The IEA calculates that investments in clean energy worldwide will need to more than double from the $1.8 trillion projected for this year to $4.5 trillion every year by the early 2030s. Staying on track for 1.5 degrees also means that almost all countries must move forward their target dates for achieving net-zero carbon emissions, it wrote Tuesday. Meanwhile, carbon capture, utilization and storage — a set of technologies that prevents carbon going into the atmosphere at the source of the pollution — as well as hydrogen-based energy and biofuels require “rapid progress” by 2030. The world’s leaders are due to gather in Dubai for the United Nations’ COP28 climate summit in late November to assess the global progress toward limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. In its 2021 report, the IEA said that, to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, investment in new oil and gas projects must stop immediately, and no new coal-fired plants should be approved. But some of the world’s fossil fuel producers have ignored that call. In July, the UK government announced plans to allow a big expansion of drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said at the time that he hoped the plans would provide Britain with domestically sourced energy while the country transitioned to a net-zero economy by 2050. In September, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries — a group that includes the world’s largest crude oil exporter Saudi Arabia — said that halting investment in new oil and gas projects would set up the global energy system to fail “spectacularly.” “It would lead to energy chaos on a potentially unprecedented scale, with dire consequences for economies and billions of people across the world,” Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC’s secretary-general, said in a statement. Oil prices have surged in recent months following a decision by OPEC and its leading ally Russia to slash crude supplies in a bid to prop up prices. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has gained 28% since a low in late June to trade near $93 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has risen by a similar margin to $89 a barrel."

A total of 10% of their ice volume has disappeared over a period of just two years as a combination of low snowfall and soaring temperatures cause unprecedented melting, according to ...","Laura Paddison, CNN","Glaciers in Switzerland are shrinking at a “mind-blowing” rate. A total of 10% of their ice volume has disappeared over a period of just two years as a combination of low snowfall and soaring temperatures cause unprecedented melting, according to figures released Thursday. In 2023, the country’s glaciers lost 4% of their total volume, according to data from the Swiss Commission for Cryosphere Observation of the Swiss Academy of Sciences. This level melting is second only to the record set in 2022, when 6% of glaciers were destroyed. To put this into perspective, Swiss glaciers have lost as much ice over this two-year period as was lost over the three decades between 1960 and 1990. “The losses we’ve seen in 2022 and 2023 are simply mind-blowing and beyond everything we have experienced so far,” said Matthias Huss, head of the Swiss Glacier Monitoring Network (GLAMOS), an organization that collects and evaluates glacier data and works with the Swiss Academy of Sciences. “Even though glaciers have constantly and quickly been losing mass for many decades, this is a tremendous acceleration,” he told CNN, adding these extremes “would have been impossible without climate change.” The two extreme years have led to glacier tongues collapsing and many small glaciers in the country disappearing altogether. The St. Annafirn glacier, for example, in the Uri canton in central Switzerland, has shrunk so much that GLAMOS has stopped monitoring it. Ice loss was even recorded at high altitudes, which usually don’t see such declines. Several meters of ice disappeared in southern Valais and the Engadin valley at altitudes of more than 3,200 meters (10,500 feet), according to GLAMOS. The losses, which affect glaciers across the country, have come after a winter with very low snow. Snow levels in the second half of February reached a record low, at around 30% of the long-term average. This was followed by a summer of high temperatures. A very hot and dry June meant snow melted two to four weeks earlier than usual, according to GLAMOS. In August, a weather balloon launched by the national meteorological service, MétéoSuisse, had to climb 5,298 meters (17,382 feet) before the temperature fell to 0 degrees Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) – marking the highest “zero degree” line since records began. High temperatures, which continued into September, meant that summer snowfalls melted quickly. The huge glacier melt of the last two years has stark implications. It “means a significant re-shaping of the high-alpine landscape,” Huss said. It is creating dangerous conditions with unstable rock threatening dangerous rockslides. Receding glaciers are also leading to grim discoveries. In July, the remains of a German mountain climber who went missing 37 years ago while hiking along a glacier near Switzerland’s famous Matterhorn were recovered. There are temporary advantages as the water runoff from the glaciers has helped relieve the severity of the drought the country has experienced and fill hydropower reservoirs, said Huss. “However, this benefit is transient and short-lived,” he added. As they shrink, glaciers are rapidly losing their important role to contribute water when people need it. “This will aggravate water scarcity during heat waves in the near future,” Huss said. The long-term picture for Switzerland’s glaciers is alarming. “Glaciers in the Alps will continue to massively shrink and retreat to the highest mountain peaks,” said Huss. In June, Swiss voters agreed a new law to significantly reduce levels of planet-heating pollution, the impetus for which came from climate groups demanding an end to fossil fuels in order to save the glaciers. But time is running out as climate change accelerates. Recent research found that even if ambitious climate targets are met, up to half of the world’s glaciers could disappear by the end of the century."

","Rachel Ramirez and Ella Nilsen, CNN","Hurricanes, heat and humidity have always been looming threats on the Gulf Coast. But as drought grows in the Central US and sea level rises, residents in southern Louisiana are finding a formerly unusual emergency is becoming more frequent: saltwater is infecting drinking water city by city up the Mississippi River. Ocean water has already polluted the drinking water for thousands of residents in Plaquemines Parish. The Army Corps of Engineers predicts it will contaminate the water systems that serve tens of thousands more residents, including those in New Orleans, in the coming weeks. Extreme drought and sea level rise are colliding in Louisiana, and John Callahan, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s center for operational oceanographic products and services, said it will only become a bigger problem in a future made hotter and drier by planet-warming pollution. “The historic low flows on the Mississippi River right now are due to low precipitation and high temperatures,” Callahan told CNN. “Droughts are expected to be more frequent if warming continues, which is expected.” For Louisiana, the future arrived this summer, as the state’s deadly combo of heat, drought and fires has “basically never really occurred in living memory,” Joshua Lewis, research director at Tulane University’s ByWater Institute, told CNN. “It was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced here before, and it does paint a very challenging picture,” he said. “For residents of the region, it can feel like you’re kind of waking up in a new environment every morning, and there’s these new threats that emerge.” Saltwater intrusion is just another disastrous layer that the climate crisis has added to a flurry of extreme weather events. Along with blistering heat and extreme drought, Louisiana also recorded an unprecedented number of wildfires, that forced several towns to evacuate and state officials imposed a burn ban. Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, the praised former commander of the First Army who became widely known for coordinating Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, said he never thought he’d be praying for rain at the peak of hurricane season in the Gulf. “It’s climate change. That’s the dilemma we have — manmade activity is exacerbating the warming of the Earth that is causing severe changes in weather patterns,” Honoré told CNN. “In all my years, I’ve never remembered we’ve gotten fire and in all my years here, I’ve never seen our properties’ farms empty, because they have no water due to the drought.” Low flow rates on the Mississippi River can’t keep saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico out. Since saltwater is denser than freshwater, it travels upstream along the bottom of the river in a wedge-like shape, infiltrating water systems as it goes. “Saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico is always in continual contact with freshwater flow from the river,” Callahan told CNN. “Right now, due to low freshwater flow, the saltwater from the Gulf is winning and is pushing farther north.” Part of the challenge this year is the river has still not recovered from the back-to-back, low-water years, said Robert Miller, a coastal hydrologist and professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. “This is not typical,” Miller told CNN. “When you have a back-to-back situation, the salinity will keep creeping in. It’s a buildup, it’s a cumulative effect.” Past low-water years have been followed by normal wet years, he added, which brings river levels back up and dilutes the salt water. “I think the challenge for the (Army) Corps of Engineers and other responsible institutions is to take a hard look at the procedures that are in place and be ready to respond to these kinds of back-to-back events and be able to switch modes,” between flood and drought mitigation, Lewis said. “It’s going to require a lot of coordination and personnel, technology and research to be sure that we’re able to respond to these events as they emerge even in back-to-back years,” he added. This emergency requires a well-planned engineering response because even if water users upstream reduced their usage, it would likely not be enough to dilute the amount of salt water currently seeping in from the Gulf. The current drought is “basin-wide,” Miller said, and “everyone upstream is dealing with low water and limited supplies as well.” “The Missouri River provides water to the Mississippi, but the Missouri River is so far upstream,” he said. “That water spreads out and it attenuates; even if you release a nice slug of water, its spreads out. I doubt it would do enough to push back a saltwater wedge.” With conservation unable to solve the problem, Louisiana and the Army Corps are focusing on bigger ticket items: reverse osmosis units to filter salt out of drinking water; a 55-foot-tall underwater levee to slow the spread of the saltwater wedge; a plan to barge millions of gallons of freshwater downstream to the water systems that are overwhelmed with salt. But water barges and filtering will not be enough to prevent saltwater from contaminating New Orleans’ water facilities, officials said at a meeting on Wednesday. Barring significant rainfall, a multimillion-dollar pipeline will be needed to deliver freshwater from upstream. As expensive solutions accumulate, Miller, who is an engineer specializing in flood control, said Louisiana and other Mississippi River states have been conditioned to deal with flooding — less so with what happens when there is not enough water. “Much of the defense has been for floods, and rightfully so,” Miller said. “In my humble opinion, having worked in this area, I think [with] low water, we are maybe less prepared for dealing with that compared to floods.”"

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Experts fear an already active hurricane season could come to an eventful and exceptional end as unusually warm, storm-boosting ocean temperatures and a slow-to-emerge El Niño combine. The Atlantic season and its 18 named storms has already been above average, according to Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher with Colorado State University. But October usually signals changes in activity and the areas where storms form. The first half of October is typically the final stretch of the busiest time of the Atlantic hurricane season. The number of storms usually begins to drop off quickly toward the end of October and craters by the time the season ends on November 30. Storms that do form typically do so in areas that are much too close for comfort – in the Gulf of Mexico, near the Bahamas and the western Caribbean – rather than in the open Atlantic, where storms like Category 5 Hurricane Lee formed earlier this year. This means places like Florida, which was devastated by Category 5 Hurricane Michael’s landfall in October 2018, need to be on particular guard in a normal October. However, extremely high sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic “expand the reach of where something might form” into the late season this year, Brian McNoldy, a Senior Research Associate at the University of Miami, told CNN. This could mean more storms develop late into the season in the main development region, a large section of the open Atlantic Ocean that stretches from Africa to the eastern Caribbean. If this were to happen, parts of the eastern Caribbean, Bermuda and the East Coast could still be at risk for tropical strikes. The battle between warm ocean water and the effect of El Niño has posed a forecasting challenge throughout this hurricane season, as one factor is seemingly negating the other. El Niño typically causes strong upper-level winds in the Atlantic, which suppress hurricane activity. But weaker upper-level winds – which are more favorable for hurricanes to develop – tend to be associated with warmer ocean temperatures, which is exactly what we have seen this year, Fischer explained. On balance, the warmer ocean temperatures and weaker winds are winning, and more storms have been able to form than would otherwise be possible in a typical El Niño year, Klotzbach previously told CNN. This clash is expected to continue into October and November. “Usually as we get into the back half of the hurricane season, El Niño tends to dominate, even if the Atlantic is warm. But we’ve just never seen anything this warm,” Michael Fischer, an Associate Scientist with the University of Miami, told CNN. This could leave the Atlantic open to more tropical activity in general through the rest of the season, according to Fischer, but it remains to be seen. “So we’re kind of in uncharted waters, if you will, and it’s tough to make any kind of confident forecast because of that,” Fischer told CNN. One thing is for certain, though: Any tropical system that does form would likely get an “extra boost” in strength from the exceptionally warm water, according to McNoldy. This has already been demonstrated by multiple storms this season, including Hurricane Idalia and Hurricane Lee – both of which rapidly intensified while moving over extremely warm water. It’s possible that upper-level winds will remain at abnormally low levels across the main development region and the Caribbean, where the effect of El Niño is typically most pronounced, according to Fischer. This, combined with high ocean temperatures, may leave nothing standing in the way of tropical development. “Is El Niño at some point going to say, ‘Forget this, I’m in charge?’” Klotzbach said. “I don’t see massive signs of that.” If conditions continue to be ripe for tropical development through the end of hurricane season, it’ll add onto what has already been an abnormal season. “There are a lot of things going on this year that are unusual” in the Atlantic, Klotzbach added. “We have an Atlantic that’s in a different kind of league from other years.”"

States like Louisiana — which endured its hottest summer on record this year — will have below-normal afternoon temperatures for the first time since spring. The change will begin in portions of the Plains and Midwest that have been baking in record-breaking October heat since Saturday. Dozens of daily temperature records have fallen there, and some cities in Minnesota and Michigan smashed all-time October temperature records. While the most brutal heat will soon come to an end across the north-central US, summerlike heat is only beginning to build for the Northeast. Temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal October levels will be common through Thursday across the Great Lakes and Northeast. It won’t last for long. The coldest air of the season will arrive late this week and usher in conditions that haven’t been felt since early May across the northern US. A one-two punch of cold air from two separate cold fronts will surge across the central US starting Wednesday and expand into the eastern US Friday and through the weekend. High temperatures from the Great Lakes to New York could drop by as much as 35 degrees by the weekend. Temperature drops of 20 degrees will be more widespread. The first cold front will bring relief to states in the north-central US from Wednesday to Thursday. Places like Minneapolis, where record-breaking temperatures soared into the 90s on Sunday, may not make it out of the 60s on Wednesday. The second cold front will be much more potent and usher in the season’s first push of truly autumn air for the central and eastern US. Chilly, Canadian air will surge southward as the cold front digs across the eastern two-thirds of the continental US from Thursday to Sunday. Places like Detroit and Cleveland – that soar into the upper 80s on Wednesday – may not climb out of the low 50s on Sunday. Philadelphia and New York City will likely bask in the 80s through at least Wednesday, but by Sunday, high temperatures will struggle to reach the low 60s. Overnight low temperatures will also plummet behind these fronts. Low temperatures in the upper 30s to low 50s are likely across the north-central US and Midwest by Saturday morning, and in the Northeast by Sunday morning. The first frost of the season is possible for portions of northern states like North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin as temperatures drop into the low to middle 30s. Chilly fall weather should stick around early this month, especially in the eastern US. Below-average temperatures are likely from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast through at least the middle of next week, according to the Climate Prediction Center. The dramatic cooldown won’t be the only noticeable weather change this week. The clash between cold, autumnal air and steamy, summerlike air will create stormy weather. The storm threat on Wednesday will stretch from the southern Plains to the Midwest. Some storms may turn severe on Wednesday afternoon, mainly in Texas and Oklahoma. Any rain from these storms is sorely needed in Texas, where 80% of the state is experiencing at least moderate drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. From Tuesday through Wednesday, 0.75 to 1.50 inches of rain could fall across much of the state, with higher amounts possible in areas worked over by multiple storms. Rain and thunderstorms will continue to march slowly eastward and impact portions of the eastern US Thursday and Friday, while wet weather continues in the Midwest. Periods of heavy rain are possible the Northeast over the weekend. Any heavy rainfall could pose an issue for parts of the region plunged underwater by flooding rainfall last week."

The severity of rain and wind will be the same regardless of whether it’s a tropical storm or a post-tropical storm at landfall. For now, portions of New England and eastern New York are most likely to experience heavy rain and potential flooding. A Level 2 of 4 slight risk of excessive rainfall was issued for Saturday in these areas by NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. But the bull’s-eye of heaviest rainfall could shift if low pressure moving across the eastern US pulls Philippe closer to the Northeast. This potential shift could move the risk closer to the mid-Atlantic – an area where another deluge would be particularly worrisome. Heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week, but a widespread 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible north of New York City in New York and into New England. Higher amounts closer up to 5 inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, most likely in Maine. Heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week, but a widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain is possible across New York and New England. Higher amounts closer to 2 to 4 inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, likely in Maine. In addition to heavy rain, gusty winds are possible across portions of New England and Atlantic Canada Saturday night into Sunday as Philippe comes ashore. Philippe has quite a distance to travel before approaching the US and Canada but it will soon come in close contact with Bermuda. The island’s weather service issued a tropical storm warning Wednesday evening as Philippe closed in. Bermuda is only 15 miles across, so landfalls are rare. Only eleven systems have made landfall on the island since 1851, according to data from NOAA. But Philippe won’t have to make landfall in order to unload strong wind gusts and heavy rain. The Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for the island on Wednesday, since Philippe won’t have to make landfall in order to unload strong wind gusts and heavy rain. Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are likely across Bermuda when Philippe makes its closest pass on Friday. Rain arrived on Thursday afternoon, ahead of any wind. Philippe is expected to be a tropical storm as it swipes the island, so the risk of widespread damage is limited, but power outages are possible."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","As the world rapidly urbanizes, the amount of building in flood-prone areas is soaring, according to new research, sparking concerns about people’s vulnerability to disasters as the climate crisis escalates. Between 1985 and 2015, the number of settlements – from small villages to mega-cities – with the highest flood hazard exposure increased by 122%, according to the study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday. “In a time when human settlements should be adapting to climate change, many countries are actually rapidly increasing their exposure to floods,” said Paolo Avner, senior economist at the World Bank and a lead author on the study. “This is a concerning trend, especially as climate change is intensifying flood disasters worldwide,” he told CNN. Researchers analyzed global flood hazard datasets and annual settlement footprint data covering the three decades between 1985 and 2015 to understand the populations most affected by flood risk. They found over this period, as the world’s settlements grew by 85%, urbanization happened much more rapidly in high-hazard flood zones than in areas with low flood risk. In 2015, more than 11% of built-up areas globally faced high or very high flood risk, meaning areas at risk of flooding depths of at least 50 cm (17 inches) during 1-in-100-year flooding events, according to the report. Exposure to all types of flooding is increasing, but vulnerability to coastal flooding is increasing at the fastest pace, the report found. The researchers concluded that flood risks are substantial across all regions of the world and all income groups, but some face higher risks than others. Exposure is highest in East Asia and the Pacific region, and lowest in North America and sub-Saharan Africa, according to the report. Upper-middle income countries had the largest proportion of new human settlements in the highest flood risk zones, the report found. These results were driven by China, which has experienced very swift urbanization, and is home to nearly half of all new settlements built in high flood hazard areas between 1985 and 2015. While higher income countries mostly saw relatively slow growth in flood-prone zones over the 30 year period, many – including the US, Japan and the Netherlands – already had many settlements in areas at high risk of flooding before 1985 and have had to spend large amounts to protect them, according to the report. There are many reasons why the amount of building on land vulnerable to flooding is shooting up, but scarcity is a major driver. Land that is safer from floods has largely been built on already, meaning new development is disproportionately happening in floodplains and other areas that would have previously been avoided. In Vietnam, for example, where around one-third of coastal land is built on, new developments are being forced into hazardous land, the report found. Sometimes the economic opportunities are assumed to outweigh the risk of disaster, such as for major port cities, beachfront communities or tourist areas. Other reasons include a lack of flood data, poor urban planning or weak regulation. Southwest Florida, at risk from increasingly severe hurricanes, has seen populations explode due to its sunny weather and relative cheapness. That growth came as the state loosened regulations around building in high-risk and low-lying areas. The report recommended a number of actions for policymakers and planners, including investment in disaster preparedness, early warning systems and evacuation plans in areas where flood risk is already high, as well as revising land use plans and building codes in areas where the risk is growing. Robert Nicholls, professor of climate adaptation at the University of East Anglia who was not involved in the study, said the report’s methodology was robust and its findings were “new but not surprising.” While there is often a strong emphasis on “deeper or more frequent floods,” he told CNN, “flood risk is also affected by changes in exposure and vulnerability – if these increase so does risk.” The study shows exposure is increasing significantly, he added. “This is concerning as development patterns are enhancing risk without climate change – climate change will further exacerbate these risks in the future.”"

","Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN","Pope Francis has made his strongest statement yet on the accelerating climate crisis, pinning blame on big industries and world leaders as well as “irresponsible” Western lifestyles, in a blistering statement on Wednesday. “Our responses have not been adequate, while the world in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point,” the pontiff wrote in a 7,000 word encyclical called Laudate Deum (“Praise God”). “Some effects of the climate crisis are already irreversible, at least for several hundred years, such as the increase in the global temperature of the oceans, their acidification and the decrease of oxygen,” he wrote. The pope leveled heavy criticism at climate change deniers and delayers. “Despite all attempts to deny, conceal, gloss over or relativize the issue, the signs of climate change are here and increasingly evident. No one can ignore the fact that in recent years we have witnessed extreme weather phenomena, frequent periods of unusual heat, drought and other cries of protest,” he wrote. Climate change will likely only get worse and ignoring it will heighten “the probability of extreme phenomena that are increasingly frequent and intense,” he wrote. The pope paid particular attention to the disproportionate responsibility of rich countries for climate change. “If we consider that emissions per individual in the United States are about two times greater than those of individuals living in China, and about seven times greater than the average of the poorest countries, we can state that a broad change in the irresponsible lifestyle connected with the Western model would have a significant long-term impact,” he wrote. He also leveled blame at leaders and businesses which he said prioritize short-term profits and gains over climate action. “Regrettably, the climate crisis is not exactly a matter that interests the great economic powers, whose concern is with the greatest profit possible at minimal cost and in the shortest amount of time.” He even directed criticism at his own church, referring to “certain dismissive and scarcely reasonable opinions that I encounter, even within the Catholic Church.” The pope’s statement is a follow-up to his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si (“Praised Be To You”), which was the first ever ponitifcal writing completely dedicated to ecological issues, which have been a cornerstone of his papacy. It comes ahead of the UN COP28 climate conference, which starts at the end of November in Dubai, where countries will undergo “global stocktake” to assess how quickly they are progressing towards climate goals."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","The Northern Hemisphere may be transitioning into fall, but there has been no let up from extreme heat. New data shows last month was the hottest September – the fourth consecutive month of such unprecedented heat – putting 2023 firmly on track to be the hottest year in recorded history. September beat the previous monthly record set in 2020 by a staggering 0.5 degrees Celsius, according to data released Wednesday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. There has never been a month so abnormally hot since Copernicus’ records began in 1940. “The unprecedented temperatures for the time of year observed in September – following a record summer – have broken records by an extraordinary amount,” said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, in a statement. September felt more like an abnormally hot July with an average global air temperature of 16.38 degrees Celsius (61.45 Fahrenheit), making the month 0.93 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1991 to 2020 average, and 1.75 degrees Celsius hotter than the September average for the pre-industrial era, before the world started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. That’s well above the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold to which countries aim to limit global warming under the Paris Climate Agreement. While that agreement focuses on longterm average temperatures, September’s abnormal heat – which followed the hottest summer ever recorded – has given a preview of what the world can expect as soaring temperatures supercharge extreme weather. September alone brought devastating flooding that killed thousands in Libya and dozens across Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. Canada grappled with its unprecedented wildfire season, parts of South America were scorched by record-breaking heat and record rainfall deluged New York. Ocean temperatures were also off the charts in September. Average sea surface temperatures reached 20.92 degrees Celsius (69.66 Fahrenheit), the highest on record for September and the second-highest on record for any month, after August of this year. Antarctic sea ice also reached record lows for this time of year. “This month was, in my professional opinion as a climate scientist – absolutely gobsmackingly bananas,” Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist, posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday. Even in October, there is little sign of heat dying down. European countries, including Spain, Poland, Austria and France, have already broken their all-time October temperature records, according to Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist and weather historian who tracks extreme temperatures. What Europe experienced in the first three days of October was “one of the most extreme (climate) events in European history,” Herrera posted on X on Tuesday. It now appears all but certain that this year will be the hottest year on record. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration puts the chances of reaching this milestone at more than 93%. The extreme September “has pushed 2023 into the dubious honor of first place – on track to be the warmest year and around 1.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial average temperatures,” Burgess said. The high temperatures have been partially fueled by El Niño, the natural climate pattern that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean and has a warming effect. But underlying that pattern is the longterm trend of human-caused climate change. “Temperature records continue to be broken because we have not stopped burning fossil fuels. It is that simple,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in the UK. The significant margin by which heat records are being broken matters, she told CNN. “People and ecosystems are dying.” Countries will gather in Dubai for the United Nations COP28 climate summit in December where they will assess progress towards climate goals. The world is currently a long way off track, according to a recent report. “The significant margin by which the September record was broken should be a wake-up call for policymakers and negotiators ahead of COP28,” Otto said, “we absolutely must agree to phase out fossil fuels.”"

That works out to 20,000 children displaced every single day due to extreme weather fueled by climate change. The researchers found that floods and storms caused 95% of all child displacements recorded, with the rest due to drought and wildfires. “It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,” said UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell, in a statement. The report is the first of its kind, according to UNICEF. “Until now, children displaced by weather-related events have been statistically invisible,” the organization said in a statement. East Asia and the Pacific have been particularly affected. In 2020, Cyclone Amphan led to 1.5 million child displacements across India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan. In 2021, Typhoon Rai caused 1.5 million child displacements across the Philippines, Palau and Vietnam. By overall numbers of displacements, three countries dominated: the Philippines, India and China, where a total of 23 million children were forced from their homes and schools across the six-year period. The location and geography of these countries make them prone to floods and storms, which are set to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. However, the report noted that all three countries implement preemptive evacuation plans, meaning children can be moved before a disaster hits, which may account for the higher numbers of displacements. A different picture emerges when looking at the number of children displaced relative to the size of each country’s population. Storms in the small Caribbean island country of Dominica, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, displaced 76% of the child population over the six-year period. South Sudan and Somalia experienced the highest proportion of child displacement from flooding, with 11% and 12% of children having to flee their homes, the report found. Both countries implement far fewer evacuation plans, making children even more vulnerable, according to the report. Meanwhile drought, particularly in Somalia, Ethiopia and Afghanistan has contributed to over 1.3 million children having to leave their homes. However these statistics are likely to be conservative, as there is less data available for slow-onset disasters like drought, the reported noted. Wildfires in the US and Canada have also led to child displacement, and they are likely to cause larger-scale displacements in the future, the report found. “For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but it’s also very disruptive,” UNICEF’s Russell said. Whether short-lived or long-term, displacement can amplify risks of exploitation, child trafficking and abuse, while also exposing children to malnutrition, disease and inadequate immunization, the report found. The situation is poised to get worse. As the human-caused climate crisis accelerates, extreme weather is becoming more severe and more common. With every additional 1 degree Celsius of warming, the global risks of displacement from flooding are projected to rise by 50%, according to research cited in the report. “We have the tools and knowledge to respond to this escalating challenge for children, but we are acting far too slowly,”  Russell said."

The world has already warmed around 1.2 degrees Celsius. “Moist heat stress is a particularly challenging problem, because it affects the human body directly, and causes morbidity and mortality,” said Matthew Huber, co-author of the study and a professor of Earth’s atmospheric and planetary sciences at Purdue University. When levels of heat and humidity are high, sweat evaporates much more slowly than usual meaning its cooling effect is lost and the body can become unable to regulate its temperature. This can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which can cause heart attacks and organ failure. The old, the very young and those with pre-existing health conditions are most vulnerable to heat illness. Temperatures that surpass human tolerance have been breached only a few times in human history, and for a few hours at a time in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, according to the report. But as temperatures continue to rise, many more will be exposed and for much longer periods, the study found. While countries have committed to limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, with the aim of 1.5 degrees Celsius, they are way off track. Even if global climate pledges are met — which the world is not currently on course to do — temperatures are expected to rise between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius, according to a recent UN report. Above 2 degrees of warming, 2.2 billion people who live in Pakistan and the Indus River Valley in India, 1 billion people in China and 800 million people in sub-Saharan Africa will experience many hours of heat and humidity a year that exceed human tolerance levels. People in these regions will be even more vulnerable as many lack access to air conditioning or other ways to cool down, the report noted. At 3 degrees — which the study authors say is the most likely level of warming by 2100 if no action is taken — there is a sharp increase in people exposed to life-threatening heat and humidity. “It’s really incredibly disturbing,” Huber told CNN. Humid heat waves will affect swaths of the world not used to such extreme conditions. The Midwest US will become a “moist heat stress hotspot” at 3 degrees of warming, according to the report. The Midwest is susceptible to this kind of heat stress in part because its climate walks the line between dry and humid, Huber explained, allowing the region’s heat to push into the danger zone on very humid days. Another factor that makes the region vulnerable is its agriculture and the phenomenon called “corn sweat,” Huber said. “The plants that we eat are sweating through evapotranspiration, and that may be adding to the humidity above what would normally be there,” he said. So-called “hot hours” — times where heat and humidity are especially life-threatening — will be concentrated in the Missouri and Mississippi River valleys but also elsewhere in US including the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic seaboard, according to the study. At 4 degrees of warming, the study’s worst-case scenario, researchers found that 1.5 billion people around the world would face a month of moist heat stress each year, and roughly 2.7 billion people will experience at least a week of these extreme conditions. Parts of Yemen could experience heat and humidity that exceeds human tolerance for more than 300 days a year, making it virtually uninhabitable. “Around the world, official strategies for adapting to the weather focus on temperature only,” Qinqin Kong of Purdue University and a study co-author, said in a statement. “But this research shows that humid heat is going to be a much bigger threat than dry heat.” Keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius by cutting planet heating pollution will sharply reduce global exposure to life-threatening heat and humidity, the report found. “Every tenth of a degree or anything like that afterwards plays a role, and we want to reduce warming as fast as we can,” Daniel Vecellio, lead author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at George Mason University, told CNN. “If we get to these emissions reductions faster, here’s all the people we can save, here’s all the lifestyles that don’t have to be changed.” Kim Cobb, climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved with the study but was a lead author on the most recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, said the study’s conclusions are “compelling” but not surprising. “Extreme heat is already responsible for countless deaths worldwide every year,” Cobb told CNN. “It’s important to underscore, as this study does, that heat is not an equal opportunity killer. It disproportionately kills people in lower income communities, often communities of color. This is as true here in the US as it is around the globe.”"

And, perhaps most alarmingly for the IPA lovers of the world, they are starting to lose their critical bitter component. It’s going to get worse, researchers say. Hop yields could decline by as much as 18% by 2050, and their alpha acid content – which makes beer bitter – could decrease by up to 31% due to hotter and drier conditions, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The findings add to a growing list of things the climate crisis threatens yet people take for granted, said Miroslav Trnka, co-author of the study and researcher at the Global Change Research Institute. “One of the side motives of this study was to illustrate how climate change might be important for even those who think it doesn’t matter,” Trnka told CNN. “We are really seeing changes that are affecting things that we value, like the taste of beer. Climate change really can have an effect on it, or at least have an effect on commodities that are critical for production.” Beer brewing has been around since at least 3100 BC, the study notes. Now, each of the basic ingredients of today’s beer — water, barley, yeast and hops – are threatened by global warming. “With climate change affecting a vast number of agricultural crops, I’m not surprised,” said Douglass Miller, a senior lecturer in food and beverage management at Cornell University who is not involved in the study. “Hops are also finicky plants and there might be some crop failures,” Miller said, which could lead brewers to work with different flavor profiles from other types of hops. Researchers used weather data and climate models to analyze how European hops have been and will be affected by climate change between 1970 and 2050, assuming precipitation decreases and temperature increases. Scorching temperatures have already shifted the start of hop growing season by 13 days from 1970 to 2018, according to the study. The growth of new shoots from the hop plant typically occurs during the spring, but since 1995, the researchers found it’s happening earlier in the regions analyzed than years prior. This early onset triggers earlier harvests, which could make it more difficult for hop growers to schedule harvesting and processing operations. In recent years, more consumers are preferring beer aromas and flavors that require higher-quality hops, according to the study. Since these hops are only grown in smaller regions, researchers say they’re put at even higher risk from climate change-fueled heat waves and droughts. “Hop farmers have changed the locations of hop fields in response to changes in temperature and precipitation and that is likely to continue,” said Mark Sorrells, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Integrative Plant Science who is not involved with the study. And while craft brews with aroma hops may be popular now, consumer preferences could change as growers adapt, Sorrells added. While this study only focused on major hop-growing European countries – which cover nearly 90% of the total area of aromatic hop fields in the continent – Trnka said it’s also representative of what could happen in beer-producing regions in the US such as the Pacific Northwest, where record-shattering heatwaves are occurring more often than usual. “They are facing similar problems like European (countries), perhaps a slightly different timing and different frequency but climate change is cumulatively affecting both regions in very similar ways,” Trnka said. Beer remains one of the world’s most widely consumed beverages. Even in a hotter future, people will still find ways to brew it, Trnka said – but it may not taste the same."

","Giri Viswanathan, CNN","Climate change can play a major role in affecting young people’s mental health, according to a new report from the American Psychological Association. Written in collaboration with the climate advocacy organization ecoAmerica, the report documents how environmental events linked to climate change – including weather disasters, extreme heat and poor air quality – can trigger or exacerbate mental health issues for kids and teens. Natural disasters can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder in these groups, the report says. Longer-term problems like heat, drought and poor air quality can increase the risks of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, aggression, cognitive impairment and more. “The report documents psychological harms that are happening right now to the children and youth in our country,” Dr. Dennis P. Stolle, the association’s senior director of applied psychology who reviewed the report, wrote in an email to CNN. “These are not issues that we can wait and resolve later. As a society, we must act now.” The report, released Wednesday, serves as a follow-up to a 2021 study conducted by the American Psychological Association and ecoAmerica. It’s the latest in a series of studies by the two organizations dating to 2014. The studies don’t involve new experiments; rather, they summarize existing research about climate change, mental health and youth development. According to Dr. Sue Clayton, a professor of psychology at the College of Wooster and the report’s lead author, climate change-related weather events leave kids more vulnerable to mental health consequences because young people might not have the coping strategies that adults do. If a parent is stressed by hardship associated with an environmental event, like extreme heat or wildfires, it may influence their children’s mental health, as well. “If your parent is under stress because of worries or these fears, that can affect a child and their mental health,” Clayton said. “Experiencing trauma at an early age can have lifelong impacts on emotional health and well-being.” Those mental health consequences begin even before a child is born, the report says. Prenatal exposure to weather disasters, high temperatures, air pollution and maternal anxiety can raise a child’s risk of a variety of behavioral and developmental issues, including anxiety, depression, ADHD, developmental delays, low self-control and psychiatric disorders. The consequences can affect the development of the nervous system and are often irreversible, Clayton said. For infants and young children, weather events linked to climate change – and exposure to news reports about them – could lead to anxiety, sleep troubles, PTSD, disrupted cognitive development and major depressive disorder. Adolescents are susceptible to mental health effects – like trauma and anxiety – from climate change-related natural disasters, but they can also be indirectly affected, the report says. Weather events, heat and pollution can disrupt a child’s life: classes might be canceled, their home might be damaged, or they might experience food insecurity. Adolescents and young adults, the report says, are particularly anxious about climate change. Compared with their older counterparts, young people are more likely to be alarmed or concerned about the perceived failure of governments or authority figures to act on climate change. According to the report, climate change-related events and distress about the issue are linked to risks of anxiety, depression, strained social relationships and suicide. “They’re worried about it because they know it’s going to affect their future,” Clayton said. “How do you plan for the future when you don’t know what the future will look like?” She is also concerned about how climate change could influence young adults who are making decisions about their career and relationships. The report identified that the consequences of extreme weather and climate anxiety affected decision-making, impaired cognition and lower levels of self-control. “They’re making the decisions that will affect the rest of their lives, in terms of their career goals and plans,” Clayton added. “Are they going to save money? What about their decisions about having children?” The researchers note that not all young people experience the mental health impacts of climate change in the same way. People from marginalized or low-income backgrounds – including indigenous communities, communities of color, women and people with disabilities – are more likely to be exposed to extreme weather. Compared with people in wealthier areas, they may also have fewer ways to cope with extreme weather. For instance, Clayton said, higher-income communities tend to have more tree cover from heat. However, the report also stressed ways to limit the impact of climate change on youth mental health. Among its recommendations are that school systems play a greater role, including designing more protective facilities and teaching curricula about climate change. Health care professionals could also screen early and regularly for climate-related distress among youth. Stolle says a greater number of clinical psychologists are treating people with anxiety about climate change. “Clinical psychologists are finding themselves on the frontlines of treating the patients who are suffering from these concerns,” he wrote in his email. But for Clayton, it’s not just an issue for health care professionals. “This affects all of us,” she added. “Children are effectively the future of society. We wanted to make the information about the problem and potential ways of addressing it available to groups that want to get access to it.” Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the name of the American Psychological Association."

The effect is comparable to how shaded areas end up much cooler on a hot day than any place in direct sunlight. Saturday’s annular eclipse will block up to 90% of the sun In a narrow path from Oregon to Texas. Annular eclipses allow slightly more solar radiation – sunlight and energy – to make it to the Earth’s surface than a total eclipse, which entirely blocks the sun. But a reduction in solar radiation, no matter how brief, can affect temperatures and other weather. Not all eclipse weather changes are created equal, though. The exact drop in temperature can vary widely based on other factors like the time of year and cloud cover. An October annular eclipse is going to have a less dramatic effect on temperatures than an August total eclipse, not just because of the amount of sun blocked by the moon, but also the lower angle at which the sun strikes the Earth in fall compared to summer. A higher sun angle produces more intense sunshine and elevated temperatures, and the angle starts to drop in fall. 2017’s total solar eclipse took place during a summer afternoon in August, so temperatures were already high, making them more prone to crater in some locations along the path of totality. Temperatures fell 11 degrees over just one hour in Douglas, Wyoming, and widespread temperature drops of 4 to 8 degrees happened across the South. Temperature drops during Saturday’s eclipse are not expected to be as drastic, but could still dip a few degrees in the path of annularity. Areas only experiencing a partial solar eclipse could see a slower rise in temperatures from late morning to the early afternoon, Juan Hernandez, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, Texas, told CNN. A slower rise in temperatures could limit how far high temperatures can climb in the afternoon hours and leave Saturday a bit cooler than if there were no eclipse.  This may happen in Dallas and Phoenix, where the moon will block 80% of the sun. An eclipse affects more than just temperature. Less solar radiation and reduced temperatures can also affect wind, humidity and cloud cover. The quick cooldown during an eclipse briefly reduces the amount of heat stored in the atmosphere. Heat forces air to rise and makes the atmosphere unstable. The atmosphere then creates clouds, storms and wind to let out heat energy in an attempt to bring itself back into balance. So as the eclipse cools the air, the atmosphere calms down and wind speeds drop because the atmosphere isn’t working as hard to balance itself out. Scientists took a number of weather measurements in Wyoming and New York during 2017’s total solar eclipse and found wind speeds dropped by an average of 6 mph as a result of the eclipse. How humid it feels is tied closely to temperature. Humidity rises when the air temperature and the dew point, which measures how much moisture is in the air, approach the same temperature. So when air temperatures briefly dip during an eclipse, they trend closer to the dew point and make the air feel a bit more humid. A significant temperature drop can also alter cloud cover. Clouds over parts of South Carolina disappeared during 2017’s total solar eclipse because they lost their fuel – heat that forces air to rise and form clouds. It’s possible a few clouds could also dissipate in Saturday’s eclipse, even with less drastic temperature drops."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","Advocacy group Climate Power is committing $80 million in advertising to call attention to President Joe Biden’s climate and environment agenda ahead of the 2024 election, the group announced Monday. The ad campaign broadly aims to inform voters about the president’s wide-ranging climate and clean energy agenda. As he took office, Biden set ambitious targets to cut the country’s planet-warming emissions. He also presided over the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest legislative climate investment in US history. Yet even as Biden has directed his administration to prioritize climate change and clean energy, polling this summer shows his message isn’t getting through to voters. A July Washington Post/University of Maryland poll found that less than a third of Americans polled knew a great deal about the IRA, compared to 71% who had heard a little or nothing about it. But the same poll found respondents broadly supportive of the initiatives in the bill, including tax subsidies to defray the cost of purchasing an electric vehicle, solar panels, or energy efficient heating and cooling systems. The same poll found 57% of Americans disapproved of how Biden has handled the issue of climate change. “People overwhelmingly support what President Biden has done to combat climate change — but only if they hear about it,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power. “Our campaign plans to bridge the information gap around the clean energy plan by meeting Americans where they are and telling the story of our climate progress.” Climate Power is launching digital and television ads and plans to continue spending on both platforms heading into 2024, according to a fact sheet provided by the group. It is launching a campaign to mobilize Latino voters on the issue and focusing on digital campaigns to reach young voters on social media. The group is also organizing in-person events in key battleground states including Arizona, Georgia and Michigan. Climate Power has an ad campaign partnership with Future Forward, whose nonprofit arm helped pay for some of its spots so far this year. In addition to Climate Power’s new campaign, Biden also received the support of four environmental groups earlier this year: LCV Action Fund, NextGen PAC, the Sierra Club and the NRDC Action Fund jointly endorsed Biden in June, the first time all four groups have done so. The Biden administration has also received praise from the youth-led climate group the Sunrise Movement after moving to create the first ever American Climate Corps. But the president has also been criticized by environmental groups for green lighting some major fossil fuel projects, including the Willow Project in Alaska and the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia. CORRECTION: This headline and story have been updated to clarify the type of ads from Climate Power and to reflect that the nonprofit arm of Future Forward helped pay for some of its ads."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","Climate change-fueled wildfires are costing the US economy between $394 billion to $893 billion annually, a new congressional report suggests – a shocking figure that is more than double what previous government reports have estimated. The new report from the Joint Economic Committee, chaired by Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, examined a wide range of costs beyond immediate wildfire damage, including impacts to real estate value; premature deaths and health risks from wildfire smoke; threats to watersheds; and income loss. The report was shared first with CNN. The range Heinrich’s committee found, which was adjusted for inflation, is significantly higher than a Trump administration report that examined fewer impacts and found the annual cost for wildfires was between $87.4 and $427.8 billion. “The topline numbers are scary,” Heinrich told CNN. “Even if you live someplace where wildfire has never been an issue, these are numbers that are big enough to be systemically problematic for the economy.” Heinrich said he and his staff wanted to look at the cascading economic costs from wildfires – including effects that continue long after a fire has been extinguished – and make a case for why lawmakers and officials should spend money proactively on resilience measures. “There’s always been this frame from some policymakers that we can’t afford to do anything about climate change,” Heinrich said. “And the reality is, the real costs to our economy are to not do anything about it, and let this run away to an even worse outcome down the road.” The diminished US real estate value is by far the largest portion of the total cost. The report estimates real estate has suffered anywhere from $67.5 to $337.5 billion a year due to wildfires. In comparison, the report estimates insurance payouts for wildfire damage at $14.8 billion per year, and annual premium increases around $1.6 billion. But the figures are also uncertain because the impact on real estate markets is just starting to be understood, an outside expert said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty there, that’s fair,” said Ed Kearns, the chief data officer for nonprofit First Street Foundation, who was not involved in the report. “It’s still evolving as we speak because the insurance industry is just making these adjustments. What those ultimately will be, we’re not exactly sure how big yet.” Disaster experts are warning the US is on the precipice of larger economic implications around wildfires and real estate. In fire-prone California, home insurance prices are skyrocketing, and several insurers have stopped writing new policies, citing more destructive fires. There’s also evidence that the emerging insurance crisis is already having an impact on home prices, said David Jones, the former California insurance commissioner and director of the Climate Risk Initiative at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment. Homeowners who have had to take on a higher insurance premium may have a tougher time selling their home. Homebuyers also need to factor higher premiums into their monthly payments, reducing the amount of home they can afford – assuming they can get a policy at all. “It stands to reason that if you’re a homebuyer, you’re going to ask the question, what’s it going to cost me to insure this place, and can I get insurance?” Jones told CNN in a recent interview. If the answer is insurance is really expensive and hard to get, he added, “then homebuyers are saying, ‘I’m not going to pay as much for this house, because it’s simply not worth as much.’” Kearns agreed, saying that federally backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are starting to take notice of some insurance companies in California removing fire coverage from their policies, or not issuing new policies altogether. “It just wasn’t really on their radar; flood was the major driver of default,” Kearns said. “Fannie and Freddie have now changed their tune now that insurers are decoupling.” The congressional report also considered the impacts wildfires can have on drinking water – something not measured in the previous federal report, but an issue that has become even more critical as the West faces a drier future. In recent years, wildfires have contaminated nearby streams and rivers that supply water to communities – leaving some with the threat of running out of drinking water. As a massive wildfire scorched the northern New Mexico last year, the sludgy ash and charred soil left behind slid into the Gallinas River – threatening the drinking water supply for the city of Las Vegas, New Mexico. Staring down just weeks of fresh water left before they found an extra supply, city officials were hoping for federal grant money for an upgraded water treatment system to filter out tiny particles of contamination and make the water safe to drink. Heinrich said the watershed costs the report found were “very substantial.” “Communities like Mora and Las Vegas that have had to figure out how to provide clean drinking water to their constituents post-fire, you realize how expensive clean water really is and how infrastructure dependent it is,” Heinrich said."

Here’s what that means for snow and cold",10-19-2023,"                                                 El Niño will drive what could be a warmer or wetter winter in parts of the US this year, according to an outlook released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday.                                             ","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","El Niño will drive what could be a warmer or wetter winter in parts of the US this year, according to an outlook released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday. But don’t worry, snow lovers. El Niño – a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific – could also mean higher snow chances in some atypical spots and fuel more potent northeast snowstorms, forecasters say. El Niño is forecast to be strong this winter and reach the most significant level since a very strong El Niño fostered the warmest winter on record across the US mainland during 2015-2016, according to NOAA. While no two El Niño winters are the same, this shift typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the South while the north becomes drier and warmer. And that’s exactly what’s expected this winter. Above-average temperatures are likely across much of the northern US, according to NOAA’s outlook. Parts of the Northwest, Great Lakes and Northeast have the highest likelihood of above-average temperatures. This will be a dramatic change for parts of the Northwest after last winter ended cooler than average for the region. It’ll be yet another warm winter for the Great Lakes and Northeast. Last winter was one of the warmest on record for both regions, according to data from NOAA. When forecasters predict above-average, temperatures for an entire season it doesn’t mean there won’t be any cold, just that old bouts may be less frequent and last for shorter periods of time. Outside of an area of near-normal temperatures expected for parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas and Texas, there is not a strong signal across the rest of the US, according to NOAA. Much of the southern half of the country has equal chances of being near normal, above normal or below normal. The same cannot be said of precipitation. A large area of the southern US from the Plains through the Southeast is expected to see above-average precipitation this winter. This precipitation could fall in the form of rain, snow or an icy mix of both. More precipitation would be welcome news for some states that are battling intense drought, including Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Southern cities like Lubbock, Texas, and Little Rock, Arkansas, average less than 8 inches of snow per year, but even these minimal snow amounts climb during an El Niño winter. This southern precipitation pattern is one of El Niño’s winter signatures. El Niño tends to shift the jet stream south over the US. Because the jet stream is essentially a river of air that storms flow through, storms can then move across the South with increased frequency and increase the chances of precipitation. The mid-Atlantic and far southern New England are also likely to see more precipitation than normal this winter. El Niño typically favors a less-active, west-to-east storm track across the northern US, but the Northeast will still be prone to snowy nor’easters. During an El Niño winter, nor’easters can get “juiced up” by abundant tropical moisture and deliver “two to three big snowstorms” on average, according to Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. “With the right timing, these storms can really explode off the East Coast,” Gottschalck explained. Typically, much of the Northeast gets less snow than normal in an El Niño winter – this is true for both interior cities like Albany, New York, and coastal cities like Boston. But this winter, a majority of the region has equal chances to record near-normal, above normal or below normal precipitation. “There’s hope for snow lovers,” Gottschalck said. Drier weather is likely across other sections of the northern US, which is fairly typical for an El Niño winter. NOAA’s outlook highlights the northern Rockies and Great Lakes as the places most likely to have less precipitation than average this winter. Parts of the central and southern Rockies and the central Plains will lean wetter than average this winter. Near- or above-normal precipitation would help drought-stricken states, including Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska. Water levels on parts of the Mississippi River have plummeted to historic low levels as a result of ongoing drought, and winter is when these levels are able to recharge. A wet winter is also expected across much of California. The state was pummeled by many atmospheric river events in rapid succession last winter through early spring, which led the state to one of its wettest winters in history, according to data from NOAA."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Rapid melting of West Antarctica’s ice shelves may now be unavoidable as human-caused global warming accelerates, with potentially devastating implications for sea level rise around the world, new research has found. Even if the world meets ambitious targets to limit global heating, West Antarctica will experience substantial ocean warming and ice shelf melting, according to the new study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Ice shelves are tongues of ice that jut out into the ocean at the end of glaciers. They act like buttresses, helping hold ice back on the land, slowing its flow into the sea and providing an important defense against sea level rise. As ice shelves melt, they thin and lose their buttressing ability. While there has been growing evidence ice loss in West Antarctica may be irreversible, there has been uncertainty about how much can be prevented through climate policies. The researchers looked at “basal melting,” when warm ocean currents melt the ice from beneath. They analyzed the rate of ocean warming and ice shelf melting under different climate change scenarios. These ranged from the ambitious, where the world manages to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, to the worst-case, where humans burn large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. They found if the world limits temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which it is not on track to do, climate change could still cause the ocean to warm at three times the historical rate. Even significantly cutting planet-heating pollution now will have “limited power” to prevent warmer oceans from triggering the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, the report found. “It appears that we may have lost control of the West Antarctic ice melting over the 21st century,” said Kaitlin Naughten, an ocean modeler with the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the study. West Antarctica is already the continent’s largest contributor to global sea level rise and has enough ice to raise sea levels by an average of 5.3 meters, or more than 17 feet. It’s home to the Thwaites Glacier, also known as the “Doomsday glacier,” because its collapse could raise sea levels by several feet, forcing coastal communities and low-lying island nations to either build around sea level rise or abandon these places, Naughten said. While the study focused on ice shelf melting and did not directly quantify the impacts on sea level rise, “we have every reason to expect that sea level rise would increase as a result, as West Antarctica speeds up this loss of ice into the ocean,” Naughten said. Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved with the study, said the findings are “sobering.” They build on existing research that paints an alarming picture of what’s happening to the planet’s southernmost continent, he told CNN. “The thing that’s depressing is the committed nature of sea level rise, particularly for the next century,” Scambos told CNN. “People who are alive today are going to see a significant increase in the rate of sea level rise in all the coastal cities around the world.” The only way to really stop the rapid ice melting, Scambos said, would be not just to cut levels of planet-heating pollution but also to “remove some that has already built up.” This will be “a real challenge,” he said. Some scientists sounded a note of caution about the study. Tiago Segabinazzi Dotto, senior research scientist at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK, said it should be “treated carefully” as it is based on a single model. However, its conclusions do agree with previous research in the region, he told the Science Media Center, giving “confidence that this study needs to be taken in consideration for policymakers.” Naughten and her colleagues acknowledged their study has limits — predicting future rates of melting in West Antarctica is very complex and it’s impossible to account for every possible future outcome. But, looking at the range of scenarios, the report authors said they were confident the melting of ice shelves is now unavoidable. “The question of doom and gloom is something I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about with this study, because how do you tell such a bad news story?” Naughten said. “Conventional wisdom is supposed to give people hope, and I don’t see a lot of hope in this story,” she added, “but it’s what the science tells me and it’s what I have to communicate to the world.” West Antarctic ice shelf melting is one impact of climate change “we are probably just going to have to adapt to and that very likely means some amount of sea level rise we cannot avoid,” Naughten said. But although the outlook is dire, humanity cannot give up on slashing fossil fuel emissions, Naughten said. Devastating impacts can still be avoided in other parts of Antarctica and the rest of the world, she noted."

Reclaiming arid land and turning it back into agricultural fields could be key to ensuring we are able to feed the planet’s population. Sand to Green is a Moroccan startup that can transform a patch of desert into a sustainable and profitable plantation in five years, according to Wissal Ben Moussa, its co-founder and chief agricultural officer. “Desertification is the future of a lot of countries today,” she says. “Our solution is using agroforestry to create a new kind of agriculture that is sustainable and that can be resilient in front of climate change.” The system can be deployed anywhere near a source of brackish water, which Sand to Green desalinates using solar-powered technology. It then plants a variety of fruit-producing trees and herbs in the same space — a practice known as intercropping — and drip-irrigates their roots directly with the desalinated water, to minimize evaporation. The soil is regenerated using what Sand to Green calls “green manure,” a mixture that includes compost, biochar and microorganisms that help the soil “wake up,” according to Ben Moussa. Biochar is a form of charcoal that can help arid soils retain water. This allows some herbs to be ready for harvest after just two years. In a five-hectare trial in southern Morocco that’s been running since 2017, Sand to Green has tried out a variety of plants in search of the best perfomers. “My top three favorite trees are carob, fig and pomegranate,” Ben Moussa says. “They are endemic to the regions where we want to deploy, have high added value when it comes to the produce, but they are also very resilient.” Among the intercropping herbs that have been successfully trialed are rosemary, geranium, vetiver and citronella, which Ben Moussa describes as “very low-maintenance and very high-margin.” A 2018 review by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification found that the global economy was set to lose $23 trillion by 2050 because of land degradation, while taking urgent action would cost only a fraction of that — $4.6 trillion. Land degradation or drought affect 169 countries, with Asia and Africa the hardest-hit. Efforts to grow crops in desert environments are spreading. The International Center for Biosaline Agriculture is growing salt-tolerant superfoods in the sandy soil of Dubai, while in Tanzania, non-profits are using mounds of earth known as bunds to trap water so that it can penetrate parched ground, allowing grasses to return. Sand to Green is now working to scale up to a 20-hectare commercial proof-of-concept site, also in southern Morocco. It says a site of that size would cost around €450,000 ($475,000) to set up and would start bringing financial returns in about five years. “With this system we create biodiversity, which means better soil, healthier crops and a bigger yield,” Ben Moussa says. “Our plantation can generate 1.5 times more yield and thus more revenue than a monoculture plantation in the same area.” When commercialized, each piece of land will be divided into plantations that will be provided as a “green investment,” Ben Moussa says, with Sand to Green handling every step from inception to fruition. Revenues will be shared between the investors and Sand to Green. Earlier this year, the company raised $1 million in seed funding, and there are plans for an additional, 500-hectare project, again in Morocco. Sand to Green says its techniques could be used in countries including Mauritania, Senegal, Namibia, Egypt, in the Arabian peninsula, some parts of the United States, and on the Mexican coast. “We can go anywhere in the world as long as we have access to brackish water,” Ben Moussa says. “The good news is that there is a lot of it along coastal areas.”"

","Anna Cooban, CNN","Global demand for oil, natural gas and coal — and the carbon pollution they generate — are expected to peak later this decade, according to a new report by the International Energy Agency. Driving the shift will be the “phenomenal rise” of clean sources of energy, the Paris-based agency said in its annual World Energy Outlook report, published Tuesday. The agency said it expects there to be nearly 10 times as many electric cars on the road globally by the end of the decade, and for renewables to account for almost half of the global energy mix, up from 30% today. Slowing growth in China will also depress demand for fossil fuels. The world’s second biggest economy — and largest energy consumer — has reached an “inflection point,” the IEA said, with its total energy demand set to peak around the middle of the decade. China is also becoming a “clean energy powerhouse,” and accounted for more than half of electric vehicle sales worldwide last year. “The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and it’s unstoppable. It’s not a question of ‘if’, it’s just a matter of ‘how soon’ — and the sooner the better for all of us,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement. The IEA report challenges calls by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) — a group of the world’s major oil producing nations — for trillions of dollars of new investment into the sector between now and 2045 to prevent a spike in energy prices. And it stands in sharp contrast to moves in recent days by America’s biggest oil and gas companies — ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) — to double down on the future of US shale production by acquiring smaller rivals Pioneer (PXD) and Hess (HES) in deals valued at $60 billion and $53 billion respectively. “The end of the growth era for fossil fuels does not mean an end to fossil fuel investment, but it undercuts the rationale for any increase in spending,” the agency said in its report. In the near term, oil prices could be driven much higher by the war triggered by the brutal attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has gained nearly 7% since then. Birol said that the conflict could rock oil markets, 50 years after the world was plunged into an energy crisis by an Arab oil embargo triggered by the 1973 Yom Kippur war. “We are today facing a major geopolitical crisis in the Middle East that could shock oil markets once again and deeply, because many oil producing countries are in that region,” Birol told reporters. “This comes on top of the insecurity that we had in the natural gas markets… after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,” he added. Despite the accelerating shift to renewables, and lasting changes to consumption patterns in countries such as China, the IEA — which monitors energy trends for the world’s richest economies — warned that more needed to be done if the world is to stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “Based on today’s policy settings, global emissions would remain high enough to push up global average temperatures by around 2.4 degrees Celsius this century,” it said. Scientists consider warming of 1.5 degrees a threshold beyond which extreme heat, floods, droughts, wildfires, and food and water shortages will have an even greater impact on life as we know it. This year’s summer in the Northern Hemisphere was the world’s hottest on record, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service."

The team surveyed 8,842 US adults online from Sept. 25 to Oct. 1. After a summer of extreme weather – like the deadly Southwestern heat wave and devastating Vermont floods – Tyson’s team wanted to examine whether the impacts were making an impression on the American public. “What we wanted to do with this survey was to focus more on the perceived personal impacts to the country and folks’ own lives,” Tyson said, calling it Pew’s “most dedicated effort” to-date focusing on “what people think is going to happen in their own lives” when it comes to climate change. Pew found nearly half of Americans expect to have to make minor sacrifices over the course of their lifetimes due to climate impacts, while around a quarter of Americans think they’ll have to make major sacrifices. Another 28% expect to make no sacrifices at all due to climate change. Tyson told CNN the Pew team didn’t specify what kinds of sacrifices qualified as major or minor. The Pew survey found deep partisan divisions impact people’s perceptions of climate change; for instance, 86% of Democrats expect negative climate impacts to get worse during their lifetime, while just 37% of Republicans said the same. “Nothing matters more than partisanship,” Tyson noted, adding that factors like age and geographical location weren’t as strong as partisan divides in influencing opinions on climate change. “Democrats foresee much greater negative impacts from climate (change) over the coming decade, Republicans not so much.” Tyson and the team at Pew found that where people lived and what age they are also impacts how they view climate change. For instance, a majority of those polled nationally said they expected that coastal Florida, Southern California and the Southwest will become worse places to live over the next 30 years due to the effects of climate change. About half of adults polled who live in the Western US said they expect climate change will make conditions in their region worse, compared to just 30% of Midwestern residents who said the same. “Climate experts talk about how impacts may be more severe in some places than others; that concept seems to resonate with the public,” Tyson said. “That’s quite striking.”"

When it happens right before landfall, as it did with Otis, it can catch coastal communities by surprise with little time to prepare. The hurricane’s intensification was among the fastest forecasters have ever seen: its top-end windspeed increased by 115 mph in 24 hours. Only one other storm, Hurricane Patricia in 2015, exceeded Otis’ rapid intensification in East Pacific records, with a 120-mph increase in 24 hours. The term rapid intensification refers to when a storm’s winds strengthen rapidly over a short amount of time. Scientists have defined it as a wind speed increase of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less, and it generally requires significant ocean heat. The National Hurricane Center said Otis strengthened so fast on Tuesday that it had “explosively intensified.” Otis “took full advantage of a warm patch of ocean” that was roughly 88 degrees Fahrenheit, said Brian McNoldy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami – more than enough ocean heat to fuel a monster storm. More than 90% of warming around the globe over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, an El Niño is growing in the Pacific this year, driving ocean temperatures even higher. Otis’ strengthening “was extremely unusual,” McNoldy told CNN. “It’s unfortunate it happened right before making landfall, but if this had occurred over the open ocean, it still would have been very remarkable.” Tropical storms usually take several days to grow into powerful hurricanes, but with human-caused climate change, rapid intensification is becoming a more common occurrence, said Suzana Camargo, hurricane expert and professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “It’s very rare for intense storms to make landfall in Mexico’s eastern Pacific side,” Camargo told CNN. Only one hurricane, Category 1 Hurricane Max in 2017, has made landfall within 50 miles of Acapulco, according to a CNN analysis of NOAA data. “But we have an El Niño year, which makes the eastern north Pacific Ocean more active than normal, and on top of that you have anthropogenic climate change,” Camargo said. The alarming rapid intensification trend has also been reported in the Atlantic. A recent study found that Atlantic hurricanes may now be more than twice as likely to strengthen from a weak Category 1 storm to a major Category 3 in a 24-hour period than they were between 1970 and 1990. A 2019 study found that between the 1980s and early 200s, Atlantic hurricanes showed a “highly unusual” increase in rapid intensification – a trend the report said could only be explained by human-caused climate change. And, concerningly, scientists found significant intensification was happening to the strongest storms, making the most life-threatening hurricanes even more dangerous. Rapid intensification has been historically hard to predict, but with climate change making oceans warmer, scientists are confident it is a phenomenon that will occur more often. “All of this is just confirming what we expected,” Camargo said."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Glaciers in East Antarctica could lose ice faster in the future than previously thought, scientists reported Friday, in an alarming feedback loop where glacier meltwater is triggering even more ice loss and sea level rise as the planet warms. The findings come less than a week after scientists reported rapid melting of West Antarctica’s ice shelves may now be unavoidable, thanks to human-caused global warming. Together, these and other recent studies paint a dire picture of a melting southern continent that poses extreme risk of life-altering sea level rise around the world. “This paper shows that it’s not only bad, but it’s even worse than we thought,” said Jamin Greenbaum, co-author of the study and assistant research geophysicist at the University of California San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, focused on the Denman and Scott glaciers in East Antarctica that together hold enough ice to trigger roughly five feet of sea level rise. Previous studies have shown that as glaciers melt, the water flows underneath them and out to sea – a process that enhances glacial melting and ice loss. Friday’s study factored that feedback into simulations to see how much it could accelerate Antarctic melting and sea level rise. Scientists found the glaciers could retreat past a critical threshold about 25 years earlier than they would have without the meltwater discharge, if the world burns planet-warming fossil fuel at an accelerated rate. Adding the meltwater feedback increased the sea level rise from the Denman and Scott glaciers by nearly 16% by the end of 2300 under this scenario of high levels of planet-heating pollution. Importantly, Greenbaum said, the extra ice loss from meltwater discharge is currently excluded from climate models projecting sea level rise, despite the fact that it could be a major driver of ice loss across the whole continent. Measuring this phenomenon and accounting for it in climate models is necessary “to get a realistic picture of global sea level rise,” Greenbaum said. Tyler Pelle, lead author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at Scripps, said people need to pay attention to this part of the world as East Antarctica becomes more unstable, posing a higher risk of sea level rise for coastal communities and low-lying island nations. “These are huge ice masses that we previously thought were stable, and now we have all of this evidence from coastal observations showing that these glaciers have been in patterns of retreat for quite a long time now,” Pelle told CNN. “That makes it very worth the attention.” People’s lives are at stake, researchers say. While people alive today may not experience the devastating impacts from this melting, Pelle said the actions taken today seal the fate of future generations. “What we emit now is going to be impacting climate for generations to come,” Pelle said. “What we do today does have an impact on what the Earth is going to look like in 2100 or 2300, even if we’re not on this Earth anymore.” Jan De Rydt, associate professor of polar glaciology and oceanography at Northumbria University, who was not involved with the study, said the researchers make “a strong argument” for why subglacial discharge needs to be accounted for in all simulations of Antarctic ice loss. “Given this evidence, subglacial melt and discharge is a process that can no longer be ignored in future projections of Antarctica’s contribution to sea level rise,” De Rydt told CNN. While the researchers only used a present-day simulation for the study, which led to conservative results, Greenbaum said they plan to go back on the field to analyze the depths of the ice sheet and the ocean to truly understand what the future holds. “The least-explored part of Antarctica is the most important to observing and monitoring,” he said. “That’s a huge problem, that’s like yell it from rooftops, and it’s something that our group is really focused on.”"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","When tw﻿o scientists went looking for fossil fuels beneath the ground of northeastern France, they did not expect to discover something which could supercharge the effort to tackle the climate crisis. Jacques Pironon and Phillipe De Donato, both directors of research at France’s National Centre of Scientific Research, were assessing the amount of methane in the subsoils of the Lorraine mining basin using a “world first” specialized probe, able to analyze gases dissolved in the water of rock formations deep underground. A couple of hundred meters down, the probe found low concentrations of hydrogen. “This was not a real surprise for us,” Pironon told CNN; it’s common to find small amounts near the surface of a borehole. But as the probe went deeper, the concentration ticked up. At 1,100 meters down it was 14%, at 1,250 meters it was 20%. This was surprising, Pironon said. It indicated the presence of a large reservoir of hydrogen beneath. They ran calculations and estimated the deposit could contain between 6 million and 250 million metric tons﻿ of hydrogen. That could make it one of the largest deposits of “white hydrogen” ever discovered, Pironon said. The find has helped fuel an already feverish interest in the gas. White hydrogen – also referred to as “natural,” “gold” or “geologic” hydrogen – is naturally produced or present in the Earth’s crust and has become something of a climate holy grail. Hydrogen produces only water when burned, making it very attractive as a potential clean energy source for industries like aviation, shipping and steel-making that need so much energy it’s almost impossible to meet through renewables such as solar and wind. But while hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it generally exists combined with other molecules. Currently, commercial hydrogen is produced in an energy-intensive process almost entirely powered by fossil fuels. A rainbow of colors is used as a shorthand for the different types of hydrogen. “Gray” is made from methane gas and “brown” from coal. “Blue” hydrogen is the same as gray, but the planet-heating pollution produced is captured before it goes into the atmosphere. The most promising from a climate perspective is “green” hydrogen, made using renewable energy to split water. Yet production remains small scale and expensive. That’s why interest in white hydrogen, a potentially abundant, untapped source of clean-burning energy, has ratcheted up over the last few years. “If you had asked me four years ago what I thought about natural hydrogen, I would have told you ‘oh, it doesn’t exist,’” said Geoffrey Ellis, a geochemist with the US Geological Survey. “Hydrogen’s out there, we know it’s around,” he said, but scientists thought big accumulations weren’t possible. Then he found out about Mali. Arguably, the catalyst for the current interest in white hydrogen can be traced to this West African country. In 1987, in the village of Bourakébougou, a driller was left with burns after a water well unexpectedly exploded as he leaned over the edge of it while smoking a cigarette. The well was swiftly plugged and abandoned until 2011, when it was unplugged by an oil and gas company and reportedly found to be producing a gas that was 98% hydrogen. The hydrogen was used to power the village, and more than a decade later, it is still producing. When a study came out about the well in 2018, it caught the attention of the science community, including Ellis. His initial reaction was that there had to be something wrong with the research, “because we just know that this can’t happen.” Then the pandemic hit and he had time on his hands to start digging. The more he read, the more he realized “we just haven’t been looking for it, we haven’t been looking in the right places.” The recent discoveries are exciting for Ellis, who has been working as a petroleum geochemist since the 1980s. He witnessed the rapid growth of the shale gas industry in the US, which revolutionized the energy market. “Now,” he said, “here we are in what I think is probably a second revolution.” White hydrogen is “very promising,” agreed Isabelle Moretti, a scientific researcher at the University of Pau et des Pays de l’Adour and the University of Sorbonne and a white hydrogen expert. “Now the question is no longer about the resource… but where to find large economic reserves,” she told CNN. Dozens of processes generate white hydrogen but there is still some uncertainty about how large natural deposits form. Geologists have tended to focus on “serpentinization,” where water reacts with iron-rich rocks to produce hydrogen, and “radiolysis,” a radiation-driven breakdown of water molecules. White hydrogen deposits have been found throughout the world, including in the US, eastern Europe, Russia, Australia, Oman, as well as France and Mali. Some have been discovered by accident, others by hunting for clues like features in the landscapes sometimes referred to as “fairy circles” – shallow, elliptical depressions that can leak hydrogen. Ellis estimates globally there could be tens of billions of tons of white hydrogen. This would be vastly more than the 100 million tons a year of hydrogen that is currently produced and the 500 million tons predicted to be produced annually by 2050, he said. “Most of this is almost certainly going to be in very small accumulations or very far offshore, or just too deep to actually be economic to produce,” he said. But if just 1% can be found and produced, it would provide 500 million tons of hydrogen for 200 years, he added. It’s a tantalizing prospect for a slew of startups. Australia-based Gold Hydrogen is currently drilling in the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. It targeted that spot after scouring the state’s archives and discovering that back in the 1920s, a number of boreholes had been drilled there which had very high concentrations of hydrogen. The prospectors, only interested in fossil fuels, abandoned them. “We’re very excited by what we’re seeing,” said managing director Neil McDonald. There is more testing and drilling to do but the company could get into early production possibly in late 2024, he told CNN. Some startups are seeing eye-popping investments. Koloma, a Denver-based white hydrogen start-up, has secured $91 million from investors, including the Bill Gates-founded investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures – although the company remains tight-lipped about exactly where in the US it is drilling and when it is aiming for commercialization. Another Denver-based company, Natural Hydrogen Energy, founded by geochemist Viacheslav Zgonnik, has completed an exploratory hydrogen borehole in Nebraska in 2019 and has plans for new wells. The world is “very close to the first commercial projects,” Zgonnik told CNN. “Natural hydrogen is a solution which will allow us to get get to speed” on climate action, he said. The challenge for these businesses and for scientists will be translating hypothetical promise into a commercial reality. “There could be a period of decades where there’s a lot of trial and error and false starts,” Ellis said. But speed is vital. “If it’s going to take us 200 years to develop the resource, that’s not really going to be of much use.” But many of the startups are bullish. Some predict years, not decades, to commercialization. “We have all necessary technology we need, with some slight modifications,” Zgonnik said. Challenges remain. In some countries, regulations are an obstacle. Costs also need to be worked out. According to calculations based on the Mali well, white hydrogen could cost around $1 a kilogram to produce – compared to around $6 a kilogram for green hydrogen. But white hydrogen could quickly become more expensive if large deposits require deeper drilling. Back in the Lorraine basin, Pironon and De Donato’s next steps are to drill down to 3,000 meters to get a clearer idea of exactly how much white hydrogen there is. There’s a long way to go, but it would be ironic if this region – once one of western Europe’s key coal producers – became an epicenter of a new white hydrogen industry."

Those days of extreme heat were associated with nearly 1,700 excess cardiovascular deaths each year, according to a study published Monday in the journal Circulation. If fossil-fuel development continues to expand globally and the world only makes minimal efforts to reduce planet-warming pollution, there could be 80 days of extreme heat each summer and the number of heat-related cardiovascular deaths in the US could more than triple – to about 5,500 excess deaths per year, the researchers found. Even a more plausible scenario, where planned and ongoing climate change mitigation measures are put into place, could lead to a jump to 71 days of extreme heat per year and a 2.6 times increase in heart-related mortality – with more than 4,300 excess cardiovascular deaths related to excess heat by the middle of the century. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US overall and extreme heat causes a small share of total cardiovascular deaths in the US — about 1 in 500 right now, said Dr. Lawrence Fine, a senior adviser at the National Institutes of Health’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, which partially funded the new research. But as hot days become more common, risk mitigation becomes more important, he said. “The thing about heat-related deaths is that they’re concentrated to when it’s very hot, and they’re also concentrated in people who are at greater risk because of their health conditions or other conditions,” he said. A heat wave can strain emergency rooms and the broader health care system and pose a severe threat to certain individuals. “It’s important to address the root causes of the increase in temperature and heart disease, but we also want people to know if they’re vulnerable and to have a specific plan for what to do when they find themselves in a very hot environment.” The new study’s findings are based on projections about population growth and migration in the US, as well as trends in greenhouse gas emissions from a report by the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The analysis captured projections for the years 2036 through 2065, based on county-level data for the 48 states in the contiguous US. This summer was an alarming example of how dangerous extreme heat can be. Officials in Maricopa County, Arizona, reported last week that 469 people there have died of heat-associated illness this year, with more than 150 deaths still under investigation, making 2023 the deadliest year for heat deaths since the county began tracking them in 2006. Many of those deaths came as temperatures soared to record-breaking levels in the Southwest this summer, and Phoenix logged 31 consecutive days at or above 110 degrees Fahrenheit from June into July. Heat-related fatalities have risen dramatically in the US in recent years. In 2022, more than 1,700 deaths were due to heat-related causes, according to an analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – more than doubling over the past five years. And that data is likely an underestimate, experts say, because extreme heat exposure isn’t always well documented. The heart is particularly susceptible to the effects of heat. The human body can only operate within a narrow temperature range, and the heart plays a critical role in keeping the system regulated, said Dr. Sameed Khatana, an assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine at Penn Medicine and senior author of the new study. When the heart has to work harder than it’s used to, the consequen﻿ces can be deadly for some. “When the body senses that its temperature is going up, various things start kicking into gear. A key component of that is that the heart beats faster and harder to get blood away from the core of the body, to transport heat away from the vital organs,” he said. “For people with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, their heart might not be able to keep up with the increased demands on the cardiovascular system that temperature is causing.” Longer exposures to heat can also lead to more complex changes such as increased inflammation and blood clotting that can raise the risk for heart attack and stroke, he said. Black adults in the US are particularly vulnerable to the heart-related harms of extreme heat. Over the next few decades, heat-related cardiovascular deaths could grow six-fold among Black adults in the US, according to the scenarios analyzed in the study – compared with a projected 2.4 times increase among White adults in the worst-case scenario. Seniors age 65 and older and adults living in metropolitan areas are also projected to be disproportionately af﻿fected. Demographic shifts in the US – such as an aging population, diversification and growth in cities – could exacerbate baseline vulnerabilities. “In some ways, you could argue that no one should be dying due to heat exposure. There is a simple solution: you just get someone to a cool environment,” Khatana said. “But like most public health issues in the United States, the health impacts of climate change – and extreme heat, specifically – are also health equity issues.” People who are vulnerable to heat exposure are likely vulnerable in many other aspects of their lives – perhaps living in areas with less tree cover or without access to air conditioning. Black people are also more likely to live with conditions that put their heart health at risk, including higher rates of hypertension and diabetes. “Solutions need to be targeted at people who are the most vulnerable,” Khatana said. “If mitigation efforts are not taken, if efforts to reduce emissions aren’t made, then these inequities that we’ve already seen might continue to widen.”"

CNN understood at the time that, following consultations with the government, it was jointly agreed that the climate summit wasn’t the right occasion for the King’s first trip overseas as sovereign. Few world leaders have confirmed their attendance at the talks. It is not yet clear whether US President Joe Biden will travel to the United Arab Emirates for the event. The 74-year-old King will give his address on December 1, and also meet with regional leaders, the palace said. His visit comes at a time of high tensions in the Middle East, as the Israel-Gaza war threatens to spill over to other countries. “The King will attend the Opening Ceremony of the World Climate Action Summit at COP28 UAE, at the invitation of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and at the request of His Majesty’s Government, on Friday 1st December 2023,” the statement from the palace added. During his visit to the UAE, Charles will also attend a reception to launch the inaugural COP28 Business and Philanthropy Climate Forum — a two-day event running alongside the UN summit. It will be hosted by the COP28 presidency in strategic partnership with Charles’ Sustainable Markets Initiative, which he set up while still Prince of Wales. The high-level forum aims to bring together world leaders and figures from the worlds of business, finance and philanthropy to drive forward climate and nature solutions and results. King Charles III has been a passionate advocate of environmental and climate causes for at least five decades. He attended the COP26 climate talks as Prince of Wales in 2021, which was held in Glasgow, Scotland, where he urged countries to work with industry to create climate crisis solutions. He gave a speech there in which he said the world must go on a “war-like footing” to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. Last year, after confirming he would not attend COP27, the King instead convened business leaders, experts and NGOs for a pre-COP reception at Buckingham Palace in London. He ultimately traveled to Germany and France for his first state visits as monarch. He was also a prominent backer of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord and discussed the importance of the agreement with President Donald Trump in December 2019, as the US leader prepared to pull his country from the pact."

While this kind of pollution is a serious health hazard, it also has a cooling effect, as particles reflect sunlight away from the Earth. The imbalance is set to cause accelerated global warming, bringing disastrous consequences, according to the paper, including rapid sea level rise and the potential shutdown of vital ocean currents within this century. Hansen said he is particularly concerned about the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet and especially the Thwaites Glacier, which acts as a cork, holding back the ice on land and providing an important defense against catastrophic sea level rise. But the warming is not necessarily locked in, according to the paper, which calls for “extraordinary actions.” Measures it recommends include taxing carbon pollution, increasing nuclear power to “complement renewable energies” and strong action from developed countries to help developing countries move to low carbon energy. While the highest priority is to drastically reduce planet-heating pollution, this alone will not be enough, the report found. “If we’re going to keep sea level close to where it is, we actually have to cool the planet,” said Hansen. One way to do this, the report suggests, is solar geoengineering. This controversial technology aims to cool temperatures by reflecting sunlight away from the Earth, or allowing more heat to escape into space. That can be done through injecting aerosols into the atmosphere or spraying clouds with salt particles to make them more reflective, for example. Critics warn of unforeseen consequences, including impacts on rainfall and monsoons, as well as “termination shock” if geoengineering were suddenly halted and pent-up warming released. But Hansen said it should be considered. “Rather than describe those efforts as ‘threatening geoengineering,’ we have to recognize that we are geoengineering the planet right now,” he said, by burning large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. The paper’s findings are alarming and come as the world is experiencing unprecedented heat. This year is on course to be the hottest on record, with every month from June onwards breaking records for the hottest such month. But while science is clear that the rate of global warming is increasing, the idea that it is accelerating beyond what models predict is controversial. The findings “are very much out of the mainstream,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. While the Earth’s surface and its oceans are warming, the data does not support claims that the rate is accelerating, he told CNN in an email. “As I like to say, the truth is bad enough!” Mann said. “There is no evidence that the models are under-predicting human-caused warming.” He also cast doubt on the role of pollution reduction in warming trends, saying the total impact is very small, and warned that solar geoengineering is “unprecedented” and “potentially very dangerous.” “Whether or not the 1.5 degrees Celsius target is reachable is a matter of policy, not climate physics, at this point,” Mann said. But Hansen rejected criticisms of the research, saying it’s based on hard numbers and straightforward physics. “This is not fringe, this is the correct physics and it is the real world,” he said, “and it sometimes takes the community a while to catch on.”"

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Measures to adapt to climate change in the developing world are slowing on all fronts even as the impacts of the crisis are accelerating, creating a widening gap that leaves billions of people increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat, worsening storms and sea level rise, a UN report published Thursday shows. The estimated costs to fully prepare low-income nations for the worst effects of a rapidly heating planet are now 10 to 18 times greater than the amount of money that is currently flowing to these regions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme’s annual “adaptation gap” report. That’s a more than 50% larger gap than UNEP had estimated in its 2022 report. The developed world agreed more than a decade ago to transfer at least $100 billion a year to developing countries to help both with their green transitions and efforts to adapt to the climate crisis. That pledge was reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris Agreement, but the target has never been met. Poorer nations have also complained that too little of the $100 billion is devoted to so-called adaptation — preparing for the worsening harms of the climate crisis, including deadly heat, flooding, storms, wildfires and rising oceans. The flow of adaptation finance declined by 15% to $21 billion in 2021 – the most recent year UNEP has data for – though its authors noted the Covid pandemic may have deflated climate finance spending that year. UNEP estimates the actual need is between $194 billion and $366 billion a year, and is projected to rise dramatically by 2050 as the planet warms. “The urgency is becoming very clear,” Andrea Hinwood, UNEP’s chief scientist, told CNN. “The advice we have is that in the next eight years, we need to be working as hard and fast as we can to do as much as we can to prepare us for the out-years, where some of the challenges we’re facing are going to be harder.” Unless the gap between what’s needed and what’s provided is closed, the world will more rapidly reach the threshold where people can no longer adapt to their changing climate, according to the report. The issue — as well as who should pay for the loss and damage created by the climate crisis — is expected to be a key sticking point in climate negotiations at the COP28 talks in Dubai this December. “In the next talks, there has to be a discussion about some new goals for adaptation,” Hinwood said, “but also perhaps a renewed commitment in terms of the funding and the finance that should be flowing to adaptation in developing countries.” Developed nations bear a greater historical responsibility for the human-induced climate crisis, but developing nations and small-island states are suffering the worst impacts. A recent study showed that 55 of the world’s most vulnerable economies have already experienced losses and damages of more than $500 billion in the last two decades from the climate crisis. “If we don’t fund adaptation, we then get ourselves into a situation where we can no longer adapt,” Hinwood said. “Developed countries who are still emitting greenhouse gases per capita levels that are massively more than developing countries need to show leadership here. Whatever efforts we put in place now will pay back down the track.” The report shows that the world can still prevent the mounting economic toll climate disasters could bring. Every billion dollars invested in infrastructure to protect people from coastal flooding could save $14 billion in economic damages, according to the report. And for every $16 billion invested in agriculture each year, 78 million people could be alleviated from climate crisis related starvation or chronic hunger."

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","As the US gears up for a winter heavily influenced by the first strong El Niño in years, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have released maps that offer insight into where snow could pile up. El Niño – a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific – is forecast to reach the most significant level since a very strong El Niño in 2015-2016 fostered the warmest winter on record across the contiguous US, according to NOAA. While no two El Niño winters are the same, the pattern typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the southern US while the north becomes drier and warmer. And that’s exactly what’s expected this winter. However, wetter weather doesn’t necessarily mean more snow. And when it does snow, amounts can vary wildly from one location to the next. Read More: Forecasters predict a classic El Niño winter this year This is where the new maps come in. They show where snow is more or less likely during El Niño winters compared to average. There’s just one caveat: these maps are historical guidebooks, not forecasts, for how the season’s snow could play out. An actual snowfall forecast would account for a variety of atmospheric and climatological factors, not just El Niño. “El Niño nudges the odds in favor of certain climate outcomes, but never ensures them,” Michelle L’Heureux, one of the two scientists behind the new maps, explained in a NOAA blog post. The map above depicts how much snow differs from average across all El Niño winters, regardless of El Niño’s strength. The drier trend that’s typical across the northern US shows up well in the tan and brown shading, while the wetter, snowier trend across the southern US appears in the blue shading. This pattern comes from the jet stream’s shift south, pushing storms across the southern tier of the country at the expense of the north. And an increase in storms during the winter means snow is more likely. The stronger an El Niño is, the more amplified its impact becomes. The map below shows the same data for stronger El Niño winters. The pronounced darker hues represent more extreme shifts in snowfall during a strong El Niño compared to an average one. The big snow winners are the mid-Atlantic, the high elevations of the Southwest and California, and the South, albeit with an important caveat. It still needs to be cold in order to snow, so chances don’t vary as much from normal in portions of Texas and the Southeast, which tend to remain too warm for flakes to fly. El Niño’s jet stream effect is particularly noticeable in the highest terrain of the West, where cold and snow isn’t usually hard to come by. Mountains in the Southwest and California thrive while the Northwest misses out because of fewer storms. Storms that affect the mid-Atlantic’s snow chances typically take a track along the spine of the Appalachians or push off the coast and become nor’easters. These nor’easters can get “juiced up” by abundant tropical moisture during El Niño and deliver “two to three big snowstorms” on average, according to Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. This could bring above-average snowfall to places like Washington, DC, and Baltimore, where less than an inch fell last winter. Even though the Northeast typically misses out on snow during a strong El Niño winter, all it takes is one massive storm, like a “juiced up” nor’easter, to skew snow totals for the whole season. Snow lovers in the Northwest and Midwest will also have to join their Northeast counterparts in hoping for a big storm. Stronger El Niños have caused less snow than average in the past. Removing snowfall totals from the map and focusing on the number of stronger El Niños with below-average snowfall helps suss out outlier storms. On the map above, darker reds indicate areas that have experienced more years of below-average snowfall during moderate-to-strong El Niño winters. Parts of the typically snowy Midwest and Northeast which also suffer from snowfall deficits jump out clearly, a sign that this may be where El Niño steals the most snow, most often."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","At the top of the world, northern Greenland’s huge glaciers — long thought to be relatively stable — are in trouble, a new study shows. As the ocean warms, Greenland’s last remaining ice shelves are rapidly weakening, destabilizing the nearby glaciers and threatening potentially “dramatic” consequences for sea level rise, according to the study published Tuesday in Nature Communications. Ice shelves are tongues of floating ice that jut out over the ocean and act as dams that hold back glaciers on land and slow ice loss. When they melt and weaken, more of the land-based ice is able to slide into the ocean, adding to sea level rise. Scientists analyzed eight ice shelves buttressing glaciers in northern Greenland, which together hold enough ice to raise sea levels by 2.1 meters — nearly 7 feet — should they break down and melt completely. “These glaciers are among the most important of the ice sheet,” Romain Millan, a glaciologist at the Grenoble Alpes University in France and an author of the study, told CNN. “They are the largest glaciers of Greenland.” While glaciers in other parts of Greenland started to lose mass in the 1980s and 1990s, he said, so far, those in northern Greenland “have remained relatively stable.” But this appears to no longer be the case, according to the study. Millan and his co-authors used thousands of satellite images, along with climate models and measurements from the field, to better understand the drivers for — and timing of — historical and current changes to the ice shelves. They found a “substantial and widespread” increase in ice shelf losses. Since 1978, the ice shelves supporting northern Greenland’s glaciers have lost more than 35% of their total volume, according to the study. It found that since the early 2000s, three have collapsed completely, and the remaining five are melting and destabilizing nearby glaciers. “We can see that the ice shelves are weakening,” Millan said, “and that’s new key information that we didn’t know, because we thought that this part of Greenland was really stable.” The ice loss came from a mixture of factors, the study found, including increased calving — chunks of ice breaking off to form icebergs — and surface melting. But the predominant driver was basal melting, where warm ocean currents melt the ice from beneath. Between 2000 and 2020, a “widespread increase” in the rate of basal melting closely followed a rise in ocean temperature, the study found. The scientists noted a direct impact on glaciers. As the ice shelves melt, the “grounding lines” — the point at which the glacier stops touching the ground and starts to float — are retreating, the study found. “These natural boundaries are really the key parameter that indicates the glacier stability,” Millan said. As the grounding line retreats, he added, “the ice discharge into the ocean also starts to increase.” If the oceans continue to warm, it could permanently weaken the ice shelves, Millan said. “And in a certain timescale, they could even collapse, which could have significant consequences on the contribution of the Greenland ice sheet to sea level rise.” The region already plays a large role. Between 2006 and 2018, the melting of Greenland’s ice sheet contributed to more than 17% of observed sea level rise, according to the report. It is not possible to give timescales for when such a collapse could happen, Millan said, but changes have happened fast since the early 2000s. After the collapse of the Zachariæ Isstrøm glacier’s ice shelf in 2003, the ice discharge into the ocean doubled, according to the study. Millan said when he visited the glacier in 2016 and 2017, the changes were alarming. He described it as “a chaos of tabular icebergs.” The future of the glaciers will depend heavily on what the world does to reduce planet-heating pollution, Millan said. The report calls for continued monitoring to better asses how the ice shelves will respond to climate change and, in particular, to build on the study’s findings about the complex process of basal melting and the potential impacts on sea level rise. “This will ultimately provide insight into the future of these glaciers as well as the fate of larger ice shelves in Antarctica,” the report notes. A recent study in Antarctica found that the rapid melting of the continent’s ice shelves may now be “unavoidable” due to melting from below. Sophie Nowicki, an ice sheet expert in the geology department at the University at Buffalo, who was not involved in the research, said the study’s findings are significant because of the insight they provide into sources and triggers of changes to Greenland’s ice sheet. “What is new is the ‘long-term’ record and holistic view of ice shelf evolution,” she told CNN. “​​We knew that ice shelf basal melting is related to ocean temperature, but what is neat about this study is that it gives a better idea about the timing and magnitude of the change.” The study also adds to an overall understanding of how polar regions are responding to the human-induced climate crisis, Nowicki said. The poles were once seen as “fairly boring,” she said, but since scientists began to observe them with satellites around four decades ago, it has become clear that “these are dynamic, very fragile regions.” As the planet continues to heat up, she added, “we should be concerned by how fast the changes are happening, but we should not be surprised.”"

",Reuters,"Global fossil fuel production in 2030 is set to be more than double the levels that are deemed consistent with meeting climate goals set under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the United Nations and researchers said on Wednesday. The United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) report, assessing the gap in fossil fuel production cuts and what’s needed to meet climate goals, comes ahead of the global COP 28 climate meeting, which starts on November 30 in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates. “Fossil fuel phase out is one of the pivotal issues that will be negotiated at COP 28,” Ploy Achakulwisut, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) scientist and a lead author of the report said in a press briefing. “We need countries to commit to a phase out of all fossil fuels to keep the 1.5C goal alive,” she said. Under the Paris pact, nations have committed to a long-term goal of limiting average temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to attempt to limit them even further to 1.5C. While scientists say fossil fuel use must be reduced to meet the goal, countries have failed to reach any international agreement set phaseout dates for unabated coal, gas or oil use. The report analysed the 20 major fossil fuel producers and found they plan to produce, in total, around 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting the degree of warming to 1.5C, and 69% more than is consistent with 2C. None of the 20 countries have committed to reduce coal, oil, and gas production in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C the report said. It said 17 of the countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions but most continue to promote, subsidise, support and plan the expansion of fossil fuel production. The 20 countries analysed account for 82% of global fossil fuel production and 73% of consumption, the report said and include Australia, China, Norway, Qatar, Britain, the UAE and the United States. The report was produced by UNEP, as well as experts from the SEI, the International Institute for Sustainable Development and think-tank E3G and policy institute Climate Analytics."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Month after month since June, the world has been abnormally hot. Scientists have compared this year’s climate-change fallout to “a disaster movie” — soaring temperatures, fierce wildfires, powerful storms and devastating floods — and new data is now revealing just how exceptional the global heat has been. Two major reports published this week paint an alarming picture of this unprecedented heat: Humanity has just lived through the hottest 12-month period in at least 125,000 years, according to one, while the other declared that 2023 is “virtually certain” to be the hottest year in recorded history, after five consecutive months of record-obliterating temperatures. “We have become all too used to climate records falling like dominoes in recent years,” David Reay, executive director of the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute at the University of Edinburgh, told CNN. “But 2023 is a whole different ball game in terms of the massive margin by which these records have been broken.” The period from November 2022 to the end of October 2023 was the hottest 12 months, with an average temperature of 1.32 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to an analysis of international data, published Thursday by the nonprofit research group Climate Central. El Niño — a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific — is just beginning to boost temperatures, the report found. The strong, long-term trend of global warming is primarily driven by the burning of planet-heating fossil fuels. “The key is this is not normal. These are temperatures we should not be experiencing,” Andrew Pershing, vice president for science at Climate Central, said on a call with reporters. “We are only experiencing them because we have put too much carbon dioxide onto the atmosphere.” The vast majority of humanity was affected by unusual heat over this 12-month period, researchers found, with 7.3 billion people — 90% of the global population — experiencing at least 10 days of high temperatures “with very strong climate fingerprints.” In India, 1.2 billion people — 86% of the population — experienced at least 30 days of high temperatures, made at least three times more likely by climate change. In the United States, that figure was 88 million people, or 26% of the population. Some cities were particularly hard hit. In the US, these were concentrated in the South and Southwest. Houston experienced the longest extreme heat streak of any major city on Earth, according to the report, with 22 consecutive days of extreme heat between July and August. Only two countries, Iceland and Lesotho, experienced temperatures that were cooler-than-average over this period, the report found. Climate Central’s findings come on the heels of another analysis, published Wednesday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which said that 2023 is “virtually certain” to be the hottest year on record. The prediction follows the report’s finding that last month was the hottest October on record by a significant margin, beating the previous record set in 2019 by 0.4 degrees Celsius. The month was 1.7 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial average. “October 2023 has seen exceptional temperature anomalies, following on from four months of global temperature records being obliterated,” Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, said in a statement. Every month since June has smashed monthly heat records and every month since July has been at least 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The year to-date is averaging 1.43 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to Copernicus — perilously close to the internationally agreed ambition to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. While scientists are most concerned about long-term temperature trends, the past several months above that threshold have been an alarming taste of what the world can expect as global warming accelerates. “The likely impacts of this extra heat are well understood,” Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist and professor at the University of Reading in the UK, told CNN. “We are already seeing its impact in more violent storms, heavier rains and floods, and more intense, frequent and longer heatwaves, droughts and wildfires.” In addition to unprecedented land temperatures, ocean temperatures continued to soar. They have consistently been at record-high levels since the beginning of May, according to Copernicus, fueling an explosive development of hurricanes and tropical storms around the planet, including Hurricane Otis, which slammed into Southern Mexico last month. Antarctic sea ice also remained at record-lows for the sixth consecutive month, according to the report. “Laid out so starkly, the 2023 numbers on air temperatures, sea temperatures, sea ice and the rest look like something out of a disaster movie,” Reay said. While the statistics in these reports are big and alarming, it’s what’s behind them that’s truly terrifying, said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London. “The fact that we’re seeing this record hot year means record human suffering,” she said in a statement. Even as 2023 draws to a close, the extraordinary heat shows little sign of letting up. China saw more than 12 monthly temperature records broken on Monday, with temperatures reaching 34 degrees Celsius (93 Fahrenheit) in some places. While in the US, multiple heat records have fallen this week, with parts of Texas reaching 93 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday, beating previous November records. And records are predicted to continue to be broken next year. “El Niño is really going to bite next year and that’s going to lead to even more warming as we head into 2024,” Pershing said. The unprecedented global heat adds extra urgency to the upcoming UN COP28 climate conference in Dubai this December, where countries will take stock of their progress towards meeting the Paris Climate Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. Scientists are clear that this means stopping burning oil, gas and coal. But a report published by the UN on Wednesday found that governments are planning to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels than the limit that would cap global heating at 1.5C degrees. “The only thing more remarkable than the magnitude of these increases in global temperature and sea ice loss,” Reay said, “is our continuing failure to put the world on track to meet the Paris climate goals.” CNN’s Robert Shackelford, Sara Tonks and Brandon Miller contributed to this report"

It’s the first time Census projections have forecast a population dip — caused in part by an ...","Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN","The US population is projected to peak in 2080, then start declining, according to a new analysis by the US Census Bureau. Projections released Thursday predict the country’s population will reach nearly 370 million in 2080, and by 2100 will have declined to 366 million. It’s the first time Census projections have indicated the US population will decline, according to William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. But as the US population ages and the birth rate declines, these latest Census projections reveal how the number of newcomers arriving in the US could significantly change this picture going forward. In addition to what analysts predict is the most likely scenario, based on current immigration trends, the projections show what US population growth could look like with higher immigration, lower immigration or zero immigration. In the zero-immigration scenario, the US population would peak next year at 333.4 million. In the lower-immigration scenario, it would peak at 345.9 million in 2043. If immigration increases, then the population is projected to continue climbing through the end of the century. “These (projections) emphasize that immigration is an even a bigger contributor long-term to our demographic growth and stability than perhaps it was in the past,” Frey says. The Census analysis also predicts a slower rate of population growth than previous projections, due to new data reflecting recent trends, Census demographer Sandra Johnson said in a news release. “The U.S. has experienced notable shifts in the components of population change over the last five years,” Johnson said. “Some of these, like the increases in mortality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, are expected to be short-term while others, including the declines in fertility that have persisted for decades, are likely to continue into the future.” Experts look at three major factors when predicting population growth: births, deaths and immigration. For years, demographers have pointed out that the US population growth rate is slowing as birth rates decline. When that’s happened in the past, immigration has made up the difference. But how many people come to the US can change based on policies and politics here and around the world. A document explaining Thursday’s Census projections says immigration is “arguably the most uncertain of the population change components” used in projections. But despite its uncertainty, immigration is vitally important, Frey says. “We’re a country that’s getting older. It’s growing more slowly. Immigration is able to put some of the brakes on that so that we’re not in the situation of Japan or Germany or Italy, which have much more difficulty in terms of the already slowing labor force or declining population.” Overall, the world’s population is rising and could peak at a record 10.4 billion in the mid-2080s, according to the United Nations. And this year, India overtook China to become the world’s most populous country. Meanwhile, China and many European nations have started to see birth rates dropping. Many demographers and economists see cause for concern. But some environmental activists are less worried, describing potential population declines as a trend that could help the planet. Still, Frey says, something about the latest Census projections stands out. The low rate of population growth, and the projections of a decline, are something “we’ve really not seen for most of our lifetimes, until now.”"

Significant rain and snow is in the forecast for the Golden State, while damp, dreary days are ahead for other parts of the West as signs of El Niño’s influence on the upcoming winter season emerge. November got off to a wet start across the Pacific Northwest, but the rainy weather didn’t make it south into much of California. Two things will bring a dramatic change to that trend next week: a southward dip in the jet stream – the river of fast-moving air that carries storms around the planet – will be pointed directly at California; and a large area of disruptive atmospheric energy will linger just off the West Coast. Next week’s storms will be fueled in part by an atmospheric river – the region’s hallmark type of winter storm, which transports abundant moisture from the tropical Pacific straight to the West Coast. The West was drenched by many of these systems last winter: California alone saw at least a dozen significant atmospheric rivers, which claimed at least 18 lives and dealt tremendous damage to infrastructure. But they also brought much-needed rain and snow to a region that desperately needed it, filling reservoirs and allowing water officials to take stock and prepare for a future with less freshwater. Atmospheric rivers are categorized on a five-point scale, with 1 describing “weak” storms and 5 classified as “exceptional.” Next week’s event is shaping up to be at least a Level 2 of 5 – in other words, a “moderate” atmospheric river. Rain will push into Northern California as early as Monday, spreading to parts of Central California on Tuesday. The timing for rain in Southern California depends strongly on the exact evolution of the storm early next week, but wet weather will likely commence by late Wednesday or Thursday. Once rain begins, it will continue at varying intensity for much of the week and into the weekend for some areas. Rainfall amounts are not expected to reach catastrophic levels that would trigger widespread flooding, but many locations could receive more than a month’s worth in a matter of days. Any rain that falls will be notable – California hasn’t experienced multiple days of rain since the summer, and many locations are in a rainfall deficit compared to average. From September 1 to November 9, San Francisco and Los Angeles have each only recorded about 6% of the average rainfall for the period. Despite this rainfall deficit, California is drought-free for the first time in nearly four years: the state reported no areas of drought in mid-October, which was the first such reading since January 2020. Rain isn’t the only concern next week – the stormy setup is primed to deliver significant snow to the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Multiple feet of snow could fall in the highest elevations of the Sierra, with up to a foot in some foothills by next weekend. The elevation where rain will change to snow will start out quite high next week, but snow will likely begin to pile up in the lower elevations of the mountains in earnest late-week as colder air is pulled across the region. Elsewhere across the West, there will be no discernible break from the dreariness with the new influx of wet weather next week, and the Northwest will remain wet both this weekend and next week as moisture continues to funnel across the region. Like many other elements of the upcoming winter – including temperature and snow – studies have shown that El Niño influences the behavior of atmospheric rivers. A 2017 study found atmospheric rivers are more likely to impact the western US during El Niño, when ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific are abnormally high. Not only can El Niño affect where atmospheric rivers dump the most precipitation, its strength can also affect how often they occur. A study published in January found the frequency of atmospheric rivers increased during strong El Niño years – the level expected this winter. Like any weather phenomenon, atmospheric rivers aren’t dependent on just one variable. So, having a strong El Niño in place doesn’t necessarily guarantee a higher frequency of atmospheric river events. For example, the 2017 study also found that atmospheric rivers are less likely to impact the western US during La Niña.

Before-and-after photos reveal decades of change,11-13-2023,                                                 The comparison found that the rate of glacial retreat in Greenland during the 21st century has been twice as fast as the retreat in the 20th century.                                             ,"Rachel Ramirez, CNN","When Laura Larocca visited Denmark in 2019, the climate scientist sifted through thousands of old aerial photographs of Greenland’s icy coastline, which were rediscovered in a castle outside Copenhagen about 15 years ago. Now housed in the Danish National Archives, the historical images inspired her and other researchers to reconstruct the territory’s glacial history and how it has changed amid a rapidly warming climate. After digitizing thousands of archived paper images dating back to the 1930s, Larocca’s team combined them with satellite images of Greenland today to measure how much its frozen landscape has changed. The comparison found Greenland’s glaciers have experienced an alarming rate of retreat that has accelerated over the last two decades. The study, published this week in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that the rate of glacial retreat during the 21st century has been twice as fast as the retreat in the 20th century. The work was “very time consuming, and it took a lot of people, a lot of hours of manual labor,” said Larocca, the lead author of the study who was a postdoctorate at Northwestern University at the time of the research. “The change is stunning — it really highlights the fast pace at which the Arctic is warming and changing.” Over the past several decades, the Arctic has warmed four times faster than the rest of the world, a 2022 study showed. The fallout of that warming is mounting. For the first time on record, it rained at the summit of Greenland — roughly two miles above sea level during the summer of 2021. Earlier this week, scientists found that northern Greenland’s huge glaciers, which were long thought to be relatively stable, now pose potentially “dramatic” consequences for sea level rise. What struck Larocca the most was how the Danish pilots who took the original photos had no idea they would be a major contribution to climate science nearly a century later. “It is quite interesting that a lot of these photos were taken because of military operations,” she said. “So, they have ties with a lot of international and US history, as well. But it’s kind of neat how over 100 years later, we’re using these photos for science to document how much these glaciers have changed over time.” Larocca, now an assistant professor at Arizona State University School of Ocean Futures, said she hopes this new visual-heavy study will draw attention to the rapidly melting territory and the threat it poses to the world’s coastlines as sea level rises. “[The paper] really reinforces that our choices over the next few decades and how much we reduce our emissions really matter to these glaciers,” Larocca said. “Every incremental increase in temperature will have significant consequences for these glaciers, and that swift action to limit global temperature rise will really help to reduce their future loss and contribution to sea level.”"

It’s the largest area of exceptional drought on record in the state. Exceptional drought has also spread across nearly half of Mississippi and a portion of eastern Texas. A significant rainfall deficit resulting from an incredibly hot and dry summer is to blame for these expansive areas of drought along the Gulf Coast, but multiple days of rain this week will help the region make up some crucial ground. Widespread rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected across southern Louisiana, mainly south of Interstate 10, from Monday to Wednesday. Higher amounts are possible along the coastline, where up to 5 inches could fall in some locations. “Any kind of rainfall we can get, especially when it’s widespread like this, is very beneficial to the area,” said Doug Cramer, a warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Showers and areas of steady rain spread across parts of the Texas and Louisiana early Monday as a slow-moving storm churns just off the coast. Rainfall will expand in scope and become steadier across Louisiana by late Monday and continue through at least Wednesday morning as the storm moves slowly over the northern Gulf of Mexico. The rainfall is unlikely to cause significant flooding, but the stormy weather will lead to choppy seas and coastal flooding at high tide. By Wednesday, rain will expand farther eastward to drench portions of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Whether the rainfall will make enough of a dent in Louisiana’s exceptional drought to warrant a downgrade in drought intensity remains to be seen. “It’s possible,” Cramer told CNN, noting it is difficult to say with any certainty whether drought categories will change until a rainfall analysis begins after the event concludes. “It does appear as though [Louisiana] is going to continue to see rain chances over the next couple of weeks, so that’s good news,” Cramer added. Year-to-date, parts of Louisiana have had less than half of the rainfall typically recorded at this point in the year. As of Sunday, only 27 inches of rain had fallen in New Orleans – the second-driest year-to-date the city has ever reported by early November. New Orleans typically receives close to 56 inches of rain by early November. In the long term, Cramer pointed to El Niño as further good news for drought reduction. “El Niño is typically wet along the Gulf Coast over the winter time, so we’re optimistic we can start to move the needle on this.” CNN’s Robert Shackelford contributed to this story."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","In the latest clear evidence that the world remains wildly off track when it comes to tackling the climate crisis, the UN has found that even if countries enact all of their current climate pledges, planet-heating pollution in 2030 will still be 9% higher than it was in 2010. This reveals a stark gap between the course nations are charting and what science says is needed to avert the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world needs to decrease emissions by 45% by the end of this decade compared to 2010 to meet the internationally-agreed ambition of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. An increase of 9% means that target is way off. Scientists consider 1.5 degrees a key threshold beyond which climate change impacts — including more frequent and more severe heat waves, droughts and storms — will become hard for humans and ecosystems to adapt to. The findings are from a report published Tuesday by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which every year analyzes individual national plans to slash emissions — called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — of the 195 countries signed up to the Paris Climate Agreement. Despite a dramatic increase in dire warnings from climate scientists, emissions are still on the rise. This year’s NDC Synthesis report does, however, offer a tiny glimmer of hope. The findings show that the upward trend in emissions is at least starting to slow, and emissions could peak and start decreasing before the end of the decade. Projections show that emissions in 2030 will be 2% lower than they were in 2019, and 3% lower than the estimated levels for 2025, according to the report. That’s largely because some countries have recently boosted the ambition levels of their climate plans, which has translated to a fractional improvement on last year, when the UN found countries were on track to increase emissions by 11% by 2030 compared to 2010 — and the year before that, when the figure was 14%. But these are all very much “baby steps,” said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, in a statement. UN Secretary General António Guterres said the report shows that “the world remains massively off track to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoiding the worst of climate catastrophe.” “Global ambition stagnated over the past year and national climate plans are strikingly misaligned with the science,” he added in a statement. “As the reality of climate chaos pounds communities around the world — with ever fiercer floods, fires and droughts — the chasm between need and action is more menacing than ever.” A second UN report also published Tuesday analyzed countries’ 2050 plans to reach net zero — where they decarbonize their economies as much as possible and remove any remaining planet-heating pollution from the atmosphere. It found that if all long-term strategies were implemented on time, these countries’ emissions could be roughly 63% lower in 2050 compared to 2019. Although the report noted that many net zero targets remain uncertain and have long deadlines, postponing critical action into the future. Tuesday’s findings follow the UN’s Global Stocktake report released in September, which also confirmed that governments are not moving fast enough to avoid catastrophic levels of warming. It warned there was “a rapidly narrowing window to raise ambition and implement existing commitments.” Stiell said these findings should catalyze bolder action at the UN’s upcoming COP28 climate summit in Dubai. “Every fraction of a degree matters, but we are severely off track,” he said. “COP28 is our time to change that.” At COP28, countries will complete the global stocktake exercise, where they assess progress on climate action. The process is intended to feed into the next round of more ambitious national climate action plans due to be submitted to the UN in 2025."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/climate/lancet-countdown-report-climate-health/index.html,Health experts say world needs to end fossil fuel use as new report finds a rise in climate-related mortality,11-15-2023,"                                                 The climate crisis is carrying a mounting health toll that is set to put even more lives at risk without bold action to phase out planet-warming fossil fuels, a new report from more than 100 scientists and health practitioners found.                                             ","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","The climate crisis is carrying a mounting health toll that is set to put even more lives at risk without bold action to phase out planet-warming fossil fuels, a new report from more than 100 scientists and health practitioners found. The annual Lancet Countdown report, released Tuesday, found that delaying climate action will lead to a nearly five-fold increase in heat-related deaths by 2050, underscoring that the health of humans around the world is “at the mercy of fossil fuels.” Despite these growing health hazards and the costs of adapting to climate change soaring, authors say governments, banks and companies are still allowing the use of fossil fuels to expand and harm human health. “We’re seeing that we’re moving in the opposite direction to where we should be going with the expansion of private companies’ oil and gas production plans, financing going toward the fossil fuel sector, and all in all a promotion of oil and gas burning that is threatening our survival around the world,” Marina Romanello, Lancet Countdown’s executive director and lead author, told CNN. “Mortality is just the tip of the iceberg of the enormous burden that comes with heat,” she added. If the world continues down this fossil fuel-dependent path, Romanello stressed that the cascading consequences could be catastrophic not only for human health but also the economy. The planet has already warmed roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era in the late 1800s. When the world is 2 degrees warmer, the report found countries will start to see a 50% increase in labor capacity loss because of exposure to extreme heat, which could lead to enormous economic losses and losses to livelihoods and wellbeing. More than half a billion more people in the world will suffer food insecurity by mid-century, the report found, if the planet warms 2 degrees. “The underlying message is that we need to pursue efforts urgently to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees, but that every fraction of a degree of temperature increase matters,” Romanello said. But even today with a 1.2-degree increase, large parts of the globe have already witnessed a sinister cocktail of devastating impacts. During Europe’s hottest summer on record in 2022, nearly 62,000 people have died of heat-related causes. That year, every person around the world on average was exposed to 86 days of health-threatening, scorching temperatures, 60% of which were twice as likely to happen by human-caused climate change, according to the report. That trend persisted — if not, worsened — this summer, with vast swaths of the world experiencing firsthand how dangerous extreme heat can be. In the US, officials in Maricopa County, Arizona, reported that more than 579 people have died of heat-related illness this year, with over 50 deaths still under investigation, making 2023 the deadliest year for heat deaths since the county began tracking them in 2006. Heat-related fatalities have risen dramatically in the US in recent years. In 2022, more than 1,700 deaths were due to heat-related causes, according to an analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — more than doubling over the past five years. And that data is likely an underestimate, experts say, because extreme heat exposure isn’t always well documented. Rachel Licker, principal climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that managing the health risks of climate change isn’t a new experience for some, but for many, it was a “wakeup call to the new realities” the world will be facing if it continues to burn more fossil fuels. “This new report brings these realities into focus, including the sad reality that the health risks of climate change are most serious for those who are already most vulnerable,” Licker, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. “It’s also maddening to look forward and see us continuing on this path when the risks are so clear, as laid out in the latest Lancet report.” Tuesday’s analysis found that many of these heat-related deaths could have been prevented if the planet hadn’t warmed as much as it did, particularly for the elderly, babies and the most vulnerable communities. “For the first time this year, we have done an analysis to see what would have happened if temperatures hadn’t changed,” Romanello said. “And what this is showing us is that if temperatures hadn’t changed from the 90s, we would have seen less than a half this increase in heat-related mortality just by demographic changes.” The world is rapidly approaching irreversible harm, the authors warn. And the only way to prevent that from escalating is to swiftly transition the global economy to net-zero by halting the burning of fossil fuels — not increasing them. The report comes just weeks before the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, where world leaders will discuss how to protect public health amid a changing climate for the first time since the annual summit began more than two decades ago. Countries will also engage in critical negotiations on whether or not to phase out fossil fuels in the coming years. “The expansion of oil and gas is undermining our health, our being, and our collective future,” Romanello said. “We absolutely need to call for fossil fuel phase-out. This will be quite a sticking point at this COP, and the health argument is what matters the most.”"

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","The effects of a rapidly warming climate are being felt in every corner of the US and will worsen over the next 10 years with continued fossil fuel use﻿, according to a stark new report from federal agencies. The Fifth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report due roughly every five years, warned that even though planet-warming pollution in the US is slowly decreasing, it is not happening nearly fast enough to meet the nation’s targets, nor is it in line with the UN-sanctioned goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius – a threshold beyond which scientists warn life on Earth will struggle to cope. This year’s assessment reflects the reality that Americans can increasingly see and feel climate impacts in their own communities, said Katharine Hayhoe, a distinguished climate scientist at Texas Tech University and contributor to the report. “Climate change is affecting every aspect of our lives,” Hayhoe told CNN. Some of the report’s sweeping conclusions remain painfully familiar: No part of the US is truly safe from climate disasters; slashing fossil fuel use is critical to limit the consequences, but we’re not doing it fast enough; and every fraction of a degree of warming leads to more intense impacts. But there are some important new additions: Scientists can now say with more confidence when the climate crisis has made rainstorms, hurricanes and wildfires stronger or more frequent, long-term drought more severe and heat more deadly. This summer alone, the Phoenix area baked through a record 31 consecutive days above 110 degrees, a shocking heatwave that was partly responsible for more than 500 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County in 2023 – its deadliest year for heat on record. In July, a torrential rainstorm deluged parts of Vermont in deadly floodwaters. Then in August, Maui was devastated by a fast-moving wildfire and Florida’s Gulf Coast was slammed by its second major hurricane in two years. President Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Tuesday and is expected to unveil more than $6 billion in funding to strengthen climate resilience “by bolstering America’s electric grid, investing in water infrastructure upgrades, reducing flood risk to communities, and advancing environmental justice for all,” an administration official said. The US needs “a transformation of the global economy on a size and scale that’s never occurred in human history” to “create a livable future for ourselves and our children,” White House senior climate adviser John Podesta told reporters. Here are five significant takeaways from the federal government’s sweeping climate report. The latest report contains an important advancement in what’s called “attribution science” – scientists can more definitively show how climate change is affecting extreme events, like heatwaves, droughts to hurricanes and severe rainstorms. Climate change doesn’t cause things like hurricanes or wildfires, but it can make them more intense or more frequent. For instance, warmer oceans and air temperatures mean hurricanes are getting stronger faster and dumping more rainfall when they slam ashore. And hotter and drier conditions from climate change can help vegetation and trees become tinderboxes, turning wildfires into megafires that spin out of control. “Now thanks to the field of attribution, we can make specific statements,” Hayhoe said, saying attribution can help pinpoint certain areas of a city that are now more likely to flood due to the effects of climate change. “The field of attribution has advanced significantly over the last five years, and that really helps people connect the dots.” There is no place immune from climate change, Biden administration officials and the report’s scientists emphasized, and this summer’s extreme weather was a deadly reminder. Some states – including California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas – are facing more significant storms and extreme swings in precipitation. Landlocked states won’t have to adapt to sea level rise, though some – including Appalachian states like Kentucky and West Virginia – have seen devastating flooding from rainstorms. And states in the north are grappling with an increase in tick-borne diseases, less snow, and stronger rainstorms. “There is no place that is not at risk, but there are some that are more or less at risk,” Hayhoe told CNN. “That is a factor of both the increasingly frequent and severe weather and climate extremes you’re exposed to, as well as how prepared (cities and states) are.” Climate shocks on the economy are happening more frequently, the report said, evidenced by the new record this year for the number of extreme weather disasters costing at least $1 billion. And disaster experts have spent the last year warning the US is only beginning to see the economic fallout of the climate crisis. Climate risks are hitting the housing market in the form of skyrocketing homeowners’ insurance rates. Some insurers have pulled out of high-risk states altogether. Stronger storms wiping out certain crops or extreme heat killing livestock can send food prices soaring. And in the Southwest, the report’s researchers found that hotter temperatures in the future could lead to a 25% loss of physical work capacity for agricultural workers from July to September. Unlike the world’s other top polluters – China and India – planet-warming pollution in the US is declining. But it’s not happening nearly fast enough to stabilize the planet’s warming or meet the United States’ international climate commitments, the report explains. The country’s annual greenhouse gas emissions fell 12% between 2005 and 2019, driven in large part by the electricity sector moving away from coal and toward renewable energy and methane gas, the latter of which is still a fossil fuel that has a significant global warming effect. The decline is good news for the climate crisis, but look at the fine print and the picture is mixed. The report finds US planet-warming emissions “remain substantial” and would have to sharply decline by 6% annually on average to be in line with the international 1.5-degree goal. To put that cut into perspective, US emissions decreased by less than 1% per year between 2005 and 2019 – a tiny annual drop. One of the report’s biggest takeaways centers on the precarious future of water in the US, and how parts of the country are facing a future with either extreme drought and water insecurity, or more flooding and sea level rise. Drought and less snowpack are huge threats to Southwest communities in particular. The report’s Southwest chapter, led by Arizona State University climate scientist Dave White, found the region was significantly drier from 1991 to 2020 than the three decades before. White said that’s an ominous sign as the planet continues to warm, with significant threats to snowpack in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains and the Rockies – both of which provide crucial freshwater in the West. White added that a lack of freshwater in the region also has significant economic and agricultural impacts, as it supports cities, farms, and Native American tribes. “Mountains are our natural reservoirs in the region,” White told CNN. “Climate impacts on that mountain snowpack have really significant negative effects for the way our infrastructure operates. It’s just critical for us to protect those resources.” CNN’s Donald Judd contributed to this report."

They’ve been discovered in drinking water, food, air and even in blood. Now, scientists have found that these tiny particles might even be able to influence the weather. Researchers reported Wednesday they detected microplastics in a majority of cloud samples taken from a mountaintop in China, in a study published in the American Chemical Society’s Environmental Science & Technology Letters. The study traced how the microplastics ended up at their final location and discovered that they could play a role in cloud formation. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic that are no larger than five millimeters, which is about the size of a single sesame seed. And they are everywhere, according to Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, a group working to end plastic pollution. “Microplastics are in the air we breathe, they’re in our drinking water, they’re in our bodies,” Enck told CNN. Microplastics form when larger plastics break down, either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces. “If it’s plastic, you’re going to get microplastics sooner or later,” Enck said. The smaller a microplastic is, the easier it can move through environmental cycles – like the water cycle – and ultimately end up in the human body, where its effects are worrisome but still unclear. Most experts believe more research is needed to determine the full impact of microplastics on human health, but studies have shown that there are already some demonstrable adverse health impacts. The authors of Wednesday’s study found microplastics affect cloud formation, and clouds are of huge importance to the weather we experience. Clouds produce precipitation in the form of rain, snow and everything in between. They also block sunlight, and less solar radiation means cooler temperatures. In order for a cloud to form, water vapor – a gas – needs to turn into water droplets – a liquid. Then, many water droplets need to come together to become a cloud. Water droplets form when water vapor interacts with tiny solid particles in the atmosphere, like dust, ash or salt from the ocean. According to the study, microplastics can now be added to that list. These particles are hydrophilic, which means they are attracted to water. Once the first water droplets cling to microplastics and other tiny particles, more water droplets are pulled together and clouds form. The process is akin to how a single spark can eventually set an entire field ablaze: One tiny particle in the atmosphere can set into motion a process that becomes something much bigger. According to the study’s authors, further research must be completed to fully understand the extent to which microplastics influence cloud formation. Could a greater concentration of microplastics lead to more clouds? Will an increase in clouds lead to more precipitation or larger swaths of cooler conditions? These questions remain unanswered. Microplastics are tiny and light enough to get picked up by the wind and hoisted into the atmosphere. The study’s authors found samples of microplastics in the air over Mount Tai in China, and developed computer models to recreate the journey those particles would have had to take to end up there. The models suggested that the flow of air from nearby highly populated inland Chinese cities served as a major source of the microplastics. This suggests microplastics produced at ground level were lofted and carried large distances. There are more microplastics found in cities than rural areas, in general, since a higher population density often leads to a higher demand for plastic products. However, rural areas are quickly catching up with microplastic production, according to Enck."

But even that bright spot had dimmed over the past year, with Beijing cutting off climate talks with Washington in retaliation for a high-level US visit to Taiwan last summer. The statement on Wednesday, released separately by the US State Department and China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, followed days of meetings between US climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the Sunnylands retreat in California earlier this month. The two envoys also met in Beijing for talks this summer. The two sides decided to “operationalize” a suspended bilateral working group to “engage in dialogue and cooperation to accept concrete climate actions” in this decade, according to the statement. That working group was first proposed by Kerry and Xie in 2021 at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, but has been on hold since August last year. The statement also vows a major ramp-up of renewable energy including wind, solar, and battery storage to help run each country’s massive power sector – specifically to take the place of planet-warming fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. China and the US committed to “sufficiently accelerate renewable energy deployment” in their economies until the end of 2030 to speed up “the substitution for coal, oil and gas.” They also pledged to support efforts to “triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2030,” and said they plan to meaningfully reduce emissions from their power sector within this decade. Both countries agreed to economy-wide reductions of all greenhouse gases in their international climate commitments for 2035, including carbon dioxide, methane and hydrofluorocarbons. The agreement involves attempting to cut emissions in line with keeping global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius – a crucial threshold above which scientists say climate change effects such as heatwaves and droughts will become difficult for humans and entire ecosystems to adapt to. The statement marks the first time China has officially stated its intent to control the release of all greenhouse gas emissions – not just carbon dioxide as outlined in its current climate goals, said a Chinese climate scholar in Beijing, who spoke on the condition of anominity as he did not obtain approval to speak to the media. Methane in particular is a greenhouse gas that scientists have homed in on in recent years as one to target for reduction, as its warming power is roughly 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term. Last week, China produced a plan to reduce its methane emissions, though experts have criticized it as weak and lacking no firm targets. “Under the current political environment, both parties have tried their best to find some practical and feasible points that can be advanced. It is very pragmatic,” the climate scholar in Beijing said. Li Shuo, the director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said China’s pledge to set release targets for all greenhouse gas emissions was arguably the most notable point in the statement. “Carbon dioxide is only one of the greenhouse gases. Non-carbon dioxide gases such as methane still account for a considerable share of China’s greenhouse gas emissions,” he said. “If you don’t include them, you’re not actually covering a significant portion of the country’s entire emissions.” China had previously committed to peaking its emissions “before 2030,” but has not specified exactly when it would do so. But there are signs that the country’s rapid buildout of wind and solar could be starting to displace coal; a Carbon Brief analysis released this week said China’s emissions could start to fall next year – and could portend a broader shift downward. Still, even with the promises of a significant ramp-up of renewables, there were no explicit words from China on whether it would phase out or phase down its use of coal – the most polluting form of fossil fuel. The Sunnylands statement also comes three weeks before the annual UN climate conference known as COP28, which is being held this year in Dubai. Other countries are frequently watching for signs of cooperation between the world’s two biggest emitters – which can set the tone and pace for the annual conference. Li, at the Asia Society, said the Sunnylands statement was a “timely effort of aligning the US and China” ahead of COP28, as their engagement is “a precondition for meaningful global progress.” But he said the challenging US-China relationship meant the climate agreement between them would only be “floor setting”, not “tone setting” – and COP 28 has its work cut out for it. “The US-China talks will help stabilize the politics when countries meet in the UAE, but critical issues such as fossil fuel phase out still require much political efforts. China also needs to consider what further ambition can be brought to the COP. Stopping the approval of new coal power projects is a good next step,” he added."

Here’s what people should know and how communities can support those who are affected.                                             ,"Kristen Rogers, CNN","Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety. As the climate crisis gets worse, we know of farmers whose crops are drying up and people who lose their homes due to rampant wildfires. But there’s another group for whom the climate crisis is a potentially lethal threat — people with mental health problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or anxiety. And this threat has already become reality for some people. During a record-breaking heat wave in British Columbia in June 2021, 8% of people who died from the extreme heat had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to a March study. That made the disorder a more dangerous risk factor than all other conditions the authors studied, including kidney disease and coronary artery disease. “Until climate change gets under control, things are only going to get worse unfortunately,” said Dr. Robert Feder, a retired New Hampshire-based psychiatrist and the American Psychiatric Association’s representative to the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health. “As the temperature keeps increasing, these effects are going to be magnified. There’s going to be more storms, more fires, and people are going to be more worried about what could happen because a lot more things are happening.” Rising temperatures have also been associated with suicide attempts and increased rates of mental health-related emergency department visits, several studies have found. And long-term exposure to air pollution — which the climate crisis can worsen by adding more particles from droughts or wildfires — has been linked with elevated anxiety and an increase in suicides. What’s going on in the brains of people with schizophrenia or other conditions is just one factor that makes them more vulnerable to extreme heat, air pollution and stress, experts said — and in need of support from loved ones, surrounding communities and policymakers. What makes some psychiatric patients more susceptible to the harms of extreme heat — such as heatstroke or death — begins in a part of the brain called the anterior hypothalamus. Think of it as the body’s thermostat. “That’s the part of the brain that is working to tell you — when you’re too hot or you’re too cold — to begin shivering, to begin sweating,” which is the body’s cooling mechanism, said Dr. Peter Crank, an assistant professor in the department of geography and environmental management at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Crank was the lead author of a March study on associations between temperatures in Phoenix, Arizona, and hospital admissions of people with schizophrenia. “It tells the rest of your brain you need to take behavioral action, like drinking water or putting on a coat when it’s too cold or taking off a coat when it’s warm,” he added. “These disorders, whether it’s bipolar, schizophrenia or manic depressive — all three of them impair the neurotransmission of information to that portion of the brain.” The capacity to regulate body temperature may also have to do with brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine, which are generally lower in the brains of people with these disorders, experts said. “The hypothalamus is directly dependent upon being stimulated by serotonin,” said Dr. Joshua Wortzel, a psychiatrist at Bradley Hospital at Brown University in Rhode Island and chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s committee on climate change and mental health. “Serotonin levels in the brain are affected by temperatures outside, and so you can imagine that when we’re playing around with serotonin levels in the brain with our medicines, that can change a person’s ability to sweat.” Some medications used to treat these disorders can add to the risk by affecting the ability to sweat or raising the body’s core temperature. Antipsychotic medications — often used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, paranoia and delusions — have the greatest effect, Feder said. Those include aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and lurasidone. Some stimulant medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, such as lisdexamfetamine and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine salts, and anti-anxiety medications can also cause this problem. Lithium, a mood-stabilizing medicine, can cause dehydration, Feder added. Lifestyle habits important for managing mental health symptoms can also take a hit. Warm temperatures can also interfere with sleep, an important factor for managing mental health symptoms, experts said. Additionally, “the nature of most mental health conditions is that once you’re diagnosed with it, you are at risk for recurrent episodes of that illness,” Feder said. “And these episodes are often brought on by some type of stress. And climate disasters are certainly a stress.” Homelessness is also high among people with mental health conditions, especially in the schizophrenic population. “And if you’re homeless during a heat wave, that puts you at increased risk for death, because you don’t have access to air-conditioning,” Feder said. Behaviors caused by these conditions can also contribute to a higher risk of heat-related illness or death. The psychosis that people with schizophrenia can experience, for example, can mean they’re not correctly interpreting reality, so “they may not even be aware that they’re overheated, or they may think that the source of their being overheated is due to some bizarre or irrational reason and not do something appropriate to get out of the heat or to make themselves (safer),” Feder said. People with mental health issues are also more likely to self-medicate with drugs that interfere with their body’s ability to sense and respond to heat. If you’re on any of these medications and think no longer taking them is the solution, not so fast. “That would be far worse than staying on the medicine,” which plays a crucial role in your treatment, Wortzel said. Talk with your doctor about whether a medication you’re on or starting makes you more vulnerable to extreme heat since some informational pamphlets for these drugs may not list that risk as a potential side effect. “These are rather just cautions,” he added, “to really just make sure that you’re staying in cooler environments, making sure you’re hydrated — that if climate change continues to get worse, this is going to be really a side effect that we’re going to have to worry more and more about.” It’s not a reason to stop taking antipsychotics, Wortzel said, but it’s good reason to take care of yourself in the heat. Addressing the climate crisis, the root of the problem, is of course the most important solution, Wortzel said. What’s also necessary at the policy level, he added, is expanding access to cooling centers and other resources, and providing more funding for research that would help us better understand the impact of heat on mental health. There are steps individuals and communities can take to protect vulnerable people when hot weather comes. “Patients need to be aware that they are vulnerable to stress,” Wortzel said. “You need to make sure that you have access to air-conditioning, a cooling center, to stay hydrated and to make sure you’re monitoring how much you’re outside, (that) you’re not out in the hottest times of the day, things like that.” Wear sunscreen, hats and light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, Crank said. Taking cold showers can also help keep your core temperature down. “The other thing that people can do is start getting involved in climate activities,” Feder said. “For the anxiety that’s associated with climate change, the best thing people can do is actually get involved in climate (advocacy) groups and start working for changes to the climate crisis.” Feder also suggested people write or talk to their lawmakers about the issue. You should also inform your loved ones of your vulnerabilities so they can offer support. If you’re not someone at greater risk and are wondering how you can help, practice empathy and awareness by keeping water bottles in your car to hand out to those at higher risk of harm from extreme heat. “Take the time to, if seeing someone in distress, call some sort of emergency services so that they can get medical attention,” Crank said. Doing so will likely take only a few minutes out of your day. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated which study Dr. Peter Crank was an author of."

","Angela Dewan and Laura Paddison, CNN","The Earth’s temperature briefly rose above a crucial threshold that scientists have been warning for decades could have catastrophic and irreversible impacts on the planet and its ecosystems, data shared by a prominent climate scientist shows. For the first time, the global average temperature on Friday last week was more than 2 degrees Celsius hotter than levels before industrialization, according to preliminary data shared on X by Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, based in Europe. The threshold was crossed just temporarily and does not mean that the world is at a permanent state of warming above 2 degrees, but it is a symptom of a planet getting steadily hotter and hotter, and moving towards a longer-term situation where climate crisis impacts will be difficult — in some cases impossible — to reverse. “Our best estimate is that this was the first day when global temperature was more than 2°C above 1850-1900 (or pre-industrial) levels, at 2.06°C,” she wrote. Burgess said in her post that global temperatures on Friday averaged 1.17 degrees above 1991-2020 levels, making it the warmest November 17 on record. But compared to pre-industrial times, before humans began burning fossil fuels on a large scale and altering the Earth’s natural climate, the temperature was 2.06 degrees warmer. The breach of 2 degrees on Friday came two weeks before the start of the UN COP28 climate conference in Dubai, where countries will take stock of their progress towards the Paris Climate Agreement pledge to limit global warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, with an ambition of limiting it to 1.5 degrees. One day above 2 degrees of warming “does not mean that the Paris Agreement has been breached,” Burgess told CNN, “but highlights how we are approaching those internationally agreed limits. We can expect to see increasing frequency of 1.5 degree and 2 degree days over the coming months and years.” Copernicus’ data is preliminary and will require weeks to be confirmed with real-life observations. The world already looks on track to breach 1.5 degrees of warming on a longer-term basis in the next few years, a threshold beyond which scientists say humans and ecosystems will struggle to adapt. A UN report published Monday showed that even if countries carried out their current emissions-reduction pledges, the world would reach between 2.5 and 2.9 degrees of warming sometime this century. But 1.5 is not a cliff edge for the Earth — every fraction of a degree it warms above that, the worse the impacts will be. Warming to 2 degrees puts far more of the population at risk of deadly extreme weather and increases the likelihood of the planet reaching irreversible tipping points, such as the collapse of the polar ice sheets and the mass death of coral reefs. Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading in the UK, called the breach a “canary in the coalmine” which “underscores the urgency of tackling greenhouse gas emissions.” But he added that it was “entirely expected that single days will surpass 2 degrees above pre-industrial well before the actual 2 degrees Celsius target is breached over many years.” The data comes on heels of the hottest 12 months on record, and after a year of extreme weather events, supercharged by the climate crisis, including fires in Hawaii, floods in northern Africa and storms in the Mediterranean, all of which have claimed lives. Scientists are increasingly expressing alarm that data on temperatures are exceeding their predictions. A string of reports checking the health of the Earth’s climate and humans’ actions to combat it in recent weeks show that the planet is careening toward a dangerous level of warming, and not doing enough to mitigate or adapt to its impacts. A UN report last week found that according to countries’ climate plans, planet-heating pollution in 2030 will still be 9% higher than it was in 2010. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world needs to decrease emissions by 45% by the end of this decade compared to 2010 to have any hope of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. An increase of 9% means that target is way off. Another UN report also found that the world is planning to blow the fossil fuels production limit that would keep a lid on global heating. By 2030, countries plan to produce more than twice the limit of fossil fuels that would cap warming at 1.5 degrees."

The UN climate summit, explained",11-30-2023,"                                                 Tens of thousands of people are heading to Dubai in early December for COP28, the annual international climate summit convened by the United Nations.                                             ","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Tens of thousands of people are heading to Dubai in early December for COP28, the annual international climate summit convened by the United Nations. With time quickly running out to prevent fossil fuel pollution from causing irreversible harm, discussions between global leaders, negotiators, climate advocates and industry representatives have shifted to how the world should adapt to more deadly heatwaves, stronger storms and catastrophic sea level rise. Despite the widespread impacts of the climate crisis, the annual negotiations have been contentious. The road to consensus on solutions has proven rocky, and has highlighted divisions between rich countries — which emit a majority of the world’s planet-warming pollution — and poor nations, which have contributed the least. Here’s what to know about the world’s most critical climate change conference. A little over 30 years ago, more than 150 countries signed a UN treaty to limit the alarming rise of planet-warming pollution in the atmosphere. While the science behind human-caused climate change was still young, scientists knew even then it would be life-changing. The first COP — the “Conference of the Parties” to that agreement — took place in Berlin in 1995. Member states have been convening on climate change almost every year since. In 2015, at COP21, more than 190 countries approved the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably to 1.5 degrees. Although the Paris Agreement was a landmark moment and set the world on a path that scientists supported, it didn’t get specific about how countries should achieve its goal. Since then, COPs have sought to make the plans attached to the Paris Agreement more ambitious and to be more specific about the changes society would need to make. The climate summit is hosted at a different location each year. While there have been other host countries mired in controversy, the backlash to this year’s host — the United Arab Emirates — has been particularly sharp; not only is the UAE a major oil-producing nation, it has also appointed a top fossil-fuel executive as its COP president. Critics say it’s a conflict of interest to have Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the UAE’s national oil company, taking charge of the most important climate conference of the year. In facing that criticism, the UAE has embarked on a major campaign to boost its green credentials ahead of the summit, CNN has previously reported. In May, more than 100 members of the US Congress and the European Parliament called for Al Jaber to step down, claiming that his role could undermine negotiations. Some key players — including US climate envoy John Kerry — have praised Al Jaber’s appointment. The UAE has rejected criticism that the country is unfit to host the world’s largest climate summit, with the COP28 team previously telling CNN that the UAE was the first in the Middle East to set 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets. Heads of states and governments deliver speeches in the first days of the summit. More than 160 member nations, including the UK, France, Germany and Japan, have confirmed their attendance. Perhaps the highest-profile attendees will be King Charles III, who will deliver an address at the summit’s opening ceremony. Pope Francis was planning to be the first pontiff to attend COP, but the trip was cancelled Tuesday following his doctor’s advice. The Pope’s state of “influenza and inflammation of the respiratory tract has improved,” but the “doctors have asked the Pope not to make the trip planned for the next few days,” Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said in a statement. “Pope Francis accepted the doctors’ request with great regret and the trip was therefore cancelled.” Absent from the speakers list are US President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping — the leaders of the world’s top polluting countries. In mid-November, Biden and Xi pledged to significantly ramp up renewable energy in lieu of planet-cooking fossil fuels, and agreed to resume a working group on climate cooperation. In lieu of Biden, US Vice President Kamala Harris will attend the summit – a trip that was announced following pushback that Biden was missing global meeting on an issue important to young voters. Leaders from major oil-producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Syria, Russia and Iran, are among those attending. There are concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could overshadow action on climate this year, particularly in the Middle East. But representatives from both Israel and the Palestinian territories are listed to speak in the first week. The UAE has also invited many fossil fuel executives to the climate talks, where they are expected to announce new commitments to decarbonize. A list of Wall Street financial heavyweights led by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink will also be present, after missing the summit in Egypt last year. It’s been eight years since the Paris Agreement, yet the world has made barely any progress on slashing climate pollution, and the window is “rapidly narrowing” to do so, according to the agreement’s first scorecard — the global stocktake — which was published in September. COP28 will be the first time that countries will be going into the negotiation rooms with an analysis that shows how seriously off-track they are on their climate targets. “It tells us clearly that the world is not on track to achieve our global climate goals,” Melanie Robinson, the global climate program director for the World Resources Institute, told CNN. “But it also offers a really interesting concrete blueprint [and] mountain of evidence on how we can get the job done, so it should be a wakeup call of what we need to do but with a roadmap to get there.” Some of the biggest concerns that will take center stage in Dubai are continuations from COP27 in Egypt: finalizing a “loss and damage” fund and discussing how to ramp down planet-warming fossil fuels. A major debate among the parties has been whether to “phase out” or “phase down” fossil fuels. At COP27, a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels — including oil and gas — and not just coal. “The most important thing is the outcome at this COP sends a really strong signal that the world must rapidly shift away from fossil fuels,” Robinson said. “I would note that it’s important for the language to refer to all fossil fuels.” Another focus this year will be on the so-called loss and damage fund, which countries included in last year’s agreement. The fund would help shuttle money from the richest countries, which are responsible for the vast majority of the climate crisis, to poor countries, where the impacts have hit hardest. The goal is to get the fund up and running by 2024. With time running out, a special committee met in Abu Dhabi in early November and recommended the World Bank host the fund and serve as its trustee temporarily for four years. The loss and damage fund is a delicate and nuanced issue, said Nate Warszawski, a research associate with WRI’s International Climate Action team. “I do think this could be one of the key issues that makes or breaks the COP,” he told CNN. CNN’s Ivana Kottasová contributed to this report."

","Angela Dewan, International Climate Editor, CNN","In late September, Zimbabwe’s environment minister signed away control over a staggering amount of land — almost 20% of his country — to a little-known foreign company. Blue Carbon was a small, new outfit, not even a year old, but its chief was no fledgling entrepreneur: he was an Emirati royal whose family had ruled Dubai for 190 years, flush with oil money. The Dubai-based Blue Carbon has secured forested land nearly equivalent to the size of the United Kingdom across five African nations to run projects to conserve forests that might otherwise be logged, preventing huge amounts of planet-heating carbon dioxide, or CO2, from entering the atmosphere. Blue Carbon can then use that conservation to create carbon credits to sell to companies and governments to “offset” the climate pollution they generate while they continue to burn planet-warming fossil fuels. The flurry of forest conservation deals with Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Liberia and Tanzania were announced in the months ahead of the annual United Nations’ COP28 climate summit, being hosted this year in December by the United Arab Emirates. But according to several analysts and climate advocates CNN spoke with for this story, these conservation deals are the latest attempt by the petrostate to use green initiatives as a smokescreen for its plans to continue pumping fossil fuels. At the same time, the UAE has said it plans to extract its very last barrel of oil 50 years from now, when its reserves are projected to dry up — decades beyond when scientists say society needs to be done with fossil fuel. A spokesperson would not confirm to CNN that the company would sell those credits to the UAE, but given Blue Carbon’s chairman, Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al Maktoum, is a relative of Dubai’s royal ruler — who also serves as the UAE’s prime minister — the widely held assumption among analysts CNN spoke with is that these credits will be sold to the UAE to offset its enormous carbon footprint. They could also be sold to other oil-reliant nations and companies in the Gulf and beyond. CNN has reached out to the UAE government for comment. Blue Carbon would not confirm to CNN the area size of all its projects, how much money it has provided in financing or how many credits it hopes to generate. The agreements are in initial stages and not yet finalized. But the company did tell CNN it would present its deals at the COP28 summit in Dubai as a “blueprint” for carbon trading. The annual climate summit is where global leaders and negotiators from nearly 200 countries will convene to decide how and when to ramp down fossil fuel use. The UAE is expected to use its COP28 presidency to push hard to include carbon removal — not just from forests, but also from oil and gas as they burn and then storing it underground — central solution to the climate crisis. Climate advocates have criticized carbon removal — and scientists remain skeptical of its efficacy — as a ticket for companies to continue to produce and burn fossil fuels on a large scale, even expand, and profit handsomely. The UAE has a lot to lose, financially. Oil and gas account for around 30% of its GDP and 13% of its exports as of last year, according to the US Department of Commerce. More than 80 countries support phasing out fossil fuels, and renewable energy, like wind and solar, are now so cost competitive in most parts of the world that market forces will eventually squeeze oil and gas out anyway. Unless, that is, fossil fuel companies and lobbyists can convince the world at COP28 not to rely too much on wind and solar, and to keep pumping oil and gas. The UAE has already been hit with a barrage of criticism since it put Sultan Al Jaber — who runs the nation’s mammoth oil and gas company, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and serves as the nation’s international climate envoy — in charge of the negotiations. More than 100 members of the US Congress and the European Parliament in May called for Al Jaber to be replaced as COP28 president. Al Jaber sees no conflict of interest in his many roles, he has said in multiple interviews. Nor does ADNOC, which told CNN in an email that there was “no one more qualified,” to lead the negotiations, pointing to his experience as leader of the nation’s renewable energy vehicle, Masdar, as well as its fossil fuels oil and gas company. Al Jaber has long argued that fossil fuel companies need to be at the table in climate negotiations to ensure the green transition actually happens. There is a certain logic to the argument, but climate advocates aren’t buying it, pointing instead to all the time the fossil fuel industry has had to show leadership on the issue, but hasn’t. Some fossil fuel companies were among the first to understand their products were causing climate change. That was around four decades ago, yet they continued to profit from coal, oil and gas. “I think that ADNOC has turned the UN climate negotiations into a giant greenwashing operation for one of the largest oil companies on the planet,” said Jamie Henn, founder and executive director of the non-profit Fossil Free Media, which supports the movement to end fossil fuels. “It’s been clear from the start when the UAE applied to host this COP that one of the main goals of the meeting was for them to try and situate themselves, and their oil and gas industry by extension, as somehow part of the climate solution.” As of 2020, the UAE was responsible for around 0.53% of the world’s CO2 emissions, according to data from Climate Watch, but with a small population of nearly 10 million people, it’s the sixth-largest carbon polluter per capita. Despite its relatively small population, the UAE was the world’s seventh-biggest oil producer by volume in 2022. Henn said it was “absurd” that the negotiations had been taken over by fossil fuel interests. “It’s like the international tobacco control negotiations being run by Philip Morris. Luckily, the UN has rules in place for those negotiations, where they don’t let tobacco lobbyists at the table,” Henn said. “We need that at COP.” Never has a COP, which is hosted by a different city each year, had so many apparent conflicts of interest. Not only is Al Jaber wearing leadership hats for climate and fossil fuels, but Blue Carbon is so intertwined with the nation’s royals and rulers, it’s difficult to separate its promotion of carbon offsets from the UAE’s interest in continuing fossil fuel production. And it will be in Dubai, at COP28, where the rules of how to buy and sell these very carbon credits will be decided. When asked by CNN if Blue Carbon was looking at more carbon offset deals in Africa, a spokesperson for the company said that “with COP28 around the corner, we will formally announce a few more of our initiatives.” A source with knowledge of the COP28 agenda told CNN the company would use the deals to promote carbon credits as a bigger part of the climate solution. It’s not a big surprise that so many countries have signed up to work with Blue Carbon. Its parent company, Global Carbon Investments, has already agreed to transfer $1.5 billion to Zimbabwe in “pre-financing for carbon credits.” That’s more than the country spends on education and childcare, which combined are Zimbabwe’s biggest national expense. With so little money trickling in from the developed to the developing world to adapt to the climate crisis, carbon credit schemes open a new channel of revenue for forest-rich countries. Cutting down forests or letting them degrade accounts for at least 12% of global planet-warming emissions. It’s their ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that makes them valuable as a climate solution. Yet the idea of creating tradable carbon credits in exchange for not cutting down forests has been widely criticized as problematic. And some of the world’s biggest companies certifying carbon credits have been shown to use accounting methods that exaggerate their project’s true contribution to mitigating climate change. In early November, Swiss entrepreneur Renat Heuberger stepped down from his role as CEO of South Pole — one of the world’s first major carbon credit trading companies — after media reports found the company had overstated the climate value of carbon credits that lay in its Kariba forest project in Zimbabwe. South Pole has denied the media allegations, calling the reports “exaggerated” and “misleading.” In a February news release, the company said, “we strongly refute misleading statements around ‘over-issuances’ of verified carbon credits from one of our flagship climate action projects, the Kariba REDD+ forest protection project.” A spokesperson for South Pole told CNN in an email Heuberger stepped down because the company wanted “fresh leadership for the job required in terms of (quality assurance) and due diligence processes and controls.” “Investment in efforts to conserve forests is always welcome. However, the challenge is that conserving forests isn’t a ‘get out of jail free’ card,” said Julia Jones, a conservation scientist at Bangor University in Wales. “Globally, we need to both stop further loss of forests and drastically cut emissions,” she said. “Using one to offset the other, without very substantial investment in reducing emissions, is problematic.” Land rights are another issue. In some cases, indigenous and customary landowners have been evicted to clear the way for such projects, as they witness their homes, once deemed nearly valueless, transformed into cash cows for polluting companies and countries. The Forest Peoples Programme, a non-governmental organization, says that such evictions have become more common in Kenya since it began allocating land for carbon credits. “Those in control of Africa’s forests stand to earn a lot of money, and corporations appear to be pursuing a new ‘scramble for Africa,’” Justin Kenrick, a senior policy advisor at the Forest Peoples Programme, told CNN in an email. “Meanwhile such ‘conservation’ in Kenya persists with a failed colonial approach of evicting the very communities who know best how to conserve their forests.” Whatever the outcome at COP28, the UAE’s state-run oil and gas company, ADNOC, stands to emerge a big winner, especially if it can convince the world that its “Maximum Energy. Minimum Emissions” slogan is a viable climate solution, even as global temperatures soar and scientists press for rapid fossil fuel cuts. An ADNOC spokesperson did not directly answer CNN’s questions on how many people would represent the company at COP28, but dismissed suggestions the company would benefit from the conference as “incorrect” and “baseless.” ADNOC is expected to hike its oil production by 41% and its gas production by a third by 2030, compared to projections for this year, according to an analysis of industry data by Global Witness, a non-profit focused on environmental justice and human rights. That translates to a 40% rise in its greenhouse gas emissions, Global Witness said. The production boost contrasts with plans among other oil majors: Shell’s production is projected to remain largely flat in that time, while BP envisions a 25-percent production cut by 2030. ADNOC, by 2030, plans to out-produce both companies. ADNOC is starting to look like a new international oil major in other ways, too: It’s expanding its portfolio by buying up assets overseas, such as a gas fields in Azerbaijan, and it has teamed up with BP in a bid to buy a 50% stake in Israel’s NewMed Energy, with a focus on gas exploration in areas including the eastern Mediterranean. It is also buying into projects around renewables and chemicals, the company told CNN. To limit its carbon footprint amid the expansion, ADNOC said in October it plans to capture 10 million metric tons of CO2 a year from its operations by 2030 — a figure Global Witness found was wildly exaggerated in a recent analysis. ADNOC currently has the capacity for 800,000 metric tons per year, though it hopes to capture another roughly 3 megatons per year through two facilities not yet completed. Even if those facilities do come online, Global Witness calculates it would take ADNOC more than 340 years to capture the amount of planet-heating carbon it is expected to emit between 2023 and 2030, if it captured both the emissions from its operations and those that occur from using its oil and gas. ADNOC did not address the calculation in its response to CNN, saying only that it had set its ambition “to achieve net zero by 2045 backed by an initial $15 billion allocation.” “Before this year, most people would have been forgiven for never having heard of ADNOC. The more we learn about this company — whose CEO remember is charged with making meaningful progress on emissions reductions at COP28 — the greater an outlier it becomes,” Patrick Galey, a senior fossil fuels investigator at Global Witness, told CNN. “ADNOC plans not only to produce billions of barrels of oil for decades to come, but it is also positioning itself to be among the most aggressive expanders of oil and gas production out there.” How much the UAE company expands beyond 2030 will depend on what role negotiators see for carbon capture at COP28, and whether it can find new markets abroad.

","Olesya Dmitracova, CNN","Oil and gas producers must confront a “pivotal” choice: continue to accelerate the climate crisis or become part of the solution, the International Energy Agency said in a report Thursday. The industry currently accounts for only 1% of global investment in clean energy, and continues to pump out disastrous quantities of planet-heating gases, including methane, which is roughly 80 times more potent than CO2 in the near term. If the world is to stand any chance of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, drastic action is needed on both fronts, and fast, the IEA said. The warning comes ahead of COP28, a United Nations climate summit starting next week, and as a recent UN analysis shows that the planet is set to heat up by nearly 3 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Scientists predict that warming of that scale could push the world over a number of catastrophic and potentially irreversible tipping points, such as the collapse of the polar ice sheets. “The oil and gas industry is facing a moment of truth at COP28 in Dubai,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement. “With the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible.” Introducing the report, entitled “The Oil and Gas Industry in Net Zero Transitions,” Birol told journalists Thursday there are two measures the industry must take to play its part in limiting global warming to the internationally agreed level of 1.5 degrees. The first is reducing planet-heating pollution from its own operations, such as extracting oil and gas from the ground, processing the fuels and delivering them to consumers. These three activities generate nearly 15% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. “These emissions, including methane emissions, we know that they can be fixed rather easily, quickly and in many cases in a cost-effective manner,” Birol said. This pollution needs to be cut by more than 60% by 2030 from today’s level, the IEA report says. The second measure the agency recommends is a dramatic ramp-up in investments in renewable energy by oil and gas companies, which have been “a marginal force” in the clean energy transition, the report said. The industry invested around $20 billion in clean energy projects last year — only around 2.5% of its total capital spending, the IEA found. That share would need to shoot up to 50% by 2030 to help keep global warming to the less dangerous level of 1.5 degrees. Such an increase would mean a radical change in how oil and gas firms spend their cash. Between 2018 and 2022, the industry generated around $17 trillion in revenue: 40% was spent developing and operating oil and gas assets, 10% went to investors and just a fraction was invested in clean energy, according to the IEA report. Oil and gas companies have been investing in carbon capture technologies to remove carbon pollution from the air and to capture what’s produced by power plants and industrial facilities. The captured carbon can then be stored or reused. But carbon capture is “not the answer,” Birol told reporters. The techniques can play an important role in certain sectors such as the production of cement, iron and steel among others, he said. “But to say that the carbon capture and storage technology would allow the oil and gas industry to continue with the current oil and gas production trends and at the same time bring the emissions down… is, in our view, a pure fantasy.” Limiting the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees would require capturing “an entirely inconceivable” 32 billion metric tons (35 billion short tons) of carbon by 2050, the IEA said. The amount of electricity needed to power this process would exceed current global annual electricity demand. Commenting on the IEA report, Kaisa Kosonen, policy coordinator at Greenpeace International, said: “Industry self-regulation leads to collective disaster, so the real moment of truth will come at this year’s climate summit when governments have the chance to agree to make fossil fuels history, in a fair and fast manner.”"

It ended with stones being thrown at politicians and a surge in popularity for the far right. For an example of how climate change is increasingly becoming a flashpoint in the culture wars, Germany is a good place to start. A proposed law — championed by the Green Party, part of the coalition government — aimed to ban almost all new heating systems that run on oil and gas in favor of more energy-friendly heat pumps. The backlash was swift and severe. Already stretched by soaring food and energy prices, many Germans feared the law would translate to huge upfront costs for homeowners — fears stoked and weaponized by the populist far right-party Alternative for Germany, or AfD. Dubbing it Heizhammer — “heating hammer” — they framed the law as an unaffordable luxury pushed by the out-of-touch elite “moving into your house and deciding what you can and can’t do,” said Miranda Schreurs, professor of environment and climate policy at the Technical University of Munich. “There was a lot of fake news,” she told CNN. Anger morphed into protests, then violence. In September, Green politicians were pelted with stones during an election event in southern Germany. The next month, the AfD surged in the state elections. Despite eventually pushing through a weakened version of the law, it was a disaster for the government. As climate solutions and policies move from the abstract to the personal — our cars, our food and how we keep our homes warm — it has created fertile ground for anger and fear, and has fanned the flames of a culture war long in the making. Those who push these narratives often divide the world into “virtuous” ordinary people on one side, and corrupt, indifferent “elites” on the other, said Stephan Lewandowsky, professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol. As British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak watered down key climate targets in September, for example, he rebranded himself a defender of motorists against the “ideological zeal” of climate advocates. “I am slamming the brakes on the war on motorists,” Sunak said in a video posted on X, as he delayed a ban on selling new gas and diesel cars. Similar rhetoric has been used in other parts of Europe. In the run-up to Poland’s recent elections, the populist right-wing Law and Justice party claimed the opposition wanted to ban meat and force people to eat worms. Meanwhile, Spain’s far-right Vox party vowed to defend the country against “the new climate religion.” But to understand why climate change and the culture wars have become so enmeshed globally, experts say the United States probably holds the key. Standing in front of a West Texas oil rig in September, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican candidate for president, described the Democrats’ climate and clean energy policies as an all-out assault on freedom. “This is all part of an agenda to control you; and to control your behavior,” DeSantis said. “They are trying to limit your choices as Americans, they’re trying to circumscribe your ambitions.” This rhetoric is dark, but it’s not new. The same speech could have been made by an American conservative decades ago, said Michigan State University sociologist and climate expert Aaron McCright. “And why has it stuck around? It’s effective, it does scare people.” The origins of the climate culture war in the US lie in the early 1990s, when a new push for global climate action collided with big geopolitical change, McCright said. In 1992, more than 100 countries agreed to tackle planet-heating pollution in a treaty which was extended by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, compelling major developed nations to lower their climate pollution from coal, oil and gas. Around the same time, the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving a vacuum for a common enemy among Americans. “The communist menace that people on the American right have railed against for decades is gone, and there’s no more boogeyman,” McCright said. The environmental agenda was, in many ways, a perfect replacement. Climate “became the stand-in for everything that’s wrong with the government,” he said. “‘You can’t tell me what I can and can’t do on my land. Federal government — stay away from me.’” At the same time, fossil fuel companies, which knew about the climate impact of their products as early as the 1970s, according to a slew of studies, pumped huge amounts of money into undermining climate science, Lewandowsky said. “They started a propaganda campaign very early.” These events shattered a brief moment of bipartisan consensus on climate. Republican politicians — who had previously been mostly aligned with Democrats on these issues — started to vote en masse against climate action. The public followed In 1992, there was a gap of just 5 percentage points between Republicans and Democrats on support for environmental protection, according to a 2012 study from Pew Research Center. By 2012, that gap had ballooned to 39 percentage points. “If you went into a coma in ’88 and you woke up in ‘95,” McCright said, “you’d probably wake up going ‘what the heck happened?’” When it comes to Americans’ views on climate impacts now, “nothing matters more than partisanship,” Alec Tyson, the lead pollster on a recent survey from Pew, told CNN. That poll found 86% of Democrats expected negative climate impacts to worsen during their lifetime, while just 37% of Republicans said the same. In December 2022, a Democratically controlled Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate bill in US history. It was largely a tax incentive package to encourage people to buy discounted electric cars, electric stoves, solar panels and energy-efficient heating and cooling systems — all carrot and no stick. Not one Republican voted for it. Conservative media has played an outsized role in fueling culture war narratives, according to experts. When progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts introduced the Green New Deal in 2019, a nonbinding resolution aimed at tackling the climate crisis, it became a lightning rod for right-wing media. “The most radical, dangerous policy proposal offered in modern history,” “economic enslavement,” an “eco-fascist” proposal — these were just some of the responses in right-wing publications and on TV networks. Watching Fox News’ coverage of the Green New Deal, you would think “you were going to not be able to have hamburgers, your travel was going to be radically restricted, your freedom of movement was getting taken away,” said Allison Fisher, director of the climate and energy program at progressive media watchdog group Media Matters. The Green New Deal triggered a ramp up of rhetoric the right-wing media has been using for years, Fisher told CNN. Fox has “been laying the groundwork necessary for positioning climate policies as a culture war issue for a long time,” she said. The network’s message has been simple and effective, she added — the “idea that the radical left has manufactured the climate crisis to seize control of every aspect of American life.” A Fox News spokesperson didn’t return CNN’s request for comment on the characterizations. This narrative taps into a defining fear of people on the political right, said Lewandowsky, the psychology professor. “If you’re a conservative or libertarian, then climate change is hell,” he said, because dealing with it means taxes, regulation and bigger government, and for some, “that is extremely challenging at a deep, emotional and intellectual level.” Even in countries like the UK, which tend to be less polarized and hostile toward big government, the conservative media has also been whipping up division over climate, said Ed Matthew of climate think tank E3G. There has been a “significant uptick” in UK newspaper articles calling on the government to weaken climate targets and “trying to create fear,” he told CNN. The aim is to make climate action controversial, Matthew said, “and that’s a very dangerous game to play.” While there is plenty of polling in the US and Europe that shows most people believe climate change is a threat and that they are broadly supportive of climate action, there is still an “incredible gulf” between recognizing the problem and doing something substantive about it, said Jennie King, a climate disinformation expert at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue think tank. This chasm has become wider as the cost of living soars, with many countries teetering on the brink of recession and there are genuine fears about who will pay for climate action. The “final mile” — meaning the policies that directly affect people’s lives — is “where information warfare is consolidated now,” King told CNN. Governments trying to pass climate laws find themselves in a bind: Push bold agendas at the risk of backlash — fueled by those who gain from stoking fear and opposition — or go slowly and put the world even more off track to limit catastrophic global warming and secure a livable climate. Germany — where, for a moment, a heat pump threatened to tear apart the government — is something of a cautionary tale, said Matthew of E3G. The country tried “bringing in regulation really so fast that people just weren’t ready,” he said, giving far-right parties the chance to exploit it and garner support. The key to rapidly transforming economies to slash planet-warming pollution will be “bringing society along and winning social acceptance,” Schreurs said. But, she added, “it’s not going to be easy.”"

",Story by Reuters,"Peru has lost 56% of its tropical glaciers in the last six decades due to climate change, according to a new government inventory released on Wednesday. Peru holds 68% of the world’s tropical glaciers and warming temperatures have led to melting and the creation of new mountain lagoons that risk overflowing and flooding, the National Institute of Research of Mountain Glaciers and Ecosystems said. The report uses satellite imagery until 2020 and shows that 2,084 glaciers are covering 1,050 square kilometers (405 square miles) in Peru, compared to the 2,399 square kilometers of ice and snow in 1962. “In four years, from 2016 to 2020 we have lost almost 6% of these high mountain glaciers,” Beatriz Fuentealba, the institute’s director, said from the Ancash region where many glaciers have disappeared. According to the inventory, 164 lagoons have been formed or are in the process of formation in the last four years, bringing the number of glacial lagoons up to 8,466, covering about 1,081 square kilometers. “The new lagoons could be, in the future, water reserves, but being at high altitudes they cause a danger of overflowing and flooding,” said Jesus Gomez, director of research on glaciers at the Ministry of the Environment. Nearly all of Peru’s tropical glaciers are above 6,000 meters (19,685 feet) above sea level while the new lagoons are at an altitude of between 4,000 and 5,000 meters, the report said. Almost 20 million Peruvians benefit directly or indirectly from the water that comes down from the glaciers, according to the report. “This means that we have lost more than half of our water reserves,” said Environment Minister Albina Ruiz, noting that glacial retreat is impacting the natural mountain ecosystem. “Although we cannot prevent glaciers from disappearing over the years, we can reduce the speed at which they are being lost,” she said, calling for less pollution, more green areas and “above all, recognizing that the mountain provides us with life.”"

","Elizabeth Wells, CNN","When the Seychelles government announced it would allow a Canadian company to explore for oil in its waters in September 2022, it said it hoped it would never have to extract the oil. The  small archipelago nation, off the eastern coast of Africa, is at threat  from crushing sea level rise as the world continues to burn  planet-warming fossil fuels. But long-promised finance from rich  countries to help it make a green transition simply hasn’t arrived,  President Wavel Ramkalawan told CNN in May. So they have had to look elsewhere. “We’re hoping that whilst we do the exploration, all these promises will be fulfilled,” Ramkalawan said, meaning they could leave the oil in the ground. But, he added, “at the end of the day, it’s about survival.” While  not among the poorest developing countries, the Seychelles highlights a  paradox faced by many in the Global South: How to grow their economies  and cope with the expenses of climate-fueled disasters they did least to  cause, while also responding to international pressure to stop burning  fossil fuels. It’s into this space that Sultan Al Jaber has stepped — the Emirati minister and businessman who will preside over the UN-backed COP28 climate talks in Dubai starting on November 30. Al  Jaber’s appointment as COP28’s leader has been met with fierce  criticism among some media organizations, civil society groups and even  politicians in the Global North. That’s because, while he serves as the  UAE’s climate envoy and head of its renewables company, he also runs the  state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). More than 100  members of the US Congress and the European Parliament in May called for him to be replaced as COP28 president-designate. But  Al Jaber’s decision to focus on increasing finance to help developing  countries shift to renewable energy is helping his popularity in the  Global South. “The money must flow smoothly and fast to where it needs to go so that the Global South does not have to choose between climate action and development,” Al Jaber told delegates at a pre-COP opening ceremony in Dubai, in October. For some leaders, this contrasts with a string of broken promises on finance from developed countries. Countries  in the West “promise and don’t deliver, but yet they tell you ‘you have  to keep protecting the planet,’” Ramkalawan said. He said the UAE has  funded wind and solar plants in the Seychelles, adding, “I think the  commitment of the UAE speaks volumes.” Under Al Jaber’s leadership at the pre-COP28 talks, countries reached an agreement on how to run a “loss and damage” fund that would provide some money to developing countries to pay for the outsized impacts of climate change they have experienced. It was a welcome development for some after the rich world had for two years failed to deliver the annual $100 billion to developing nations that it agreed back  in 2009. That money was supposed to reach the most climate-vulnerable  countries by 2020 to help them tackle and adapt to the climate crisis.  Even though the goal was finally reached in 2022, developing nations say it’s nowhere near enough. But many critics have cited the UAE’s plans to expand production of planet-heating fossil fuels as a conflict of interest in the COP28 talks. ADNOC plans to invest $150 billion into scaling up its operations over the next five years. It is currently expanding its production capacity, aiming for 5 million barrels of oil a day by 2027, while the UAE government has said it plans to extract its very last barrel of oil 50 years from now, when its reserves are projected to dry up. That’s despite scientists saying society should be winding down oil and gas use now. Al Jaber and ADNOC deny allegations of a conflict of interest, saying that having someone who knows both fossil fuels and renewables to lead the talks makes sense. ADNOC  told CNN that there was “no one more qualified” than Al Jaber to lead  the talks, pointing to his “20-year career across the renewable energy  and conventional energy sectors” and his decade-long history in climate  diplomacy. Despite  its plans to expand production, ADNOC previously told CNN that it was  still aiming “to achieve net zero by 2045 backed by an  initial $15 billion allocation.” Like  the Seychelles, Kenya too is facing the challenge of how to cope with  the expenses of climate-fueled disasters and rapidly scale up renewable  energy without adequate funding. When  Kenyan President William Ruto, widely considered one of Africa’s  leading climate champions, was asked if he was concerned about  the oil-producing UAE hosting COP28, he told CNN he had no issue because  the country is also among “the biggest investors in renewable energy.” The UAE recently pledged $4.5 billion to finance clean energy projects across Africa. And in June, Masdar — the state-owned renewables firm founded by Al Jaber — was part of a group that signed a deal worth $10 billion to develop a 10GW wind farm in Egypt, billed as the biggest on the continent. “We  are spending inordinate resources to try and manage the effects of  climate change,” Ruto said. He referred to Kenya’s catastrophic  multi-year drought, which scientists found was made 100 times more likely by the burning of planet-heating fossil fuels. Even if the Global North has finally delivered the promised $100 billion of annual funding, it’s still a drop in the ocean compared to what some experts say is needed to help developing countries cope with the escalating impacts of the climate crisis and transform energy systems. A 2022 UN-backed report calculated developing countries will need about $2 trillion a year by 2030. Harjeet  Singh, the head of global political strategy for the Climate Action  Network, said the reality is Western nations have not delivered.  “We  have seen the West only being extractive and very opportunistic, and  actually kept developing countries dependent on fossil fuels,” he said. Although  he remained heavily critical of the UAE’s fossil fuel expansion plans,  he told CNN that the country “has actually made some right noises in  terms of offering investments in renewable energy, which seems  promising.” But others are more skeptical. Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East North Africa Program at Chatham House, said ultimately, the UAE is looking to protect its interests in the energy transition. “It  needs to buy more time to diversify its economy further and wants to  capitalize on its energy resources for as long as possible,” Vakil told  CNN. “By positioning itself at the forefront of the conversation, the  UAE helps preserve its own interests while seeming to champion those of  the Global South.” In  a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the COP28 team said “the  challenge we all face is transitioning to a new energy system while  keeping the lights on.” The  spokesperson said the COP28 team was committed to “ambitious,  achievable, and substantial action,” which means, “holding back  emissions, not progress, by ensuring energy security, accessibility, and  affordability. Otherwise, we risk slowing down socio-economic progress  and undermining support for ambitious climate action.”"

","Eric Zerkel, CNN","Snowfall is declining globally as temperatures warm because of human-caused climate change, a new analysis and maps from a NOAA climate scientist show. But less snow falling from the sky isn’t as innocuous as just having to shovel less; it threatens to reinforce warming, and disrupt food and water for billions of people. Climate scientists say the future of snowfall is pretty clear: A warmer world driven by human pollution means precipitation is more likely to fall as rain than snow, all else being equal. It’s possible in the near term that climate change will cause more extreme winter storms and some years of increased snowfall — like the data shows for the Northeast US — but as global temperature warms, there will be fewer of those years, and eventually we could see snowfall amounts fall off a cliff. “Eventually the laws of thermodynamics mean that as you keep warming you’re just going to transition more and more of that snow over to rain,” said Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist with the National Weather Service in Alaska and the brains behind the data analysis in this story. “You can get away with things for a little bit, and it can hide some trends, but overall the laws of thermodynamics will win out.” Snow also isn’t going to decline linearly, or at a 1-to-1 rate, with rising temperatures, said Justin Mankin, a climate scientist and associate professor of geography at Dartmouth College. Instead, there is more of a tipping point, which would mean that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, “we should expect the losses to accelerate.” “It means we can expect a lot of the places that haven’t exhibited massive snowfall declines to maybe start to exhibit them with just a little bit more warming,” Mankin told CNN. There has already been a 2.7% decline in annual global snowfall since 1973, according to Brettschneider’s analysis of data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. The downward trend is particularly notable in the Northern Hemisphere’s mid-latitudes — the middle area north of the tropics and south of the Arctic, where the US and much of the world’s population resides. The sun is more direct there compared to the higher latitudes, especially during spring and fall when it still snows. The white of snow acts like a car’s sun shade, deflecting sunlight and its heat back to space. Without it, more sunlight is absorbed by the ground, warming the atmosphere. Less snow falling from the sky also means less snow piling up into snowpack — a deep, persistent cover of snow that accumulates during the winter. It is crucial for water supplies because it acts like a natural reservoir, storing water as snow during wet times and then releasing it in the form of snowmelt when water is harder to come by, University of Washington environmental engineering professor Jessica Lundquist told CNN. The threat to water supplies from declining snow is most pronounced in climates subject to more extreme boom-and-bust cycles of precipitation, like the Mediterranean climate found in California and other parts of the American West, Lundquist said. “California is the poster child — it does not rain in the summer in California, and so the snowmelt runoff, the snow that waits and runs off later in the season, is absolutely essential for all of the ecosystems, all of the agriculture, all of the cities or anyone who wants water during the dry season,” Lundquist told CNN. Snowpack provides water to more than 50% of the water supply in the arid West, a 2017 study found. The same study predicted snowpack levels in the West would continue to decline by more than one-third by 2100 under a high increase of planet-warming pollution scenario. As the map shows, the decline in snowfall over the last 50 years has been particularly pronounced in parts of the western US. This trend is in line with other studies which have shown a decline in snowpack at more than 90% of western sites where it is measured. The increase in snowfall in the Northeast seen on the maps illustrates the complicated nature of changing precipitation patterns with climate change, scientists told CNN. “Even though the total snowfall trend was positive, the days per year with snowfall trend is negative,” Brettschneider told CNN. This means more snow was falling over fewer days, which could be a sign of the more extreme snowfall events predicted alongside climate change. “Your likelihood of snowfall extremes actually increases with global warming and that’s because as we heat up our atmosphere, the atmosphere’s ability to be a reservoir for moisture gets enhanced,” Mankin told CNN. “So you get this countervailing response where snowfall extremes can actually increase with global warming.” The increase in Northeast snow is also partly because of the time period these maps are looking at Brettschneider told CNN. Snowfall data is much less reliable before the 1970s, but starting the data in the 1970s also meant the analysis included some exceptionally snowy years for that part of the US. Had the analysis started earlier, it might also show a decline, he said. Understanding the implications of less snowfall on the global water supply is far more complicated than simply saying less snow falling means less available water, Mankin said. It depends greatly on location and a variety of other dynamic snow factors. The important thing to track for water availability is not the amount of snow, but the amount of water in the snow, Mankin said, which can vary greatly. A light, fluffy snow will have low water content, but a dense, heavy snow will have a high water content. Additionally, the same extreme precipitation events causing more snow may also mean more rain, which “could potentially compensate those snow losses,” Mankin said. But the scope of the problem of missing snow is still massive. A 2015 study by Mankin found 2 billion people who rely on melting snow for water are at risk of snow declines of up to 67%. This includes parts of South Asia, which rely on Himalayan snowmelt; the Mediterranean, including Spain, Italy and Greece; and parts of North Africa like Morocco, which rely on snowmelt from the Atlas mountains. But Mankin said the study didn’t capture hyperlocal water management, including potential strategies that could mitigate or even replace water lost from missing snow. “The snow loss becomes a massive management challenge,” Mankin said. “This is not necessarily an insurmountable challenge everywhere, but it is a considerable management challenge, particularly in places like the American West that are heavily reliant on snowmelt runoff.” Mankin and Lundquist both said more research is ongoing to better understand the nuanced relationship between snow and water supplies, especially at a hyperlocal scale, which will help water managers better plan for a more volatile relationship with snow. “There’s no silver bullet here – it’s going to be a constellation of solutions and moneys at various scales that can only be conceived after the scope of the problem is understood and identified,” Mankin said. “To the extent that any of these places are managing water for the status quo — global warming is taking that status quo away,” Mankin said. “To the extent that our infrastructure and our management practices are hard coded to a historical climate — that stuff is irrelevant to the climate that is unfolding.”"

","Clare Duffy and Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Programming note: Listen to a version of this story on CNN’s One Thing podcast with David Rind. Tomato growers in central India have been increasingly worried about the volatility that extreme weather events have brought to the region. For much of the area, the last decade has been punctuated by severe droughts that led to significant crop loss, impacting the livelihoods of local farmers. On the other side of the world, Silicon Valley startup ClimateAi is developing an artificial intelligence platform to evaluate how vulnerable crops are to warming temperatures over the next two decades. The tool uses data on the climate, water and soil of a particular location to measure how viable the landscape will be for growing in the coming years. Maharashtra, India, was one of its first case studies in 2021. Farmers could go into the ClimateAi app and input what seed they were growing and where they wanted to plant it. With that data, ClimateAi ran simulations and found that extreme heat and drought would lead to an approximately 30% decrease in tomato output in the region over the next two decades. It warned growers that they should change their strategy. The results proved pivotal — tomato producers adjusted their business plans by switching to more climate-resilient seed varieties and shifting the times they plant tomato seeds. Finding new growing locations usually takes a while for farmers affected by climate change, but “now it can happen in a matter of minutes, and it also saves them a lot of cost,” according to Himanshu Gupta, who grew up in India and is the CEO and co-founder of ClimateAi. “The way we think about AI is it’s a time and effectiveness multiplier to the solutions for climate change,” Gupta told CNN. Better assessing future risks for farming is just one of the ways artificial intelligence technologies are being used to address the climate crisis. AI first crashed into the public consciousness this year thanks to popular, consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, and experts say the technology is set to revolutionize countless industries. But climate researchers have for years been thinking about how AI — computer programs that can rapidly analyze enormous amounts of data and complete complex tasks in ways similar to how a human might — could help them better understand and address the changing climate. Now, experts say AI is poised to accelerate everything from reducing pollution to improving weather models. “Efficiencies is one thing that AI is very good at, optimizing decisions, optimizing resources,” said Fengqi You, chair professor at Cornell University’s engineering school. “It’s a system that has very strong predictive capabilities that could be tremendously helpful in many domains, ranging from (understanding) small-scale molecules … to broader climate systems to help us fight climate change.” With the breakneck pace at which the planet has been warming, accelerating the speed at which the world deploys and implements solutions is crucial. But for all of AI’s promise, the infrastructure that supports the technology — data centers filled with rows of powerful, energy-sucking computers — could itself be a strain on the environment. Experts say software engineers must work closely with climate scientists to find a balance. “It’s definitely something that has to be considered as this trade-off,” said Kara Lamb, an associate research scientist at Columbia University’s earth and environmental engineering department. Still, “the positives outweigh the negatives in terms of applying it to these types of approaches.” Artificial intelligence is a broad term that refers to various digital tools trained to perform a wide range of complex tasks that might previously have required input from an actual person. Generally, what these technologies have in common is their ability to rapidly process and find connections among vast amounts of disparate data. This makes AI particularly good at things like forecasting and running simulations. And unlike traditional computer programs, AI tools can typically continue learning over time as new data is available or as the systems receive new feedback about the quality of their outputs. While scientific discovery used to be reliant on humans’ ability to gather, observe and analyze evidence, computers can now process large datasets, identify patterns and run digital experiments in a fraction of the time that human researchers would need. “For the climate models, fundamentally we’re trying to solve these equations … how these atmosphere models are interacting, and it takes a long time to solve,” You said. Similarly, research on new energy conduction materials, like those for solar panels, could require countless hours of testing that can now be sped up using AI. “In the past, people used to need trial and error, we’d need … researchers working every day and night,” You said. “Now, because of AI, which doesn’t need to sleep, it just needs electric power, it could keep working 24/7 and it can become very helpful in accelerating discovery.” AI probably won’t replace the need for humans in the climate change fight. But it could make their work faster and more effective. Researchers seeking to restore coastlines by replanting seagrass, for example, are using AI to model the best locations to target those replanting efforts, said Dan Keeler, chief communication officer at impact investing firm Newday, which is involved in charitable efforts to support the coastal restoration. An AI algorithm trained to address the issue could take into consideration everything from toxins in the water or disruptive shipping routes to how replanting efforts could impact nearby sea life or even coastal tourism. “It’s very difficult to put all those together into a single model with conventional methods, but AI actually makes that much more possible,” Keeler said. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, scientists have found. Rising temperatures are melting sea ice, thawing permafrost and igniting wildfires in what should be one of the coldest regions on Earth. Climate experts have said what happens in the Arctic is a bellwether for the rest of the world. But climate models – which scientists use to predict long-term change – are not capturing how fast it’s warming. With the help of AI, Anna Liljedahl, a scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, can make permafrost forecasts on a seasonal timescale, instead of on the typical 100-year timescale, giving her and other researchers a better picture of how fast the Arctic is melting. “AI is doing the dirty work,” Liljedahl told CNN. “But AI is not perfect, so we see it as a first tool, and then the human will come in after and really check and make sure that things make sense and explore the things that AI suggested.” The technology can also be used for solutions. A 2019 Google DeepMind project trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. AI can also help predict when and where energy demand is going to be highest, allowing grid operators to “make sure they have power online, ready to supply demand, and also that they don’t have power that’s just being produced and it’s going to be consumed, because that’s obviously a tremendous waste,” said Keeler. ClimateAi’s Gupta said the problem is figuring out how to integrate renewable capacity into the existing fossil fuel-dominated grid. AI can identify in real-time which renewable energy sources are available in the areas where consumers want it — optimizing consumer demand and supply for renewables. Elsewhere, AI is also being used to research materials that could effectively recapture carbon from the atmosphere and to model and forecast major floods to help local government agencies better prepare for and react to potential emergencies. The Cool Down, a media company aiming to help consumers better understand the climate crisis and potential solutions, is set to launch an AI tool early next year that will answer user questions about how to live a more sustainable lifestyle, according to Anna Robertson, co-founder and head of content and partnerships. The tool will use data from its site about what kinds of climate information consumers are most curious about to direct users to information, including answering questions like, “What can I do with my old jeans?” or “I want to switch my laundry detergent, where should I start?” “Part of the problem is that the issue itself has become so overwhelming and mostly dominated by doom and gloom and not the solutions we have at our fingertips,” Robertson told CNN. “We want to make it easier for people to make better choices.” There’s a downside to all this computational power: Running artificial intelligence models is energy-intensive, and many data centers are operated in areas that are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, Cornell’s You said. Data centers also typically require water for cooling — a dwindling resource in some places where this computing is being done, including the American West. For now, the amount of energy used to power AI is relatively small compared to what’s consumed by transportation or buildings. “But this is going to grow very fast, and we do need to be very careful at this moment before it grows exponentially,” You said. An October study from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the “worst-case scenario” suggests Google’s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. Developers should be advised “not only to focus on optimizing AI, but also to critically consider the necessity of using AI in the first place, as it is unlikely that all applications will benefit from AI or that the benefits will always outweigh the costs,” the study concludes. Some data center operators are already beginning to address these concerns. Amazon Web Services, the online shopping giant’s cloud computing arm, has pledged to be “water positive” by 2030, meaning the company will “return more water to the communities in which we have our data center infrastructure than we take,” CEO Adam Selipsky told CNN in an October interview. In Oregon, for example, where drought has tightened its grip in recent years, AWS is providing the spent water used for cooling its data centers to local farmers for irrigation at no cost. The companies building and running data centers to carry out AI workloads can also think about strategically placing them in areas where they might require fewer natural resources to operate, You said. If data centers are built in colder parts of the world, for example, less water will be needed for cooling; Scandanavia has emerged as a popular location for data centers, also bolstered by its relatively robust availability of renewable energy sources. Lawmakers in the United States and abroad — who have in recent months increasingly turned their attention to developing guardrails for AI — should consider both the technology’s potential benefits in fighting climate change and its environmental impact when developing regulations, You added. “Regulators, decision makers, policymakers really need to think about this when they are looking at the growth of [the AI] industry,” You said. “The growth of the industry is not only about the software, tools and so on, but also how they operate these data centers.” Tech experts also caution that AI must be made affordable and accessible for low-income nations, particularly those in the Global South that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis yet contribute the least to global pollution, something Gupta hopes to address as he expands ClimateAi’s resources. “When it comes to AI being applied to climate change,” said Gupta, “I think we are just scratching the surface of the potential that exists both in terms of the impact it could create for businesses, but also the impact it could create at the humanity level.” This story has been updated to note that Himanshu Gupta is both the CEO and co-founder of ClimateAi."

","Angela Dewan and Rosa Rahimi, CNN","The United Arab Emirates’ team organizing the COP28 climate talks that begin this week was planning to use its position as host of the summit to strike new oil and gas deals with foreign governments, a cache of leaked documents shows. The documents, which were published by the UK-registered Centre for Climate Reporting, appear to be briefing notes for Sultan Al Jaber — who will preside over the UN climate negotiations — for meetings with foreign officials in the run-up to the summit. They are organized as country profiles, with each document describing talking points for Al Jaber to raise in the meetings. The documents detail each country’s climate progress in key areas — including finance, decarbonizing food systems, uptake of renewables — and identify how their ambitions could be raised. But among those points are also several suggestions to offer new oil and gas projects with the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), which Al Jaber leads. ADNOC did not reply to CNN’s request for comment, but the company previously told CNN that any suggestion it was using the climate talks to promote itself “is incorrect and is baseless.” The documents were first shared with the BBC. A COP28 team spokesperson told CNN in an email: “The documents referred to in the BBC article are inaccurate and were not used by COP28 in meetings. It is extremely disappointing to see the BBC use unverified documents in their reporting.” The spokesperson did not address CNN’s question as to whether the COP28 team was operating independently of ADNOC, nor did they explicitly deny that business interests were discussed. The UAE has already been at the center of widespread criticism for appointing its top oil and gas chief to preside over COP28. As Al Jaber helms the summit, ADNOC is planning to expand its oil and gas production, according to an analysis from a fossil fuel watchdog, CNN has previously reported. The wider ADNOC Group is expanding abroad in a number of other areas as well, including petrochemicals and renewables. In addition to documents’ talking points around climate issues and promoting ADNOC are other suggestions to promote projects with the UAE’s main renewables vehicle, Masdar, which Al Jaber also runs. It’s not clear how many of the meetings actually took place, but the notes offer an insight into how the team hoped to use them as a vehicle for new deals. CNN has reached out to the 15 countries mentioned, three of which confirmed meetings, but said either no business discussions took place or would not confirm if they did. Another two replied to say no meeting occurred. The US, China, France, Germany and the UK are among the countries with briefing notes published by the Centre for Climate Reporting. The organization said there were 27 country profiles in all, but that it had decided to share 15. The Conference of the Parties (COP) host country, which changes every year, typically sends its nominated president-designate to meet with foreign officials to try and ramp up climate action ahead of the talks. The briefing notes read as would be expected for such meetings, until the end of each country’s notes, where suggestions to promote ADNOC and Masdar are included. UN rules say these meetings should not be used to promote the economic interests of the host country. According to the UN’s climate body, the UNFCCC, an elected or appointed COP official should remain “impartial” throughout the process. They are expected to act “without bias, prejudice, favoritism, caprice, self-interest, preference or deference” in the process, according to the body’s code of ethics. “They are also expected to ensure that personal views and convictions do not compromise or appear to compromise their role and functions as UNFCCC Officer.” Among the talking points outlined in the leaked briefing notes was that ADNOC was ready to “expand” its provision liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Germany. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a significant contributor to climate change. The leaked notes said ADNOC has already provided some LNG to the country in February 2023 to help it wean of Russian gas, part of Germany’s new strategy since Russia launched its war on Ukraine. ADNOC has the ambition to supply up to 25% of Germany’s hydrogen import demand, the notes say. Hydrogen can be made from natural gas, which the UAE has large reserves of. A spokesperson for Germany’s Federal Foreign Office confirmed the country’s international climate envoy, Jennifer Morgan, was “naturally in close contact with the COP28 presidency,” but did not comment when asked twice whether the two discussed LNG, or any potential business with ADNOC or Masdar. “In her talks with representatives of the United Arab Emirates, she has been promoting ambitious targets for the upcoming world climate conference,” the spokesperson said. “This also includes a commitment to gradually phase out fossil fuels. We are working for COP outcomes that initiate a true course correction towards 1.5 degrees.” Another document showed a talking point for China centered around ADNOC’s growth supporting energy security in the country, saying that the company was willing to “jointly evaluate” opportunities for LNG projects in places including Mozambique, Canada and Australia. The UAE wants to be removed from Brazil’s tax haven list, which would allow Masdar to invest more in the country, the briefing for that country showed. They also suggested Venezuelan “resources” could be monetized, since the US relaxed its energy sanctions on the country, and that ADNOC and Masdar could help Azerbaijan become an energy hub for Europe, “exporting natural gas and potentially clean electricity.” The other briefing notes shared were for Egypt, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia and Switzerland. The notes did not suggest oil and gas projects would be discussed with all those countries. For the US, for example, the briefing notes touch on potential renewable energy deals, saying Masdar hoped to grow its presence in the US by carrying out “acquisitions” in the short term. The COP28 climate talks come at a critical time, as scientists say the world is “virtually certain” to have experienced its hottest year on record in 2023, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, and the Earth is approaching a series of crucial tipping points. Greenpeace International said that the content of the briefings, if true, were “totally unacceptable and a real scandal.” “The climate summit leader should be focused on advancing climate solutions impartially, not backroom deals that are fuelling the crisis,” Kaisa Kosonen, policy coordinator at Greenpeace International, said in a statement. “This is exactly the kind of conflict of interest we feared when the CEO of an oil company was appointed to the role.” “This summit is the world’s most powerful forum to avert the biggest threat to the survival of humankind, and we urge the Presidency to act accordingly.”"

Wolf, CNN","A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. President Joe Biden is too busy for an international climate summit at the moment. He is not expected to make a third annual trip to the Conference of the Parties, COP28, the annual United Nations-sponsored event at which countries consider collective action to mitigate the effects of a changing climate on the planet. Although Biden’s absence could frustrate climate activists, it cannot objectively be viewed as a lack of concern about the issue – especially when compared with Donald Trump, the former president and current Republican primary front-runner. The first nominating contest in the Republican primary calendar is January 15 in Iowa, less than 50 days away. So it’s worthwhile to compare how Biden, Trump and other 2024 contenders view the climate crisis and how they would respond to it. Releasing an every-five-years National Climate Assessment earlier in November, Biden referred to climate change as the “ultimate threat to humanity.” Trump has built a screed against electric vehicles into his stump speech. Biden has warned everyone that the changing climate threatens the entire country and every American. Trump mocks the threat of sea levels rising and mangles facts, making it seem as if there is no threat at all. “The environmentalists talk about all this nonsense,” Trump said on Fox News this year. Biden’s signature legislative achievements as president are a pair of big spending bills – a bipartisan infrastructure law to update the country’s infrastructure with an eye to efficiency, and the passed-by-Democrats-only Inflation Reduction Act, which, among many other things, is spending hundreds of billions to encourage more affordable electric vehicles and ramp up clean energy production. Biden also set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to about half of 2005 levels by 2030. He wants to use Environmental Protection Agency regulations to ensure that two-thirds of new car sales in the US are EVs by 2032. The same week he released the National Climate Assessment, Biden met with the Chinese President Xi Jinping and the two promised to ramp up renewable energy with the goal of replacing fossil fuels. Trump has a well-documented distaste of renewable energy, a distrust of wind energy in particular and has promised to roll back as much as he can of Biden’s climate agenda. Climate scientists and activists will point to alarming data showing Earth warming faster than expected and argue the US is not doing nearly enough – although more drastic action would take direct bipartisan action by the House and Senate, something that seems unlikely given the power of Republicans representing coal and oil states in the House and Senate. The utility of international agreements is also something to scrutinize. Biden and Xi grabbed headlines for their pledge to work on increasing renewable energy sources, but China continues to grow its reliance on coal power while the US is weaning itself off of coal. In the US, greenhouse gas emissions are down from their 2007 peak. China’s goal is for its emissions to peak in 2030. With COP28, it’s notable that this year’s summit, somehow, is being hosted by the oil-producing United Arab Emirates and presided over by the leader of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Sultan Al Jaber. For more on Al Jaber, read this report from CNN’s Elizabeth Wells. CNN’s climate team has a ton of content in the lead-up to the COP28 meeting. Read these: A UAE company has secured African land the size of the UK for controversial carbon offset projects Fake Twitter profiles, Wikipedia editing and PR battles: Inside the push to greenwash the COP28 climate summit The most extreme position is from Vivek Ramaswamy, the businessman and provocateur who said to boos at a Republican primary debate that the “climate change agenda” is a “hoax.” Others are more willing to accept the scientific evidence. “I do think that climate change is real. I think we have to acknowledge that it’s real,” former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley told Bloomberg Talks in September, although she opposes Biden’s goal of cutting emissions. “I also don’t think we go so extreme that we say we have to do all these things by X year,” she said. Haley said she would end renewable subsidies meant to spur innovation at energy companies. She noted she would let the government take a back seat to industry to tell government what it can accomplish in terms of innovating. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis unveiled his energy plan at an oil rig site in Texas in September, which tells you a lot about what’s inside the plan. As a presidential candidate, he has downplayed the threat of climate change. Rather than an effort to mitigate the effects of climate change, which are already occurring, DeSantis suggested policies to cut down on climate change are a sinister form of government overreach. “This is all part of an agenda to control you and to control your behavior,” DeSantis said. The main focus of the DeSantis plan is to undo Biden’s effort to transition toward EVs and bring down gas prices to $2 per gallon by 2025. CNN’s Laura Paddison and Ella Nilsen wrote about a “fevered culture war” in a recent story that mentions not only DeSantis but also recent developments in Germany and the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Rishi Sunak decided to delay for five years a ban on the sale of new gas and diesel cars by 2030. Americans’ views of how to address climate change are complicated. Strong majorities – roughly two-thirds in Pew polling from June – think the US should prioritize development of renewable energy and work to make the US carbon neutral by 2050. But an equally strong majority said the country should not completely phase out the use of coal, oil and natural gas, but should rather use a mix of energy sources. For example, among Republican and Republican-leaning adults ages 65 and older, three-quarters said the US should prioritize oil, coal and natural gas production. Two-thirds of Republican and Republican-leaning adults under 30 said the opposite, that the US should prioritize the development of renewables. That makes some sense since the younger adults will generally be around to see the effects of climate change far more than the older generation."

Hard-pressed consumers are pushing back,11-28-2023,                                                 The backlash against climate policies has begun as people bristle at their cost. But delaying net-zero measures will hit consumers’ pockets harder in the long run — and cost the planet dearly.                                             ,"Analysis by Hanna Ziady, CNN","“All the rich can afford a new car,” an elderly British woman commented at a recent protest in London against plans to expand a toll on older, polluting vehicles to outer suburbs of the city. “It’s affecting so many poor people… Everybody wants clean air but it’s all about money,” she told Times Radio. Her comments encapsulate growing resistance to pro-climate measures because of the costs they can impose on already stretched household budgets or the hassle they add to daily lives. Many people have seen their incomes eroded over the past 18 months by soaring food and energy bills and high borrowing costs. Even among those who accept that climate action is needed, rising numbers are unwilling or unable to shoulder additional expenses in these circumstances. “Across Europe, a backlash against net-zero policy is underway,” Brett Meyer and Tone Langengen at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a think tank, wrote in August. Net-zero policy refers to measures to reduce planet-heating pollution. Scientists say greenhouse gas emissions must go down to zero by 2050 on a net basis — in other words, after accounting for emissions released into and removed from the atmosphere — to avoid catastrophic climate change. “While polls show that an overwhelming majority believe climate change is a problem and support policies to address it, that support starts to fall once green policies come into force and people begin to experience their costs,” Langengen and Meyer said. Take two recent opinion polls. In a 2022 Pew survey covering 19 countries in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, climate change was named the top global threat. In Europe, more respondents said it was a threat to their country than at any time in the past two decades. “The results come as wildfires and extreme heat across Europe cause massive disruption to life,” the Pew researchers wrote in August last year, before another bout of deadly wildfires ravaged Greece this summer. Yet, in a survey earlier this year conducted in 29 countries by Ipsos, only 30% of respondents said they would be willing to pay more in taxes to help prevent climate change. Public attitudes “matter a lot” for reaching net-zero emissions because of the fundamental changes the transition will require, said Anna Valero, a distinguished policy fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). “What we’re talking about is large-scale structural change that will affect people’s lives,” she told CNN. From the way they heat their homes and the cars they drive, to the skills they need to do the jobs necessary for the transition, everything is in flux. Since citizens are voters, consumers and workers, they will “determine the feasibility of different things,” she added. “There’s a limit to what policymakers can do if the public don’t support their program. And there’s a limit to what businesses will do if the consumers won’t purchase those more environmentally sustainable options.” One of the most high-profile options is to switch to an electric car. But consumer demand is already waning. Earlier this month, the CEO of Volkswagen, Oliver Blume, cited a “sluggish ramp-up” of the electric vehicle (EV) market in Europe as a reason for the carmaker’s decision not to build additional battery factories for now, beyond the three plants it is already planning. “There is for the time being no business rationale for deciding on further sites,” he said in a statement. Sales data compiled by HSBC shows that carmakers in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States are having to offer discounts and cheap financing to counter weaker-than-expected demand for EVs. “In the UK, not only are the discounts on the rise, the activity seems to be spreading to more brands,” the bank’s auto analysts wrote in a note last month. Backpedaling by policymakers doesn’t help. In September, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak watered down the government’s climate strategy, delaying a ban on the sale of new gas and diesel cars by five years among other changes. Ford (F), which had hoped the government’s earlier timeline would boost demand for EVs, was sharply critical of Sunak’s decision to push it out to 2035. Sustained discounting may be needed to encourage more motorists around the world to switch to EVs. For example, in the United States, going electric still means paying a premium over the typical gas-powered model: the average price of a new EV was $51,762 in October compared with $47,936 across all vehicles, according to auto research firm Kelley Blue Book. But high upfront costs mask the fact that climate-friendly products such as EVs and heat pumps will likely save consumers money down the line. The UK government’s own independent adviser on climate strategy, the Climate Change Committee, said delaying the ban on gas-guzzling cars is likely to increase motoring costs for households. “Electric vehicles will be significantly cheaper than petrol and diesel vehicles to own and operate over their lifetimes, so any undermining of their rollout will ultimately increase costs,” the committee wrote in a report last month. The same is true of heat pumps. These use electricity to transfer heat from a source, such as the air or ground, and are standard in Scandinavian countries including Norway and Sweden, which have bitter winters. Because of their energy efficiency, heat pumps would reduce the average UK household’s heating bill by 25% and slash the average home’s carbon emissions by 75%, according to Swedish heat pump firm Aira. “There is no trade-off between (installing a heat pump), saving the planet and at the same time saving the pockets of consumers,” CEO Martin Lewerth told CNN. A heat pump is around three to seven times more expensive than a typical boiler powered by natural gas when accounting for both its price and the installation cost. In Britain, even the more generous £7,500 ($9,400) government grant that Sunak unveiled in September won’t fully offset the difference in many cases. The limited number of engineers able to install and service heat pumps is another hindrance, and also adds to costs. “If you’re living outside Scandinavia and you want a heat pump, it’s not a hassle-free experience,” Lewerth acknowledged. To address these challenges, Aira, which launched in the UK Monday, is offering monthly payment plans. The firm is also opening “Aira Academies” across Europe to retrain gas boiler installers and turn them into “clean energy experts.” “Replacing one gas boiler with an electric heat pump will basically mean taking two (combustion engine) cars off the street,” Lewerth said. “Once people understand this is actually cheaper and a better solution… then it’s self-propelling.” Conversely, delaying the implementation of net-zero measures at a time when scientists say climate action needs to be accelerated will hit consumers’ pockets harder in the long run — and cost the planet dearly. “There is no scenario in which delay is the cheaper option with climate change,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the LSE. “The cost of the transition, while significant, is nowhere near the cost of dealing with the consequences (of climate change).” In the first six months of 2023, economic losses from natural disasters, which scientists say are becoming more frequent and severe as a result of climate change, amounted to $120 billion, according to insurer Swiss Re. That’s 46% above the first-half average over the previous 10 years. In the United States alone, extreme weather events cost the economy close to $150 billion a year and disproportionately affect poor and disadvantaged communities, according to the government. And that estimate doesn’t account for loss of life or health care-related costs. Beyond the economic damage from climate change, there is also a hefty price tag associated with continued dependence on fossil fuels, including natural gas — as was painfully demonstrated by the spike in European energy bills as a result of the war in Ukraine. “If we’d invested more in renewable energy… energy bills wouldn’t have gone up so much, which disproportionately impacted on poor households,” Valero at the LSE told CNN. In a similar vein, cleaner air can have economic benefits. A 2020 study by the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, concluded that expanding London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone — the target of the recent protest in London — would meaningfully boost workforce participation and productivity by improving people’s health. So it’s clear that weaning economies off fossil fuels, while costly and disruptive in the short term, will deliver substantial returns in the long run. The job of governments, then, is to ensure that the upfront costs of reaching net zero do not fall on the poor, even if that means that “at some point rich people have to pay more,” according to Tim Jackson, the director of the Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity at the University of Surrey in the UK. “We have to think about where the burden of that cost falls now,” he told CNN. “It’s clear it shouldn’t fall on the poorest. That means that if there are costs… even if these are investment costs with returns later on, then to some extent they should fall on people who can afford to pay them.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/economy/what-150-billion-climate-change-damage-looks-like/index.html,Climate change is costing the US $150 billion a year. Here’s what that looks like,11-30-2023,"Every three weeks, the United States experiences an extreme weather event that produces $1 billion worth of damage, according to the latest US National Climate Assessment report, released earlier this month. Compare that to 40 years ago, ...","Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN","Every three weeks, the United States experiences an extreme weather event that produces $1 billion worth of damage, according to the latest US National Climate Assessment report, released earlier this month. Compare that to 40 years ago, when extreme weather episodes that cost an inflation-adjusted $1 billion happened once every four months on average. As of November 8, there have been 25 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That exceeds last year’s count — even without data from the last two months of the year. In total, extreme weather events cost the US $150 billion per year, due to direct impacts such as infrastructure damage, worker injuries and agricultural losses, the authors of the report estimate. And the cost of extreme weather events is expected to grow in the near term with a projected rise in sea levels and temperatures, the report states. Included in this year’s tally are the devastating wildfires that took place in Hawaii over the summer. The damage from the wildfires, which took the lives of over 100 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, cost $5.6 billion, according to an estimate from the National Centers for Environmental Information, a division of NOAA. There are also important economic implications. For instance, the authors of the report cited separate research published in April by MIT’s Center for Real Estate, which found that property damage from hurricanes can result in higher mortgage delinquency rates as property owners become more financially stressed. The authors also cited research that found flooding and rising sea levels lower home prices and property values as more people relocate to areas that are less prone to flooding. Hurricanes in the United States can also strain government budgets since they tend to lead to substantially higher social safety net disbursements, including unemployment insurance and public medical payments, according to research published in 2017 by Tatyana Deryugina, a finance professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The National Climate Assessment report’s estimate of the total annual cost of climate change in the United States takes those factors into account. It does not, however, take into account loss of life and health care-related costs. It may be hard to appreciate the value of $150 billion without anything to compare it to. That’s why CNN sought to find some meaningful examples. The $150 billion annual cost of extreme weather in the damage to the US is:"

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season ends on Thursday as one of the busiest on record, with a twist: Most of its storms veered into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. But with El Niño expected to end next year and global temperatures on the rise, forecasters say there’s “high potential” for an even more active hurricane season in 2024 and uncertainty around what that could mean for the United States. Record-high ocean temperatures this season ushered in above-average tropical activity and neutralized the effectiveness of a strengthening El Niño, which typically inhibits storm development in the Atlantic by ripping them apart with hostile upper level winds. By season’s end, 20 named storms, including seven hurricanes, came to life. Fortunately, only a fraction of these storms unleashed their fury on land. Three Atlantic storms made landfall in the US: Harold, Idalia and Ophelia. Idalia was the only hurricane to hit the US this year when it slammed Florida as a powerful Category 3 hurricane in August, becoming the strongest storm to strike the state’s Big Bend region in more than 125 years. The season’s 20 named storms were the fourth-most in a single year since 1950, according to NOAA. Only the hyperactive hurricane seasons of 2020, 2005 and 2021 had more. Fourteen named storms develop during an average hurricane season in the Atlantic, but when El Niño is strong, the number of named storms is typically lower. “The Atlantic basin produced the most named storms of any El Niño influenced year in the modern record,” Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center said in a news release. Extremely warm ocean water also provided fuel for rapid intensification, causing a few storms – including Idalia and Hurricane Lee – to explode in strength. Lee maxed out as a rare Category 5 hurricane in the open Atlantic after its winds increased a staggering 85 mph in 24 hours. Since the season was able to achieve so much tropical activity despite El Niño’s best efforts to stifle development, it’s remarkable that most of these storms did not impact land. When storms develop in the tropical Atlantic, it’s the strength of the Azores High – a large, semi-permanent area of high pressure in the Atlantic off the northwestern coast of Africa – that acts like a force field, either pushing storms west toward the US or pulling them away toward the open Atlantic. “When you have a really strong high, storms tend to just keep trekking to the west or to the west-northwest into the Caribbean or through the Bahamas and into Florida or up the East Coast,” Brian McNoldy, a senior research scientist at the University of Miami, told CNN. But that wasn’t the case this season, since the high pressure was quite weak due in part to record-high ocean temperatures, according to McNoldy. So, many of the storms that developed out in the tropical Atlantic followed the weakness in the high pressure and turned north, then moved northeast and deeper out to sea. “Just that one ingredient (the record-warm water) helped to make for a more active hurricane season, but it also helped to keep that activity away from land,” McNoldy explained. Hurricane experts say it’s too early to know whether so many storms will dodge land next Atlantic hurricane season, but at least one thing is clear for the 2024 season: El Niño isn’t sticking around. “The confidence that we’re not going to have El Niño next hurricane season is pretty high, especially by August or September,” Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University, told CNN. A strong El Niño is unable to maintain its strength indefinitely and typically transitions to a neutral pattern or even a weak La Niña in the following year. Without El Niño in place to help limit storms, the template for next hurricane season could look quite different. “With El Niño going away, certainly the potential is there for an above normal season – a relatively high potential,” Klotzbach said. “If we hadn’t had an El Niño (this year) we certainly could have seen a season on par with 2020 or 2005.” But El Niño isn’t the only factor that could shift next year. “The part we don’t really have a clue about yet is how warm the Atlantic will be,” McNoldy said. Even if the fate of next year’s ocean temperatures remains uncertain, global temperatures are still rising because of human-caused climate change and will continue to put oceans at risk of warming. Given the uncertainty in ocean temperatures next year, the ultimate strength of the Azores High and its ability to steer storms toward the US is also a “huge question mark,” according to Klotzbach. “We’ll see what transpires next year, but certainly, it has the potential to be quite interesting,” Klotzbach said. The 2023 Eastern Pacific hurricane season also ends on Thursday and had several impactful storms, including two of the strongest hurricanes to make landfall on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The season’s 17 named storms were busier than average. Of those storms, 10 became hurricanes and several experienced explosive rapid intensification. Hurricane Otis was the most extreme example. Otis strengthened by an astounding 115 mph in 24 hours all the way up to its devastating Category 5 hurricane landfall in Acapulco, Mexico. Otis was the strongest Pacific storm to ever strike Mexico and came just two weeks after Category 4 Hurricane Lidia made landfall just south of Puerto Vallarta as another one of Pacific Mexico’s strongest storms. Hurricane Hilary went through a period of rapid intensification which helped the storm maintain enough strength to track across California as a tropical storm – the state’s first since 1997. Hilary unloaded a deluge of rainfall that broke records for tropical rainfall in a few states and caused extreme flooding that lingered for months in one of the driest places on Earth. Earlier in the season, Hurricane Dora underwent rapid intensification as it tracked south of Hawaii and contributed to a strong wind event that helped spark the catastrophic Lahaina Fire, the deadliest fire on US soil in more than 100 years."

Canada burned, the US Southwest boiled, a Libyan city was swept away by floods and global heat was, as one scientist said, “gobsmackingly bananas.” Climate records fell like dominoes, and more are predicted — it is all but certain that 2023 will be the hottest in recorded history. And yet, even as the climate crisis inserts itself viscerally into people’s lives, experts say the year has seen alarming backsliding on climate action. Green policies have been watered down, huge new oil and gas projects have been greenlit and coal has had something of a resurgence. A slew of new reports showed countries are wildly off track on limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Instead, the world is on course for warming of up to a catastrophic 2.9 degrees, according to the United Nations Environment Programme — and that’s even if current climate policies are met. As countries gather in Dubai for the UN’s COP28 climate summit, there are “high expectations,” said Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International. “At the same time, we are seeing much lower commitment from countries.” They are “backtracking,” he told CNN. While one year alone cannot determine the success or failure of global climate action, said Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the non-profit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, “the world is still not treating this as an emergency, and that’s the fundamental problem.” Fossil fuels had a strong year in 2023, with several major projects approved, despite a warning from the IEA two years ago that there can be no more investment into new fossil fuel projects if the world is to meet international climate goals. “If you’re expanding fossil fuels, you are backtracking,” said Singh. Yet in March, the Biden administration approved the massive and controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska. The area to be drilled holds 600 million barrels of oil, enough to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-heating pollution, according to the administration’s figures. That’s equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads. The decision “moved us in the opposite direction of our national climate goals” Erik Grafe, an attorney for environmental law group Earthjustice, said in a statement at the time. On the other side of the Atlantic, the UK announced plans for an expansion of oil and gas in the North Sea in July. The government pledged to grant hundreds of new drilling licenses, in a move one climate advocate described as sending “a wrecking ball through the UK’s climate commitments.” Fossil fuel expansion by wealthy countries is set to continue long into the future. Just five developed countries — the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Norway — are responsible for 51% of oil and gas expansion planned between 2023 and 2050, according to a September report from campaign group Oil Change International. “If this oil and gas expansion is allowed to proceed, it would lock in climate chaos and an unlivable future,” the report noted. An unexpected battle in Europe in early spring over a ban on the sale of new gas and diesel powered cars set the tone for a fraught year for getting new climate policy on the books The bloc’s law had seemed like a done deal, but Germany objected at the last minute, and added a loophole that would allow the sale of combustion engine cars beyond the 2035 deadline — as long as they run on synthetic fuels. It sent worrying signals about climate backtracking, said Elisa Giannelli, a senior policy advisor at climate think tank E3G. “It’s not just about cars,” she told CNN in March. “It’s about the political signals that that [dispute] sends.” Across Europe, there has been pushback on green plans. An attempt in Germany to introduce a law to replace fossil fuel-powered heating systems with more efficient systems that can be run on renewable energy was watered down after widespread opposition was stoked in part by the far right. In the UK, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a dilution of climate pledges in September. The government’s own independent climate advisory body responded by saying it “made meeting future targets harder.” While many countries insist they are still committed to net zero by 2050 — meaning they plan to﻿ remove at least as much planet-warming pollution from the atmosphere as they produce — “targets are only valuable if they are followed up with implementation,” said Joeri Rogelj, a climate professor at Imperial College London. And “in terms of implementation … there is definitely a backsliding,” he told CNN. Global consumption of coal — the single biggest contributor to climate change — reached an all-time high in 2022, and demand is set to remain near record levels this year, according to the IEA. In the first half of 2023, China was approving new coal projects at a rate equivalent to two large coal plants every week, according to an analysis from Global Energy Monitor. This coal “spree,” as the report called it, was partly triggered by concerns over power shortages during blistering heat waves. China has pledged to peak emissions by 2030 and while the country has made giant strides on renewable energy, experts say its continued reliance on coal threatens its climate progress. “China is making the path towards its energy transition and climate commitments more complicated and costly,” Flora Champenois, co-author of the report and research analyst at GEM, said in a statement. It’s not just China. The US may have reduced its domestic coal consumption, but it has ramped up exports. In the first eight months of this year, US thermal coal exports reached their highest level since 2018, driven by demand from Asia. And in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, some countries have turned to coal in the scramble to replace Russian oil and gas. Germany temporarily reopened coal plants and in October, the government approved bringing coal plants back online over winter to avoid shortages. Experts say this scramble for coal — even if short term — has also strained relations between the West and the Global South. “The first time that the developed world has a bit of a challenge, they immediately backtrack and they say ‘oh, because it’s exceptional, we’re going to reopen coal-fired power plants,’” Rogelj said. Big oil companies made eye-popping profits in 2022. BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total pulled in a record $199.3 billion that year as they benefited from soaring oil and gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the windfall did not translate into huge boosts for clean energy plans. Instead, many announced expansion of fossil fuels and, for some, a dialing down of green pledges. BP scaled back the ambition of a commitment it had made only three years ago to slash oil and gas production by 40% by 2030. In February, it announced it would instead aim for a roughly 25% reduction by the end of the decade. Despite record profits, Shell announced in February that it would keep renewables spending steady, despite having increased it in previous years. And at a June conference, Exxon head Darren Woods said he aimed to double the amount of oil produced from the company’s US shale projects over five years. The company also dropped a years-long project to develop fuel from algae, previously a much-touted part of its green ambitions. The three companies maintain they are committed to the clean-energy transition. BP did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, but in a February statement, then CEO Bernard Looney said: “We need continuing near-term investment into today’s energy system — which depends on oil and gas — to meet today’s demands and to make sure the transition is an orderly one.” A Shell spokesperson told CNN “global energy demand will continue to grow and be met by different types of energy, including oil and gas,” and that Shell “aims to play its part in a balanced energy transition, where the world achieves net-zero emissions.” An Exxon spokesperson said the company was “embracing” the challenge to reach net zero. “We’re doing our part by investing $17 billion in lower-emission initiatives through 2027.” But according to a November IEA report, the oil and gas industry must rapidly scale up its ambitions. Around 50% of its total capital spending needs to go toward clean energy projects by 2030, according to the report. At the moment, they commit just 2.5%. “The oil and gas industry is facing a moment of truth at COP28 in Dubai,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement. “With the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible.” It would be a mistake to suggest everything is going in the wrong direction, Guilanpour said. “You need to think about trajectories, and on those trajectories, you’re going to get bumps in the road.” The relationship between the US and China has long been bumpy, but its cooperation on climate change has been a glimmer of hope. In mid-November, the countries pledged a major ramp-up in renewable energy, and agreed to economy-wide reduction of all greenhouse gases — not just carbon dioxide — the first time China officially stated its intent to do so. While 2023 did see backsliding, the long-term pathway is heading in the right direction — albeit much too slowly, said Claire Fyson, co-head of the climate policy team at Climate Analytics, a climate science and policy institute. Ultimately, the momentum is in favor of a green transition, she told CNN. “In spite of policy rollbacks in many places, the economics just win out,” Fyson told CNN, pointing to the acceleration in renewables like wind and solar. But, she added, “we’re still in very dangerous territory.” CNN’s Ella Nilsen, Ivana Kottasová and Nectar Gan contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","King Charles III told world leaders Friday that the warning signs of the climate crisis are being ignored and that the world is heading for “dangerous uncharted territory,” with devastating consequences for lives and livelihoods. Delivering an opening address to delegates at the World Climate Action Summit, part of the COP28 summit in Dubai, the King said he prayed “with all my heart that COP28 will be a critical turning point towards genuine transformational action.” “Some important progress has been made but it worries me greatly that we remain so dreadfully far off track,” he said, adding, “we are taking the natural world outside balanced norms and limits and into dangerous uncharted territory.” Referring to this year’s climate change-fueled extreme weather, including Canada’s unprecedented wildfire season, deadly flooding in Pakistan and Bangladesh and catastrophic drought in East Africa, the King told delegates that the “hope of the world” rested on decisions taken at the summit. “We are carrying out a vast, frightening experiment of changing every ecological condition all at once as a pace that far outstrips nature’s ability to cope,” he said. The King called for a series of measures, including a ramp-up of public and private finance, to tackle the climate crisis and rapidly increase renewable energy. “In 2050, our grandchildren won’t be asking what we said, they will be living with the consequences of what we did or didn’t do,” he said. “The Earth does not belong to us, we belong to the Earth,” he added. Friday marked the King’s first big speech on climate change since he became monarch last year. The King did not attend last year’s COP27 summit in Egypt, after the then UK Prime Minister, Liz Truss advised him against going. CNN understood at the time that, the monarch and government jointly agreed that the climate summit wasn’t the right occasion for the King’s first trip overseas as sovereign. UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who has already spoken at the ceremony, announced a $30 billion green investment fund, “designed to bridge the climate finance gap.” Developing nations have long pushed the rich world to channel more financing to the global south to help it make the green transition. He spoke in Dubai, where the UAE is hosting the talks. After a year of record global temperatures, fueling deadly extreme weather, the pressure is high at COP28 for leaders to make ambitious progress on tackling the climate crisis. But countries still remain divided about the role fossil fuels, the main driver of climate change, will play in the future. COP28, which opened Thursday, started with a significant development as countries formally adopted a damage fund, decades in the making, to help nations hit hardest by the climate crisis. Among countries making immediate commitments were the United Arab Emirates and Germany, both of which pledged $100 million, and the UK, which announced £60million, part of which will be used for “other arrangements,” according to the news release. The US announced a commitment of $17.5 million, which some experts and advocacy groups said was “embarrassing.” On Friday, leaders of 134 countries — which together produce 70% of the world’s food — including the US, the European Union and Brazil, signed a declaration pledging to include food in their climate change plans by 2025. It marks the first time a COP summit leaders’ declaration has focused on food and the climate crisis. Food systems are responsible for around a third of global planet-warming pollution. At the same time, agriculture is increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events, which climate change is making more frequent and more intense. Ani Dasgupta, CEO of the international climate nonprofit World Resources Institute, called the pledge a “big deal.” It sends “a powerful signal” that “we can only keep the 1.5 degree goal in sight if we act fast to shift the global food system,” he said in a statement. But others said that, while the pledge was welcome, it was too vague. It “doesn’t set out how governments will tackle food emissions,” Patty Fong, Program Director at the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, said in a statement. World leaders including India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazil’s President Lula Da Silva and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak are addressing delegates Friday at the talks in Dubai. CNN’s Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Angela Dewan and Ella Nilsen contributed reporting"

","Nicole Chavez, CNN","Black Americans living in Southeastern states are more likely to be impacted by extreme heat, hurricanes and flooding than the overall population, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Researchers compared the location of some Black communities with analyses showing climate hazards, like wildfires, extreme heat, hurricanes and flooding. They examined 11 US southeastern states as well as the Baltimore and New Orleans metropolitan areas. Those cities were chosen based “on their diverse populations, history of redlining and segregation, and geographic locations with a susceptibility to flooding,” the report said. Black communities in the Southeastern states are 1.4 times more likely to be exposed to extreme heat than the overall population, the report said. They are also 1.8 times more likely than the overall US population to experience hurricanes – that’s because there’s an elevated risk of hurricanes in the Gulf and Atlantic coast, where the Black population is more concentrated, according to the analysis. By 2050, nearly 17% of Black-owned homes could be at risk of storm damage from hurricanes or tropical storms in those states, compared to 9.7% of all residential property, the analysis found. The report also found Black communities in the Southeast were at 9.9% risk of storm damage in 2020 while all residential property had a 5.6% risk of storm damage. When it comes to coastal and river flooding in the greater Southeast, Black residents are 1.6 times more likely than the US population in the same area to experience a 1-in-100-year flooding event, the report says. Property damage from hurricanes could threaten the ability of Black Americans to transfer generational wealth and climate change could exacerbate preexisting economic inequities, the authors wrote in their analysis. The authors also said climate change could be an opportunity to address inequities. “Climate change may create significant physical risks for Black populations in the United States, but it could create opportunities to address existing racial gaps, too,” the authors wrote. They suggest the public and private sectors can consider increasing education around the impacts of climate change on communities, engaging leaders in the Black community when states plan for “climate adaptation and transition to a lower carbon economy,” and ensure Black entrepreneurs have equitable access to finance and opportunities to be part of innovation hubs supporting a transition to a green economy. An estimated nearly 47 million people living in the US identify as Black or African American, according to the US Census."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","The Biden administration has finalized a rule to significantly cut the US oil and gas industry’s emissions of methane, a powerful planet-warming gas that scientists and climate advocacy groups have pressed nations to rapidly reduce as global temperature soars. The announcement came amid a wave of commitments at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai on Saturday, including a pledge from at least 117 countries to triple renewable energy by 2030. Vice President Kamala Harris also announced the US was committing another $3 billion to global climate action. Methane, the main component of natural gas and a byproduct of fossil fuel drilling, is a potent source of climate pollution with more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide during its first two decades in the atmosphere. The oil and gas industry is one of the main sources of global methane emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. The new US rule, which will be implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to slash methane emissions by nearly 80% through 2038, compared to what they would have been without the rule. The EPA estimates it will stop about 58 million tons of methane from escaping into the atmosphere during that period – the equivalent of taking more than 300 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year. The rule will crack down on methane leaks from industry in several ways. In a major new development, it will end routine flaring of the natural gas that is a byproduct of drilling oil wells and will phase in a requirement for that gas to be captured instead of burned. The rule will also require stringent leak monitoring of oil and gas wells and compressors, and cut down on leaks from equipment like pumps, storage tanks and controllers. It will also rely on independent, third-party monitoring – using satellites and other remote-sensing technology – to find very large methane leaks. EPA Administrator Michael Regan and White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi unveiled the rule at COP28 on Saturday – a day where cutting methane emissions was a major theme and other multi-lateral announcements were made. Regan said the US rule signified “strong action” from the Biden administration by “significantly slashing methane emissions.” The US is the world’s largest oil producer, drilling and selling 21% of the world’s oil last year. “From mobilizing billions in investment to plug orphaned wells, patch leaky pipes, and reclaim abandoned mines to setting strong standards that will cut pollution from the oil and gas sector, the Biden-Harris Administration is putting the full weight of the federal government into slashing harmful methane pollution,” Zaidi added in a statement. Speaking to CNN at COP28, Zaidi reiterated the need for accountability and data on methane emissions is key to enforcement. “In addition to commitments and transparency, we’ve got to get the receipts – make sure we’re making the progress we need to make,” Zaidi said. Methane emissions surged in recent years, to the surprise of scientists and energy experts, who are now advocating for capping leaks and ending flaring and venting as easy ways to pump the brakes on the pace of global warming. Pollution experts and climate advocates told CNN there is plenty of incentive for oil and gas companies to fix the leaks and stop most flaring, since it ultimately means they can pollute less while selling more oil and gas. “There’s a lot of opportunity,” Carrie Jenks, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental & Energy Law Program, told CNN. “Companies should want to reduce their leaks because that’s more product. All the incentives should align here.” The EPA’s plan to end routine flaring is a major step forward, said Jon Goldstein, senior director for regulatory and legislative affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, who focuses on methane pollution. “The latest science is showing that flares are not just sources of waste, they’re also large sources of pollution because they’re just not working right,” Goldstein said. “The easiest way to stop that pollution is to stop sending it to flares in the first place. It doesn’t seem logical, why are you burning off this product you can sell?” Fifty major oil and gas companies, including Exxon and Saudi Aramco, signed a pledge on Saturday to cut their methane emissions by the end of the decade, according to an announcement by COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber and the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund. The new Oil and Gas Compact commits each company to reducing their methane intensity by around 80 to 90% by 2030. Recent studies from the EDF suggest oil and gas operations worldwide have a methane intensity of around 2 to 3% – this is roughly how much methane gas is released during drilling, venting or flaring, or in pipeline and compressor leaks. The companies are committing to cutting that methane intensity percentage to 0.2% by 2030. The agreement also commits the companies to third-party verification that they are cracking down on leaks or improper flaring, following international standards set by the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, according to EDF president Fred Krupp. “Without an iota of hype, this compact is the biggest thing that will reduce temperatures on the planet in decades,” Krupp said in a statement. Because of methane’s potency, scientists have emphasized in recent years that swiftly cutting methane emissions is key to limiting the climate crisis. Rapid and large-scale efforts to slash human-caused methane emissions could slow global heating by as much as 30%, according to an EDF analysis. Others were critical of the announcement as not being ambitious enough. Murray Worthy, a senior oil and gas researcher at Zero Carbon Analytics, noted that it doesn’t go further than commitments from previous years, and that “industry has yet to deliver” on those promises. “Most importantly it doesn’t require companies to deal with the main cause of emissions from fossil fuels, which is burning them,” Worthy said in a statement. Later in the day Saturday, a group of organizations led by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the United Nations announced it will launch a new program to ensure the 50 oil companies are following through on those promises to reduce methane leaks from their operations. “The better we can measure problems like greenhouse gas emissions, the better we can manage them,” said Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire philanthropist and former mayor of New York City. Al Jaber praised the pledge and said it was aligned with the goal to keep the Paris Agreement goal within reach. But he also said “it is not enough.” “I say with full passion and conviction, much more can be done,” he said. Correction: The oil and gas industry is one of the main sources of global methane emissions.

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Sultan Al Jaber, the oil executive who is leading the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, sent shockwaves through the gathering by claiming in the days before the UN-backed talks that there is “no science” that says phasing out fossil fuels is necessary to keep global warming under a critical threshold — comments Al Jaber said were misinterpreted. Al Jaber held a surprise news conference Monday where he fiercely defended his commitment to climate science, after an increasing number of scientists and advocates expressed alarm at the comments and concern for the direction of the talks. The future role of fossil fuels is one of the most controversial issues countries are grappling with at the COP28 climate summit. While some are pushing for a “phase-out,” others are calling for the weaker language of a “phase-down.” Scientific reports have shown that fossil fuels must be rapidly slashed to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius﻿ — the goal of the Paris climate agreement, and a threshold above which scientists warn it will be more difficult for humans and ecosystems to adapt. Al Jaber made the remarks during the She Changes Climate panel event on November 21, which came to light on Sunday in a story published by the Guardian, and in video that CNN has reviewed. Al Jaber was asked by Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and current chair of the Elders Group, an independent group of global leaders, if he would lead on phasing out fossil fuels. In his response, Al Jaber told Robinson, “there is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5.” He said he had expected to come to the She Changes Climate meeting to have a “sober and mature conversation” and was not “signing up to any discussion that is alarmist.” He continued that the 1.5-degree goal was his “north star,” and a phase-down and phase-out of fossil fuel was “inevitable” but “we need to be real, serious and pragmatic about it.” In an increasingly fractious series of responses to Robinson pushing him on the point, Al Jaber asked her “please, help me, show me a roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuels that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves.” Al Jaber’s presidency of the COP28 summit has been controversial. The Emirati businessman is the UAE’s climate envoy and chairs the board of directors of its renewables company, but he also heads the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). Al Jaber told reporters Monday, “I have always been very clear on the fact that we are making sure that everything we do is centered around the science.” “I honestly think there is some confusion out there, and misrepresentation and misinterpretation,” he said, adding, “I have said over and over that the phase down and the phase out of fossil fuel is inevitable. In fact, it is essential … it needs to be orderly, fair, just and responsible.” A spokesperson for the COP28 team told CNN in a statement on Sunday “this story is just another attempt to undermine the Presidency’s agenda, which has been clear and transparent and backed by tangible achievements by the COP President and his team.” “The COP President is clear that phasing down and out of fossil fuels is inevitable and that we must keep 1.5C within reach,” adding, “we are excited with the progress we have made so far and for the delivery of an ambitious (global stocktake) decision. Attempts to undermine this will not soften our resolve.” Fossil fuels are the main driver of the climate crisis and as the world continues to burn oil, coal and gas, global temperatures are soaring to unprecedented levels. This year has seen record global heat, which has driven deadly extreme weather events. Fossil fuel production in 2030 is expected to be more than double what would be necessary to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees, a recent report from several scientific institutions, including the UN Environment Programme, found. That report used scenarios laid out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) to reach its conclusion. “If the IPCC and IEA do not count as science then I don’t know what does,” said Ploy Achakulwisut, climate researcher at the Stockholm Environment Institute and one of the authors on the report. She told CNN it concluded “that all fossil fuels have to be phased out especially if carbon dioxide removal and carbon capture and storage measures fail to scale.” Carbon capture refers to a set of techniques that aim to remove carbon pollution from the the air and to capture what’s being produced from power plants and other polluting facilities. While some argue carbon capture will be an important tool for reducing planet-heating pollution, others argue these technologies are expensive, unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use. Scientists and climate groups heavily criticized Al Jaber’s comments. Romain Ioualalen, global policy lead at non-profit Oil Change International, said in a statement Al Jaber’s statements during the panel discussion were “alarming,” “science-denying” and “raise deep concerns about the Presidency’s capacity to lead the UN climate talks.” Joeri Rogelj, a climate professor at Imperial College London, said he strongly recommended Al Jaber revisit the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “That report, approved unanimously by 195 countries including the UAE, shows a variety of ways to limit warming to 1.5°C — all of which indicate a de facto phase out of fossil fuels in the first half of the century. Will that take the world back to the caves? Absolutely not,” he said in a statement. Mohamed Adow, director of climate think tank Power Shift Africa, said Al Jaber’s remarks were a “wake up call” to the world and COP28 negotiators. “They are not going to get any help from the COP Presidency in delivering a strong outcome on a fossil fuel phase out,” he said in a statement. This COP summit will conclude the first global stocktake, where countries will assess their progress on climate action progress and work out how to get the world on track to limiting catastrophic global warming. This story has been updated with additional information. CNN’s Angela Dewan and Rachel Ramirez contributed reporting."

And scientists say the steady climb of global sea level will continue for many decades as temperatures crank higher. The analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit climate research group, illustrates the risk if countries fail to halt the planet’s precipitous warming trend. A recent UN report showed the world is currently on track to warm up to 2.9 degrees. Using peer-reviewed sea level rise projections and local elevation from Climate Central’s models, the findings show compelling visuals that paint a stark contrast between the world as we know it and our high-tide future, if the planet warms to 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. “Decisions made at COP28 will shape the long-term future of Earth’s coast cities, including Dubai,” said Benjamin Strauss, chief scientist and CEO of Climate Central. Climate scientists have reported the world is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, and it’s on track to breach 1.5 degrees of warming in the coming years — a critical threshold beyond which scientists say humans and ecosystems will struggle to adapt. In 2015, at COP21 in Paris, more than 190 countries approved the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably to 1.5 degrees. The world’s current trajectory of up to 2.9 degrees could be unlivable for coastal communities, low-lying countries and small island states around the world. “The survival of these places and their heritage will depend on whether the government and industry leaders can agree to cut carbon pollution sharply enough and fast enough to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius degrees,” Strauss said. 2023 is already set to be the hottest year on record, according to a report released Thursday by the World Meteorological Organization. Each month from June through October set new global monthly temperatures records by wide margins, while ocean temperatures also hit record highs. These blistering global temperatures are causing glaciers and ice sheets to melt at alarming rates, which adds a significant amount of water to Earth’s oceans. Even Antarctica, the most isolated continent on the planet, is seeing unprecedented melting events. The melting of some large glaciers is now potentially unavoidable and could pose devastating implications for sea level rise globally. Roughly 385 million people currently live in areas that will be eventually inundated by ocean water at high tide, even if planet-warming pollution is drastically reduced, according to Climate Central. If we limit warming to 1.5 degrees, sea level rise would still affect land inhabited by 510 million people today. But if the planet breaches 3 degrees, the high-tide line could encroach above land where more than 800 million people live, a recent study found. But while these scenarios could be centuries away, scientists say with every fraction of a degree of warming, the consequences of climate change worsen. At COP28, global leaders will discuss how to ramp down planet-warming fossil fuels to prevent the increasing likelihood of an underwater future. This year’s climate talks will also be the first time countries will be negotiating with a new scorecard showing how seriously off-track they are on their climate targets — and how the window to slash climate pollution is “rapidly narrowing.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/03/politics/harris-climate-younger-voters/index.html,Harris’ climate conference visit marks her latest appeal to crucial younger voters,12/03/2023,"                                                 Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to reassert her role in the upcoming presidential election during a global climate summit over the weekend, hoping to mobilize young voters animated by tackling climate change.                                             ","Priscilla Alvarez, CNN","Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to reassert her role in the upcoming presidential election during a global climate summit over the weekend, hoping to mobilize young voters animated by tackling climate change. Harris directly addressed young leaders in her remarks at the COP28 climate conference Saturday, saying: “As vice president I have had the privilege to meet with young climate leaders from across the United States and around the world. No matter where they come from, these young leaders have something in common. They understand the urgency of this moment. And they fight with conviction, knowing that we still have time to make a difference. So let us all share in their sense of urgency and their optimism.” It’s a trend that’s taken shape over the course of the last year as the Biden campaign seeks to capitalize on the vice president’s influence among young voters. Harris’ attendance at COP28, while last minute and heavily focused on the war between Israel and Hamas, is in line with her recent steps to ramp up public messaging on climate and her own experience on the issue dating to her years as district attorney in San Francisco. Over recent months, Harris has hit the road to elevate the issues the administration is focused on, such as abortion access, gun violence, protecting voting rights and student debt relief. “We believe her when she tells us that she’s fighting for us, and that’s the appeal of Vice President Harris. She can connect on a personal level with young people who have these interactions,” said Jack Lobel, the national press secretary for Voters of Tomorrow, a youth-led organization focused on mobilizing young voters. But it remains to be seen whether Harris can motivate those key constituencies to back President Joe Biden in 2024. Polling nationally and in battleground states alike suggests Biden, 81, is weak with young voters, as well as with Black and other voters of color. While Biden and Harris hold similar approval ratings, Harris’ ratings among these key subgroups have varied, suggesting views of the vice president are not as deeply entrenched. Michele Weindling, political director at the youth climate group Sunrise Movement, called Harris attending COP28 “positive,” but stressed the vice president needs to be “a lot more bold.” “It’s not enough anymore to just talk about the recognition of the crisis that we’re facing,” Weindling said. “We need to hear a clear pathway forward for how she is also pressuring the president to use all of his powers at his disposal to fight the crisis, and also what she’s doing to try to encourage Congress to do the same. And I don’t think we have seen that clearly enough from her. I hope that we see more of that this coming week throughout COP and also throughout next year,” she added. Several Harris insiders have optimistically pointed to the New York Times/Siena College polls of battleground states released last month, which showed “11 percent of Ms. Harris’s would-be supporters do not back Mr. Biden, and two-thirds of them are either nonwhite or younger than 30,” according to The Times. Asked why young people should see themselves in a president who is old enough to be older than many of their grandparents, Harris was a little less formal in an exclusive interview with CNN. “It is they,” Harris said in thinking about the election winner, “who are going to either benefit from or pay the price.” Harris has also been able to connect with Gen Z voters, who are more racially diverse compared with other generations, by talking about her multicultural upbringing and becoming the nation’s first female, Black and South Asian vice president. “She’s meeting younger voters where they are and speaking directly to young audiences,” a source close to the Biden campaign told CNN. “She’ll be playing a big, big role in speaking to young audiences, to mobilizing and energizing young audiences and making the case for young voters across the country.” Harris has held more than 17 events this year focused on climate legislation passed under the Biden administration, according to a White House official. “Hitting an international summit is not an end-all, be-all for mobilizing voters. In fact, it might not even move the dial at all. But it needs to be part of the pattern of the administration showing up and expressing urgency around climate demands and taking action when they can,” said Jamal Raad, a co-founder and the former executive director of clean energy advocacy group Evergreen Action, underscoring the significance of US leadership attending COP28. Polls suggest that young voters are disappointed with the pace of actions on climate change. Asked about those concerns, senior administration officials have defended the administration, citing a list of actions, including deployment of clean energy; elements of the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes key provisions to reduce carbon emissions; and the US’ recommitment the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “I think there are legitimate areas where the movement continues to push and find opportunities for movement by the federal government, and there are definitely places that if President Biden had 60 Democrats in the United States Senate, that he would’ve passed,” another senior administration official said. “I think to the extent there are young people who have frustration with the composition of Congress not enabling the full reach of that agenda, there’s a way forward on that,” the official added. Harris, senior administration officials said, planned to speak to young leaders on climate directly. “Yes, this is a conference where heads of state are there, making some critical decisions, but again, there are those other folks – the advocates, the private sector, there’s philanthropy – and making sure that she’s speaking to those young leaders and they have a role at this table is going to be part of that,” a senior administration official said. CNN’s Camila DeChalus, Ella Nilsen and Sam Fossum contributed to this report."

","Allison Chinchar and Sara Tonks, CNN","Multiple atmospheric rivers are expected to roll across the northwestern US over the next few days, bringing heavy rain, feet of snow and strong winds. In total, more than half a dozen western states are under some type of winter weather alert Sunday, as these atmospheric rivers spread from Washington and Oregon eastward into Colorado and Wyoming. An atmospheric river (AR) is a plume of moisture that helps carry saturated air from the tropics to higher latitudes, delivering unrelenting rain or snow. “The Winter Storm Severity Index (WSSI) shows major Impacts are possible in the highest elevations of the Pacific Northwest and the Rockies, likely causing hazardous to even impossible travel conditions in these impacted areas,” the Weather Prediction Center cautioned. At least 5 to 10 inches of rainfall is forecast along the coastal areas of Oregon, Washington and northwestern California. For higher elevations, as much as 1 to 3 feet of snow is expected to accumulate through the weekend. An avalanche warning has been issued for areas of Oregon and Washington including Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes, the West Slopes of the southern Washington Cascades, and Mt Hood. “Very dangerous avalanche conditions will develop over the next 24 hours,” the Northwest Avalanche Center in Seattle said. “Travel in avalanche terrain in not recommended.” A sequence of back-to-back atmospheric rivers, called an AR family, began Saturday and will continue across this region through Wednesday without much of a break period in between systems. This lack of recovery time will lead to an increased risk for flooding. “In scenarios where we see multiple atmospheric rivers move onshore in the form of a family, hydrologic impacts tend to be exacerbated due to the lack of time for rivers and soils to recede back to baseline,” said Chad Hecht, research and operations meteorologist at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at UC San Diego. A level 4 out of 5 AR event is forecast to hit roughly the entire coastline of Oregon. Not all atmospheric river events are bad. In fact, AR event levels 1 and 2 are considered mostly beneficial rains and are much needed across the western US to build water supply levels. But AR event levels 4 and 5 are more hazardous than they are beneficial as the risk for flooding and travel dangers outweighs the benefits. “Given enhanced rainfall during the weekend, the soils will be more vulnerable and thus the potential for greater run-off and flooding,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “Snow levels are initially expected to be rather high, and therefore western facing slopes of the Cascades may be subject to an additional risk of flooding due to snow melt.” A slight risk for flooding, which is a level 2 out of 4, has been issued for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday across western Oregon and Washington in anticipation of the excessive rainfall amounts. Gusty winds up to 50 mph also are likely and could bring down trees and power lines."

The report was not able to count how many fossil fuel representatives are actually in attendance, though it has shown registration numbers have been increasing over the years. The findings are likely to fuel tensions at the already controversial climate summit, where the future role of fossil fuels, the main driver of the climate crisis, is shaping up to be one of the key sticking points. COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, also an oil executive, has argued the fossil fuel industry should be involved in the summit. “Let history reflect the fact that this is the presidency that made a bold choice to proactively engage with oil and gas companies,” he said during his opening remarks Thursday. CNN has reached out to the COP28 team for comment. The analysis from the coalition, which this year organized under the name Kick Big Polluters Out, looked at the provisional list of COP participants to identify registrants with self-declared ties to fossil fuel companies or organizations with fossil fuel interests or foundations owned or controlled by a fossil fuel company. It found an “unprecedented” 2,456 fossil fuel employees and representatives registered to attend COP28, significantly more than the 636 who signed up for COP27 in Egypt in 2022. This year’s analysis was made easier by the United Nations’ decision in June that for the first time it would require fossil fuel lobbyists to disclose their affiliations when registering for the summit. Fossil fuel employees and representatives received more passes to COP28 than all the delegates from the 10 most climate-vulnerable countries combined, according to the research. “The hallways and negotiating rooms of this climate conference are flooded with the largest number of fossil fuel lobbyists ever,” said Lili Fuhr, director of the fossil fuel energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law. Governments must “remain focused on delivering an outcome that supports and mandates a full phase out of fossil fuels while protecting public policy-making from fossil fuel interests,” she told CNN. “It remains our only chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 (degrees Celsius).” Some scientists and advocacy groups have expressed increasing concerns about the ambition levels of the summit after recently resurfaced comments made by Al Jaber in the run up to COP28. In a recorded panel session last month, he told participants there was “no science” that said phasing out fossil fuels was necessary to meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. After the remarks came to light on Sunday, Al Jaber fiercely defended his commitment to climate goals and science.  At a news conference Monday, he told reporters his remarks had been misinterpreted and that a phase-down and phase-out of fossil fuels was “inevitable” and “essential.” The number of fossil employees and representatives at COP summits has been increasing over the years, according to the annual report. Attendees connected to fossil fuel companies have attended COP summits at least 7,200 times over the last two decades, according to a KBPO report in November."

","Laura Paddison and Brandon Miller, CNN","The decade between 2011 and 2020 was the hottest on record for the planet’s land and oceans as the rate of climate change “surged alarmingly,” according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organization. The report, released Tuesday at the COP28 conference in Dubai, found rising concentrations of planet-heating pollution in the atmosphere fueled record land and ocean temperatures and “turbo charged” dramatic glacier loss and sea-level rise during this period. This year is also expected to be the hottest year, after six straight months of record global temperatures. Scientists have said this year’s exceptional warmth is the result of the combined effects of El Niño and human-caused climate change, which is driven by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution. A separate analysis released Monday by the Global Carbon Project found that carbon pollution from fossil fuels is on track to set a new record in 2023 – 1.1% higher than 2022 levels. WMO’s findings on the hottest decade continue a 30-year trend. “Each decade since the 1990s has been warmer than the one before it, and we see no immediate sign of this trend reversing,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. “We have to cut greenhouse gas emissions as a top and overriding priority for the planet in order to prevent climate change spiralling out of control.” While the concentration of all planet-heating gases grew over this decade, the UN agency highlighted the increase in methane as particularly concerning. “The alarming trend here is that the rate of the growth of methane almost doubled during this decade,” Elena Manaenkova, WMO’s Deputy Secretary General, said in a news conference Tuesday. Climate pollution from all fossil fuel types — coal, oil, and natural gas — increased around the world, the Global Carbon Project found, but some proved to be more dominant than others. Coal and oil emissions, for instance, have increased significantly in India and China, while the US and the EU showed strong declines in coal. Emissions from natural gas are increasing in the US, China and India, but decreasing in the EU. At the rate at which emissions are rising, researchers estimate a 50% chance of global temperatures regularly breaching 1.5 degrees Celsius in about seven years. That temperature – the goal of the Paris climate agreement, and a threshold above which scientists warn it will be more difficult for humans and ecosystems to adapt – was crossed briefly this year as warming from El Niño merged with the climate crisis. Climate shocks are threatening food security and displacing people around the world, the WMO report warned, and there is a “particularly profound transformation” taking place in the polar regions and high mountains. “We are losing the race to save our melting glaciers and ice sheets,” Taalas said. There was one piece of good news: The report found the ozone layer is on track to recovery thanks to international efforts to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals. The WMO report comes partway through the UN-backed COP28 climate summit, on the day focused on energy and industry. The future role of fossil fuels — the main driver of the climate crisis — is one of the main sticking points at COP28. “The impacts of climate change are evident all around us, but action to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels remains painfully slow,” said Pierre Friedlingstein, a professor at the University of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute. “It now looks inevitable we will overshoot the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement, and leaders meeting at COP28 will have to agree rapid cuts in fossil fuel emissions even to keep the 2°C target alive.” CNN’s Amy Cassidy contributed reporting."

Sutter,"Editor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a climate journalist and nonfiction filmmaker. He is the Ted Turner Visiting Professor of Environmental Media at the George Washington University. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion. As someone who’s been reporting on the climate crisis for more than a decade, I can say that the most insidious threat to climate action isn’t denial or apathy. It’s doubt and confusion. That’s why the news from COP28 in Dubai is so infuriating. The COP — an international peer-pressure meeting meant to avert disastrous global warming — is supposed to be a moment of resounding clarity, when world leaders come together to re-up their commitments to abandon fossil fuels and promote a future that’s, you know, livable. The message should be clear: The world can and should abandon fossil fuels as quickly as possible in favor of cleaner energy sources like wind and solar. We have the technology and the political levers we need to succeed. Instead, the COP28 talks have been mired in controversy and confusion. The United Arab Emirates, a petrostate, is hosting the talks. The COP president is Sultan Al Jaber, the head of a renewable energy company and also the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. Appointing an oil exec to run global climate negotiations is not unlike letting the NRA facilitate a symposium on gun control. No surprise, then, that Al Jaber made some, well, stupefying comments, including that abandoning fossil fuels — which, again, should be the point of these talks — risks putting us “back into caves.” He also claimed, falsely, that there is “no science” supporting a total phase-out of fossil fuels in order to meet temperature goals that are the center of the negotiations. “Please, help me, show me a roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuels that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves,” he said on November 21, in the days leading up to the COP28 summit. The remarks were part of a conversation with Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and UN special climate envoy, and were first reported by The Guardian, which posted a video of the discussion. “There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C,” he said, referencing a temperature target from the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A report issued Sunday during COP28 by Future Earth, The Earth League and The World Climate Research Programme, states that “a rapid and managed fossil fuel phase-out is required” to meet global climate goals. Al Jaber tried to walk back the comments at a press conference on Monday, saying that he respects science and that the comments were subject to “misrepresentation.” “I have said over and over that the phase-down and the phase-out of fossil fuels is inevitable,” he said. By then, however, the damage had been done. Observers are right to question Al Jaber’s intentions and the intent of this entire process. And the public could understandably be confused about whether these efforts are even worthwhile. That’s tragic, especially in light of the long and frustrating history of fossil fuel interests injecting doubt into policy conversations about the climate crisis. The broad strokes of climate science have been well understood for several decades now. But starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science. The fallout of that doubt still haunts political conversations about the climate crisis today. It leads to years and decades of stalled or flimsy action. It’s also frustrating given that the public has few opportunities to focus on global warming — and the annual COP meeting tends to be one such moment when the world pays attention. In the United States, only 35% of adults talk about the climate crisis at least occasionally, according to a 2021 survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Slightly less — 33% — hear about it at least once a week in the media. Not quite what you’d expect given that the habitability of our planet is in jeopardy. We are living with the consequences of a world we’ve warmed today — in the form of wildfires, extreme weather, searing drought and a burgeoning extinction crisis in the natural world. If there’s a silver lining to the fact that Al Jaber’s comments have been wildly distracting, and disruptive, it’s that there is some benefit to plainly observing the predicament we are in. Heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels continues to go up year after year. There are plenty of people and companies who profit from it. Perhaps calling for Al Jaber to resign is part of a short-term solution to restore the credibility of COP28 and all the COP meetings still to come. But there’s a bigger point on which there must be absolute clarity in the public mind: We must demand a total phase-out of fossil fuels. World leaders at COP28 can and should deliver on that promise. And the public must hold them to account. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the producers of the 10 New Insights In Climate Science report."

While US emissions are decreasing, a recent major federal report said it’s not happening fast enough to keep global temperatures from crossing key thresholds. Biden in 2020 vowed to end fossil fuel drilling on public lands and paused it early in his campaign. But after several legal challenges and IRA provisions requiring new oil and gas lease sales, the administration has resumed auctioning off public lands for drilling and has approved some major new oil and gas projects. Under Biden, US oil exports reached a new record this year, even surpassing exports under former President Donald Trump. Sunrise is calling on Biden to end US fossil fuel exports and is rallying against a massive proposed liquified natural gas export terminal based in Louisiana. The new Sunrise demands highlight the tightrope the president will have to navigate going into the general election – needing to persuade young people who care about the climate crisis to vote for him again, while also parrying Republican attacks on energy and gas prices. “Unambiguously, the president has done big things on climate and continues to,” White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi told CNN. “What’s clear to me is the progress he’s made makes him more hopeful and more hungry to take bigger and bolder steps in the years ahead.” Several of Sunrise’s demands are greatly expanded versions of steps Biden has already taken. For instance, Biden used the Defense Production Act to ramp up manufacturing of energy-efficient heat pumps. The Inflation Reduction Act has also directed billions of private investment into renewables, electric vehicle and battery manufacturing around the country, resulting in new factories and jobs in many states. And Biden has also used other levers of the federal government to address the health and equity impacts of climate, directing the Department of Labor to ensure employers are protecting construction and farm workers from brutal heat. “I hear the calls for accelerated action on climate and clean energy,” Zaidi said, adding, “I think there could not be a better leader to translate that into action” than Biden. Even so, recent polls have shown majorities of voters and young voters disapproving of Biden’s climate agenda. A July Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that 57% of Americans disapprove of the way Biden has handled climate policy, including 59% of voters 18-29 years old. Seventy-four percent of Democrats said they approved of how Biden had addressed the issue, but just 40% of independents and 8% of Republicans agreed. Most Americans – 71% – said they had read or heard very little about the Inflation Reduction Act, the major climate policy legislation Biden signed into law last year. Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz drew a contrast between Biden’s agenda and Republicans. “Instead of ignoring the very real threat climate change poses on Americans’ lives like MAGA Republicans do, President Biden and Democrats are tackling the crisis head on with action, including by passing the most significant climate legislation in the history of our country,” Munoz said in a statement, adding that a second Biden term would “help our country finish the job.” Sunrise leaders told CNN that while they believe there will be lots of pressure on Biden to carve out a moderate path on fossil fuels during the election, they want to see the president offer bold vision offered by the president. “This is a really clear signal to the president that you absolutely cannot win this election by appealing to the fossil fuel industry and moderates, who will never choose him over a Republican,” Michele Weindling, Sunrise political director, told CNN. “It isn’t enough to just tell us to vote because you are not a Republican – you have to give us something to fight for.” Since its founding in 2017, the Sunrise Movement has become an influential youth-led climate group. During the 2020 campaign, the group’s co-founder and former executive director Varshini Prakash helped formulate key points of Biden’s climate change policy alongside John Kerry and Gina McCarthy – who became Biden’s special presidential envoy for climate and first national climate adviser, respectively. The group also was successful in pushing the Biden administration to create the first-of-its-kind American Climate Corps, a workforce training program to prepare American youth for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience and restoration. Ahead of 2024, Sunrise’s leaders say their members are more focused on pressuring Biden to significantly slash fossil fuels. “We have a plan to organize young people in a number of swing states, particularly around the climate crisis,” Weindling said. “We have a significant amount of pressure to put onto the administration to show what we need to see from the president in order to feel mobilized to vote in this election.”"

The month was roughly 1.75 degrees warmer than pre-industrial levels, and two days soared beyond 2 degrees, worrying scientists about what this means for the planet in the coming years. The report comes as delegates from more than 150 countries are in Dubai for COP28, the UN’s annual climate summit, where the discussion over whether to phase out planet-warming fossil fuels has been heated. “The timing could not be more urgent,” Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who is not involved with the report, told CNN. “Wealthy and high-emitting countries, which have contributed the most to this record-breaking year,” she added, “have a greater responsibility to make a fair, fast and funded phase out of fossil fuels to help limit the increasing extreme weather and climate change impacts.” Scientists have said 2023’s exceptional warmth is the result of the combined effects of El Niño and human-caused climate change. A series of deadly heat waves and remarkable record-breaking temperatures have hit several continents this year, while unprecedented ocean heat blanketed much of the globe. Fall in the Northern Hemisphere this year was the warmest on record around the world “by a large margin,” according to Copernicus. November was also wetter than average across most of Europe, with Storm Ciarán bringing heavy rain and floods to many regions including Italy. As temperatures crank higher into the next year, the world appears to be on track to breach 1.5 degrees of warming on a longer-term basis in the coming years. While it’s worrisome global warming is exceeding that temperature for months at a time, scientists are particularly concerned the planet will stay above 1.5 degrees for the long term. Through 2022, Earth had warmed around 1.2 degrees — and the past few years have made it abundantly clear that the world are already feeling alarming effects of the climate crisis that many are not prepared for. A separate report released Tuesday from the World Meteorological Organization found the decade between 2011 and 2020 was the hottest on record for the planet’s land and oceans as the rate of climate change “surged alarmingly” and “turbo charged” dramatic glacier loss and sea-level rise during this period. “As long as greenhouse gas concentrations keep rising, we can’t expect different outcomes from those seen this year,” Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said. “The temperature will keep rising and so will the impacts of heatwaves and droughts.”"

More precisely, the role they should play in our rapidly warming future.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","The thorniest issue at the global climate summit in Dubai is clear: Fossil fuels. More precisely, the role they should play in our rapidly warming future. As negotiators thrash out the terms of core agreements that will emerge from COP28, the big question is whether countries will ultimately agree to a phase-out of oil, gas and coal, a phase-down — or neither. The difference between phase-out and phase-down sounds like semantics, but the ability of the world to hold back catastrophic climate change may hinge on it. While concrete definitions are hard to pin down, a phase-out generally means the world will at some point stop burning oil, gas and coal altogether and bring levels of planet-heating pollution down to zero. A phase-down, however, leaves the door open for countries to continue burning fossil fuels. It “can mean anything where the future level (of fossil fuel burning) is lower than today’s,” said Joeri Rogelj, a climate professor at Imperial College London. The word “implies a level of ambition that is less clear, and also less ambitious, than a phase-out,” he told CNN. Tensions around the terms were heightened this week in the wake of newly surfaced comments made by COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, in which he claimed there was “no science” saying a phase-out of fossil fuels is necessary to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. He told reporters Monday that his comments were misinterpreted, and a fossil fuel phase-out was “inevitable” and “essential,” but the comments sent shockwaves through the summit. More than 100 countries have pushed for the phase-out language, and dozens of scientists signed an open letter Wednesday stating that “the link between climate science and fossil fuel phase out is unequivocal.” So, if the agreement lands on phase down, will that make it even harder to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius? “In isolation, yes,” Rogelj said, “but words and context matter and it’s not black or white.” A text that agreed on a phase-down of all fossil fuels by 2050, for example, with specific targets for the decline of coal, oil and gas could be very positive, he said. The devil will be in the detail, and even if the more ambitious phase down terminology is agreed, there’s another important word to account for: “unabated.” The EU and the US, for example, have both called for a phase-out of “unabated fossil fuels.” This would mean an end to burning oil, gas or coal without capturing the planet-heating pollution before it escapes into the atmosphere, where it contributes to global warming. The “abatement” refers to carbon capture and removal — a set of techniques that are being developed to remove carbon pollution from the air and to capture what’s being produced from power plants and other polluting facilities, then storing it or reusing it. Many scientists have expressed concern that carbon capture is expensive, unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use. The world has taken so long to cut emissions that scientific bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say a limited amount of carbon capture will be needed. It is likely to be required for certain sectors, such as agriculture and aviation, for which “zero emissions does not seem possible in the coming decades,” said Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate professor at the University of Exeter in the UK. The question is, how much would be used and how effective would it need to be: If a fossil fuel plant captured 51% of its emissions, for example, would that be considered abatement? The word “is meaningless without clear quality standards,” said Lisa Fischer, a program lead at climate think tank E3G. The summit’s final agreement is expected around December 12, and experts are pushing for language to be precise, given the stakes. Clarity is essential, Fischer said. “Ambiguity now doesn’t help anyone but the fossil fuel industry.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/business/india-cop28-climate-change-intl-hnk/index.html,India’s urban population is exploding. That could have huge consequences for the planet,12/07/2023,                                                 India is burning ever greater amounts of coal and oil as it tries to meet the needs of its 1.4 billion people. But it also has huge renewable potential.                                             ,"Analysis by Diksha Madhok, CNN","Over half a century ago, India’s then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi talked about the staggering challenge for developing nations: to industrialize without harming the environment. “On the one hand the rich look askance at our continuing poverty — on the other, they warn us against their own methods,” she told a United Nations event in Stockholm in 1972, the first global conference to make the environment a major issue. “We do not wish to impoverish the environment any further and yet we cannot for a moment forget the grim poverty of large numbers of people,” she added. Her words have never been more relevant. The tension between economic growth and environmental protection is at the heart of global discussions about how to tackle the ever accelerating climate crisis. Addressing the opening session of the COP28 climate talks in Dubai on Friday, India’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, said all developing countries must be given “a fair share in the global carbon budget” — the amount of planet-warming carbon pollution the world can emit and still avoid climate catastrophe. Even though Earth is now heating up to dangerous levels, many governments around the world persist with viewing coal, oil and gas as sources of economic development, energy security and geopolitical power, the UN said this year. As a result, the world’s fossil fuel production in 2030 is set to be more than twice the amount needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the Paris climate agreement, a recent UN Environment Programme report found. One of the major contributors to that disastrous overshoot will be India, which is burning ever greater amounts of coal and oil as it tries to meet the needs of its 1.4 billion people. It plans to double domestic coal production by 2030. But even as the world’s most populous nation clings to coal with one hand, there are some signs that it is attempting to chart a more sustainable course with the other. India has made “significant investments and set ambitious targets for renewable energy,” the UNEP report said, noting that the world’s fastest growing major economy has earmarked over $4 billion toward energy transition in this year’s national budget. Other global agencies have also noted India’s growing ambitions in the pursuit of green energy. The Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a report in October that the country was “moving into a dynamic new phase in its energy development marked by a long-term net zero emissions ambition.” In 2021, Modi pledged India would achieve net zero emissions by 2070, which is still a couple of decades later than developed economies. Transforming India’s energy sector, like most things in the country, is going to be chaotic and muddled, but it will have far-reaching implications for the global energy market and the race to limit global warming. “India’s net zero by 2070 target, if met in full and on time along with all respective national targets, will take the world to 1.7 degree Celsius global average surface temperature rise by 2100,” said Siddharth Singh, energy investment analyst at the IEA. Getting there need not come at the cost of growth. Already there are “early signs of a gradually loosening link between economic development and carbon emissions,” said Singh. If the country is able to meet its pledges, its carbon emissions will fall by over 40% by 2050, even as its GDP quadruples over this period, IEA said in its report. India is the world’s third-largest energy consuming country, although its energy use and emissions per person are less than half the world average, IEA data shows. That could change rapidly. Thanks to rising incomes, energy demand has doubled since 2000, with 80% of demand still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass. Over the next three decades, the South Asian nation will see the largest energy demand growth of any country in the world, the IEA said. That superlative isn’t surprising as the country is expected to achieve some impressive economic milestones. The world’s fifth largest economy is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, analysts say, and may become only the third country with annual GDP of $10 trillion by 2035. And as it develops and modernizes, its urban population is going to shoot up, leading to a massive rise in the construction of homes, offices, shops and other buildings. “India adds the equivalent of a London to its urban population every year for the next 30 years,” said Singh. The Modi government is also trying to boost domestic manufacturing and that has unleashed a building boom, with everything from roads and bridges to ports and railways springing up around the country. This infrastructure bonanza will lead to a surge in demand for coal and steel, which are huge sources of carbon emissions. Electricity demand is also expected to skyrocket in the coming years because of factors ranging from improved standards of living to climate change. The latter has been fueling deadly heatwaves across India, and as a result, air conditioner ownership is set to see a sharp spike in the coming years. By 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners is set to exceed the total energy consumption in the whole of Africa today, the IEA said this year. Coal accounts for almost 70% of the country’s electricity generation and is not likely to change in the near future. The future role of fossil fuels is one of the most controversial issues nations are grappling with at COP28. While some are pushing for a “phase-out,” others are calling for the weaker language of a “phase-down.” India has said that the former option is not feasible at the moment. “We cannot phase out fossil fuels unless we have nuclear or until [energy] storage becomes viable,” India’s power minister R.K. Singh said last week, just days after he had said that the country won’t be rushed into reducing its use of coal. “We are not going to do this … we are not going to compromise on availability of power for our growth, even if it requires that we add coal-based capacity,” the minister said in November. Still, the fact that India is developing at this point in history gives it a unique opportunity not to repeat the climate sins of wealthier nations. The country was a reluctant signatory to the Paris climate accord in 2015, when more than 190 countries pledged to limit the precipitous rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with a preferred goal of 1.5 degrees. Those pledges haven’t yet been delivered. The world is careening toward nearly 3 degrees of global warming, even if current climate policies are met, the United Nations has warned. The Modi government has set ambitious goals. It has promised that renewable energy will fulfil 50% of India’s energy requirements by the end of this decade. The government also set a target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel electricity generating capacity by that period — up from about 173 GW last year. India has launched an incentive program to boost domestic manufacturing in critical sectors including solar modules and advanced chemistry cell batteries. If the program works, it could see India establish itself as a “reliable exporter” of solar modules, the IEA said in its 2023 report. “The country already has the world’s fourth largest combined capacity for wind and solar PV electricity generation, and will be the third largest by next year,” Singh said. “In the context of its development journey, India’s clean energy targets are indeed impressive.” If Asia’s third largest economy is able to meet its pledges, it would also offer a new roadmap to growth, one that allows developing countries to get rich and go green at the same time. Major conglomerates are keen to seize the green opportunity. India’s richest men, including Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, are investing billions into clean energy, even though they made their empire on the backs of fossil fuels. “There has probably never been a better time than now for India to grow more sustainably,” said Tim Buckley director of Sydney-based think tank Climate Energy Finance. That’s because of two main reasons: the world is seeing unprecedented levels of investment in clean technologies following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and solar energy is getting significantly cheaper, he explained. But there is still a big funding gap. The IEA has said that energy investments need to nearly triple by the end of this decade for India to be on a trajectory to meet its zero emission targets. The Modi government wants rich nations to do more when it comes to climate financing. The developed world agreed more than a decade ago to transfer at least $100 billion a year to developing countries to help both with their green transitions and efforts to adapt to the climate crisis. That pledge was reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris Agreement, but the target has never been met. In his speech to COP on Friday, Modi warned that “thinking only about one’s self interest will only lead the world into darkness.” Hopefully, that message will be heard by India’s vast bureaucracy as well. “We just need more departmental action and urgency filtering down with respect to the excellent renewables ambition of Modi,” said Buckley. “India needs to make sure there’s an alignment of the implementation so that those really ambitious targets are going to be met”"

What’s left now is the tedious, hard work between countries’ negotiators who are sorting the thorny issue of what to do about fossil fuels.                                             ","Angela Dewan, CNN","The first week of the COP28 climate talks has come to an end not with the euphoria of the first days of breakthrough announcements, but with growing anxiety about whether the world will do anything about the main cause of the climate crisis: fossil fuels. The trade-show-like pavilions — where countries have for days been touting everything from zero-carbon shipping to nuclear fusion energy — are slowly starting to empty. One European nation’s pavilion had just three staff members left late Wednesday morning, all rushing out to catch a flight home. Another representing climate vulnerable states had its lights switched off, no one at all inside. The summit’s glamorous early days are over. What’s left now is the tedious, hard work between countries’ negotiators who are sorting the thorny issue of what to do about fossil fuels — pursuing what could potentially be the most ambitious COP outcome in years. But journalists, delegates and civil society groups are still talking about the summit’s president, whose recent remarks cast a shadow over the negotiations. Comments from Sultan Al Jaber that came to light on Sunday sent shockwaves through Expo City in Dubai: In a late-November panel discussion, he said there is “no science” behind the demand to phase out fossil fuel to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius – the goal of the Paris climate agreement. Al Jaber, who is also an oil executive, fiercely defended his commitment to climate science the next day, and said phasing out fossil fuels is “inevitable” and “essential.” Days later, UN climate chief Simon Steill was asked by a reporter about Al Jaber during a news conference Wednesday, but refused to be drawn on the controversy, saying his focus was now on the summit’s critical negotiations. US climate envoy John Kerry fended off similar inquiries. Kerry has publicly supported Al Jaber’s COP presidency several times, but chose not to wade into it at a press conference Wednesday. He had earlier told POLITICO that Al Jaber’s remarks perhaps “came out the wrong way” and could use a “clarification.” Getting climate action on the same page as the science has never been more urgent; 2023 will officially be the hottest year on record, and even scientists are expressing alarm that the climate impacts they’re seeing are outpacing their predictions. The planet’s average temperature this year is on track to be around 1.4 degrees above pre-industrial levels — just a hair below the Paris Agreement’s threshold. The impacts of the climate crisis weigh heavily on attendees at the talks — but there are now concerns among civil society groups and some delegates that Al Jaber’s remarks may bleed into the negotiations themselves. “The whole COP has been a conflict of interest,” said Isabel Rutkowski from Germany, part of the European Youth Forum. “It’s frustrating because the science is pretty clear, and you have a president for COP who is not following science. It’s crazy.” Whether Al Jaber’s comments will have an impact on final language around fossil fuels is yet to be seen, but countries are deeply divided over the issue. The latest draft of the summit’s key agreement included several options: One called for a phase-out of fossil fuels –— the language widely supported by most climate scientists. Another called for a phase-down of fossil fuels, which is weaker language and leaves the door open for a future with more planet-warming pollution. Another option was to omit language on fossil fuels altogether. The Mexican delegation is supporting a phase-down of fossil fuels, Benjamín Murguía, a technical advisor to Mexican negotiators, told CNN, given the difficulties of getting a “phase-out” through the country’s parliament back home. The delegation doesn’t disagree with all of Al Jaber’s comments, but Murguía said it finds the controversies unhelpful. “It’s frustrating,” said Murguía, who wanted to see more progress and “action” and fewer distractions. “Mexico is a highly vulnerable country and we’re facing that as our own fight,” he said, pointing to Hurricane Otis, which killed dozens of people and tore through coastal cities. “We’re trying to rebuild Acapulco now.” Reaching consensus on fossil fuels was always going to be a tough fight. The UN’s Stiell said Wednesday that there was a “spectrum of positions” on the issue among the nations at the summit. Two sources who were in the room for a late-night drafting session told CNN the US, China and Saudi Arabia all requested a large number of changes to the draft before it was published. Those countries’ negotiators were told to “take a scalpel” and be surgical with the text. A delegate from the Philippines, which represents the G77 nations — a coalition of developing countries — described the US as taking a “broadsword” to the agreement, with nearly 200 edits or comments, the sources said. Some of India’s delegates expressed reservations on phasing out fossil fuels, according to the sources, but the country has previously supported a phase-down. CNN is reaching out to the US, China, Saudi Arabia and India. Al Jaber’s influence over talks may become clearer next week, when ministers and senior officials join other delegates and discuss this language openly in public sessions, said Tom Evans, a policy advisor in climate diplomacy and geopolitics for the E3G climate consultancy. And the controversy could, ironically, bring positive outcomes, he said. “The fact that we have had so much scrutiny on the fossil fuel industry and on the comments on the fossil fuel transition is actually, maybe helpful in putting them under the spotlight and saying, ‘If things do go south, we’ll be pointing at the UAE,’” Evans said. He cautioned that there were several other countries that were blocking progress on including a fossil fuel phase-out, and that failure in that regard wouldn’t solely be the UAE’s doing. “But, we do see that pressure now playing into the discussions, constructively,” he said."

A Colorado program goes a step further and aims to turn working medical professionals into leading experts on climate and health.                                             ","Caleb Hellerman, Global Health Reporting Center","For Dr. Aaron Hultgren, the wake-up call was Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when the young emergency physician returned from an overseas trip and found his hospital without power, its doors closed to the public. Dr. Lakshmi Balasubramanian, an oncologist in Austin, Texas, signed up to study climate medicine after the death of a patient who was trapped in her home during a freak winter storm two years ago. Dr. Paul Charlton, a physician with the Indian Health Service in northwest New Mexico, was motivated by 2023’s summer heat wave, when temperatures cracked 100 degrees Fahrenheit for nearly a week straight in July, setting all-time records. Hultgren, Charlton and Balasubramanian traded these stories in early November as they gathered in College Station, Texas, midway through a first-of-its-kind diploma program that will mint them as certified experts in “climate medicine.” The course is the brainchild of Dr. Jay Lemery, director of the Climate and Health Program at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “This is our first foray into training a climate-savvy health care workforce,” Lemery said. “We need credible, knowledgeable and effective leaders, and we want to send a message to clinicians that these are critically important skills for mitigating climate-driven health effects.” This past weekend, at the UN climate conference in Dubai, 123 countries signed an acknowledgment that climate change is having a major impact on human health, along with announcements of nearly half a billion dollars in funding commitments to bolster health systems and reduce overall harms to human health. Lemery, who was at the meeting, says, “We just saw huge pledges and initiatives to double down on resiliency and decarbonisation, and yet no one has been trained to do this.” Awareness of climate’s harms has been building, especially since 2009, when the journal The Lancet called climate change the “biggest global health threat of the 21st century.” Warming temperatures extend the range of disease-carrying pests like mosquitoes. Heat and drought disrupt crop cycles, leading to food shortages. Between 2030 and 2050, according to a World Health Organization report in October, climate change will cause an extra 250,000 deaths per year just from malnutrition, malaria, diarrheal disease and heat stress. Warnings like this are a growing part of US medical education. Since 2019, the number of US medical schools requiring coursework on the effects of climate change has more than doubled. Universities and public health graduate programs offer majors and concentrations, but the Colorado diploma program goes a step further and aims to turn working medical professionals into leading experts on climate and health. “It’s specifically designed for working clinicians who are seeking a ‘heavyweight’ credential,” said Lemery, an emergency physician by training. “We wanted to build a program that has real gravitas.” Lemery’s program offers five separate certificate programs, each of which satisfies requirements for continuing medical education credits. To earn a diploma, students complete all five, over a period of more than two years. The most recent module was designed to help participants prepare for and simulate a response to a major weather disaster. Following readings and class discussions — over Zoom, since participants live in all corners of the country — course directors Dr. Terry O’Connor and Dr. Bhargavi Chekuri booked two days at a unique training facility. “Disaster City” is sprawled across 52 acres near the Texas A&M campus, where visitors will find upside-down train cars, smashed cars and buses and pile after pile of concrete rubble. Physicians are not the usual clientele; firefighters, EMTs and disasters come for the facility’s world-renowned search-and-rescue training. The November training didn’t include any rubble piles, but the climate medicine students ran through tabletop simulations posing challenges like: What does your hazard vulnerability assessment need to include? How do you convince hospital administrators to pay for expensive, disaster-proofing upgrades that may never be used? If your hospital’s backup generator runs out, do you evacuate all the patients? Lemery says the simulations cut straight to the essence of medical training. “Practice makes perfect. We can’t possibly be good at something unless we flex those muscles, go through the paces and learn how to make it better. When disasters hit, we want our medical teams and hospitals to say, ‘Don’t worry, we got this.’ We don’t want them pacing around wondering where we keep the emergency action plan.” The federal government and states have strict requirements for hospitals to avoid catastrophic power failures, but as the simulation exercise made clear, that may not be enough. Generators flood. Evacuation routes may be blocked. Dr. Karen Glatfelter, a physician from Lawrence, Massachusetts, told the group that supply chain issues are common. “After Hurricane Maria, hospitals across the country ran into IV saline shortages that took months to work through,” she said. Arien Hermann, who oversees a regional hospital coordinating center in southern Illinois, noted that not all electrical outlets are connected to a generator. At one hospital in Hermann’s network, this included the entire kitchen. “So if you lost power, you weren’t going to have a microwave; you weren’t going to have refrigeration; you weren’t going to have electric stoves; you weren’t even going to have lights.” Feeding patients and staff, the group agreed, would be a problem. Hurricane Sandy underscored the vulnerability of many major hospitals. The storm killed at least 147 people and caused $82 billion in damage, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Even Sandy faded into a mere tropical storm, a massive storm surge flooded 51 square miles of New York City, put much of Lower Manhattan underwater, led six hospitals to close and forced the evacuation of 6,500 patients. Hultgren, like many others, was utterly unprepared. “I never in a million years imagined that we would even lose power. It was a complete shock.” Since Sandy, the number of weather disasters causing $1 billion or more in damage has soared; this year alone has seen 23 such events. But a changing climate is only one reason. A major factor is the higher cost of rebuilding, due to inflation, coupled with increased housing density in flood-, fire- and storm-prone areas. As a 2022 report from NOAA points out, “Much of the growth has taken place in vulnerable areas like coasts, the wildland-urban interface, and river floodplains.” But recent years have also seen an apparent rise in storms like Hurricane Harvey, which dropped nearly 60 inches of rain on Houston while barely moving for five days, and Hurricane Idalia, which shocked forecasters in September by growing into a Category 4 storm nearly overnight. Such storms put an additional premium on planning and flexibility. Unpredictable hurricanes aren’t the only threat from climate change, but they are part of what many people describe as climate “weirding,” new weather patterns that upend patterns of sickness and health. Charlton, the Indian Health Service physician, whose home base of Gallup, New Mexico, sits at 6,500 feet of elevation, says he never imagined he would see the kind of extended heat that baked the town this summer. “Until now, we haven’t had to have cooling centers.” Dr. Hilary Ong, a pediatric emergency physician from San Francisco, says doctors are taught to expect a cold and flu season that lasts from October to February. “Now, what I see in the pediatric emergency room is that respiratory season is lasting from September up to August. There was no break.” Ong regularly cares for young patients who are dehydrated from extreme heat or struggling with asthma flare-ups after being exposed to wildfire smoke. She wonders, “Why am I seeing kids with asthma exacerbations all year ‘round?” Being “climate-informed” helps clinicians do their daily jobs better, Chekuri says. She offers the example of a patient who comes in with a nagging cough. “A climate-informed physician might be aware of the fact that our pollen seasons are longer, sometimes more intense” and unpredictable. “If you’re not thinking about that change in the environment, then you can’t ask whether someone has had allergies before.” Most doctors don’t think about climate on a day-to-day basis.“The realization about climate impacts on everyday patients was slow to come to me,” said Dr. Joanne Leovy, a physician from Las Vegas who is pursuing the climate medicine diploma. “People come into the office all the time with climate-related disease that we don’t recognize. And until you learn about the connections, you’re not going to see it.” Many of the first doctors to focus on climate were emergency physicians or disaster relief workers. Those specialties are well represented in the Colorado program, but the group at Disaster City also includes three oncologists, a psychiatrist, an infectious disease specialist, a pediatrician, a family practitioner, two nurses and Hermann, a paramedic, Marine Corps veteran and hospital system administrator. Several students are already deeply involved in efforts to reduce waste and reduce the carbon footprint of the hospitals where they work; they point out that the US health care system is responsible for nearly 9% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Glatfelter pushed her hospital to switch out the standard gases used for anesthesia - replacing desflurane, the use of which in hospitals produces greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to a million cars - with a less-harmful alternative. Dr. Elizabeth Cerceo, a hospitalist who chairs the “green team” at Cooper University Hospital in southern New Jersey, says there’s a laundry list of improvements that most hospitals can make, from re-examining their supply chains to simply replacing standard light bulbs with LEDs. Often, she says, it’s simply inertia that blocks change. Dr. Katie Lichter, an oncology resident at the University of California, San Francisco, co-founded the GreenHealth Lab at UCSF, which generates research reports about the environmental impact of health care practice and “how climate change may reduce patient access to essential care.” Lichter’s big moment of clarity came during the first days of her residency training at UCSF. Just a few months after she moved to San Francisco in 2020, Northern California was struck with a string of severe wildfires that sent a heavy blanket of smoke across the region. Locals still refer to “orange-sky day,” when the thick smoke generated its most surreal views. Lichter had just admitted a patient into the ICU with Covid-19 as well as worsening cancer and lung disease. “He had missed weeks of crucial chemo and radiation because he couldn’t travel because of the wildfires,” she said. Pulling off her mask and gloves and home that night, she had an epiphany: “Climate change was going to impact my patients directly. This would be part of my career in medicine.” Indeed, Lichter’s published research shows that cancer patients treated during times of wildfires have worse outcomes. Although cancer isn’t the first thing that springs to mind when it comes to climate change, Lichter says it shows how climate’s effects ripple through everything the health system touches. “It’s the whole continuum of care,” she said. “Climate change increases exposure to carcinogens through air pollution and increased exposure to viral causes of cancer. And with screening, climate disasters impact access, like a patient’s ability to go get a mammography.” The ability to access treatment, too. Balasubramanian, the Austin-based oncologist, can’t say for sure that a winter storm killed her patient, but the woman had been fine a few days earlier. “She was thriving and doing very well,” the doctor recalls. “She was an avid volunteer and an advocate for pets and other women with breast cancer.” The Colorado team encourages participants in the diploma program to be advocates on climate-related issues. Says Ong, “That’s really my motivation [for taking this course], to learn about this kind of medicine, to be a better physician and in order to lead and advocate and educate my peers and colleagues.” Lemery points out that even after the height of the Covid pandemic, doctors and nurses typically rank high as trusted sources of information. “It’s important to bring the best science forward with candid-evidence based risk assessments. Our job is to train practitioners to be confident and proficient in doing just that.” Mike Bethel, a nurse in Fresno, California, says he feels a duty “to speak out, as that trusted source, about things we know are true. We know that climate change is happening, and we know that it’s impacting our health negatively. When we don’t speak out about that as a profession, I think we do a disservice.” Bethel says air pollution blocks views of the coastal mountain range that were visible almost every day when he was a Boy Scout roaming the mountains not far from where he lives today. He goes on to list other ominous signs. In Fresno, he says, “summers are longer. Summers are hotter. Our wildfire seasons have extended; they’re starting earlier and ending later. I mean, we’re already beyond a point of no return. There’s some damage that is irreparable, and if we continue, we’re going to damage the planet to the point where maybe it’s just not habitable.” This dark view is shared by many here, but it’s tempered by a strong streak of idealism. Hultgren, who was an elementary school teacher before going to medical school, says he’s excited about forging a new path. “As an emergency medicine physician, you always want to be at the front line, and I feel like I am at the front line, really trying to do something. We’re trying to change and hopefully impact our future for the better.” Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Disaster City is located near the Texas A&M University campus in College Station, Texas."

","Ella Nilsen and Ariel Edwards-Levy, CNN","Nearly two-thirds of US adults say they are worried about the threat of climate change in their communities, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. More than half are worried about the impact of extreme weather, as the climate crisis touches every region in the form of extreme heat, devastating storms and drought. Even more want the federal government to do something about it. A broad majority of US adults – 73% – say the federal government should develop its climate policies with the goal of cutting the country’s planet-warming pollution in half by the end of the decade. That has been the goal of President Joe Biden, who has made tackling the climate crisis a greater priority than any other president, including through billions of dollars in tax subsidies to create more renewable energy infrastructure and help consumers buy discounted electric vehicles, solar panels and energy-efficient appliances. The Biden administration is also crafting and implementing several federal regulations designed to cut pollution from the oil and gas industry, power plants, and gas-powered vehicles. The polling comes as nations debate the future of fossil fuels at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Vice President Kamala Harris announced at the summit last week that the US would commit another $3 billion to the global climate action fund, and the Biden administration announced new rules to slash emissions of methane – a powerful planet-warming gas – by 80% from the US oil and gas industry. Cutting US climate pollution is a bipartisan aspiration, the CNN poll finds. Nearly all Democrats say the US should slash its greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030, and 76% of independents and half of Republicans agree. American voters could be presented with a stark choice on how their country addresses climate change in the 2024 election; a potential rematch between Biden – who signed the country’s biggest climate investment into law last year – and former President Donald Trump, a climate change denier who has vowed to repeal several of Biden’s signature clean-energy policies. When it comes to climate change, Americans say by a 13-point margin that their views align with Democrats more than Republicans. Much like abortion, climate change is one of the strongest issues for Democrats, CNN’s poll finds. Americans give Biden a 43% approval rating for his handling of environmental policy, which is several points above his overall approval rating and well above his numbers for handling the economy. But few Americans, only 2%, see climate change as the most important issue facing the country, giving higher priority to the economy and cost of living. But climate change and clean energy are increasingly intertwined with the economy. Climate change-fueled disasters don’t just impact commerce, they also strike at the heart of the American dream: homeownership. In some states prone to wildfires and extreme weather, the cost of home and property insurance is skyrocketing. In some cases, insurance companies are dropping coverage all together because the risk is too high. That, in turn, has damaging implications for the housing market and cost of homes, experts have told CNN. Most US adults say humanity bears a great deal of responsibility to try to reduce climate change but believe the US and Chinese governments and the energy industry are all doing too little to fix the problem. Americans are also finding less fault with themselves: A somewhat lower 40% of Americans say that people like them hold a great deal of responsibility to reduce climate change. Meanwhile, 58% say that they, personally, are doing the right amount to reduce their impact on the climate crisis, with 37% saying that they are doing too little. As past polls have found, there is a profound partisan divide over how Americans feel about climate change, and what to do about it, that outweighs other factors such as age and gender. The poll finds Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that humanity bears a great deal of responsibility to reduce climate change (77% vs. 42%). And Democrats are 36 percentage points likelier than Republicans to say they’re very worried about the risk of climate change in the communities where they live. But the fact that human activity is fueling the planet’s warming isn’t lost on Republicans; the poll finds about three-quarters of them think humanity has at least some responsibility to fight climate change. The poll finds that more than 4 in 10 Americans say they’ve experienced extreme weather over the past year, with most in that group calling climate change a contributing factor. In the past few years, Americans have faced climate-fueled extreme heat, drought and flash flooding that has devastated communities. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from November 1-30 among a random national sample of 1,795 adults initially reached by mail. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups."

","Angela Dewan, CNN","The world is still off track to limit global warming to the crucial 1.5-degree threshold, despite pollution-slashing pledges made by dozens of countries at UN-backed climate talks in Dubai, an analysis by the International Energy Agency published Sunday shows. The assessment is the first comprehensive report card on what the COP28 climate talks in Dubai have so far achieved. The results show that the commitments would slash greenhouse gas emissions by 4 gigatons — less than one-third of what is now required to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above temperatures before industrialization. Science shows that life on Earth will struggle to adapt beyond that point. An IEA statement said the pledges “would not be nearly enough” to keep global heating to 1.5 degrees. Executive Director Fatih Birol said the pledges were “positive” and in line with some of the recommendations the IEA had made ahead of the talks. But he said not enough countries had joined them and that commitments to ensuring a decline in fossil fuel use was needed to bridge the gap. “The IEA’s very latest assessment of these pledges shows that if they are fully implemented by their signatories to date, they would bridge only 30% of the gap to reaching international climate goals,” Birol told CNN. “There is a need for more countries and companies to join the pledges — and for agreement on an orderly and just decline of global fossil fuel use if we want to keep the 1.5 °C goal in reach.” Negotiators at COP28 are discussing an agreement in which they could call for the phase-out of fossil fuels — the main driver of climate change — for the first time at the annual climate talks. Language on fossil fuels has been highly contentious, and there are deep divisions over the issue. More than 100 countries support a phase-out in some form, but some oil-producing nations don’t want any reference to reducing oil and gas at all. The IEA analysis was based on pledges around renewable energy, energy efficiency and the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. More than 120 countries, including the United States, have now agreed to support tripling the world’s renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency measures. Fifty major oil and gas companies, including Exxon and Saudi Aramco, also signed a pledge at the talks to cut methane emissions from their oil and gas operations by the end of the decade. That means a reduction in methane intensity of around 80 to 90% from their products. They also agreed to end routine flaring by 2030. Flaring is the deliberate burning of natural gas during oil extraction. Companies sometimes flare natural gas to depressurize systems during oil drilling, though at other times, flaring occurs when an operator doesn’t need or want to collect all the gas available, often because it’s cheaper to burn it than collect it. Fossil fuel consumption is the main driver of the climate crisis. Countries agreed to a phase-down in coal production in 2021 at the COP26 talks in Glasgow, Scotland, but negotiations on language around all fossil fuels, including oil and gas, are proving more contentious. The talks are happening at the tail-end of a year hit hard by the worsening climate crisis. Scientists have confirmed that 2023 is officially the hottest on record. Extreme weather events made more likely or intense by the climate crisis — including fires, floods, heatwaves and hurricanes — have claimed lives in many parts of the world. The COP28 presidency responded to the IEA’s assessment, saying the progress it outlined showed “a major breakthrough,” adding “no previous COP has achieved so much so soon.” COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber told reporters earlier that progress in the negotiations on a final agreement, however, were not moving fast enough. “Am I satisfied with the speed and the pace? The answer is ‘No,’” he said on Sunday before convening a roundtable of ministers to try and break the impasse over several issues, including the future of fossil fuels. “Time is ticking. The clock is ticking, and I’m sure you can all hear it, just like how I am able to hear it,” he said, “and we need to move much, much, much faster.” Al Jaber has been the subject of controversy for months, well before the talks began on November 30. The United Arab Emirates has been accused of a conflict of interest in appointing Al Jaber to chair the talks as he also runs the country’s state-owned oil and gas company, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company."

","Avery Lotz and Jack Forrest, CNN","Climate advocate and former Vice President Al Gore on Sunday called into question the decision to hold the COP28 climate talks in the United Arab Emirates, a leading producer of the world’s oil. Gore also criticized the appointment of Sultan Al Jaber, CEO of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), as the conference’s president, given that countries gathered in Dubai for the annual climate conference are discussing ways to reduce or eliminate the use of fossil fuels. “It’s not so much that it’s in a country that produces oil; it’s the appointment of the CEO of one the biggest and least responsible oil companies on the planet to be the head of the conference,” Gore said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” characterizing Al Jaber’s role as a “direct conflict of interest” and arguing the fossil fuel industry has “gone too far.” CNN has reached out to ADNOC for comment. But Gore remained optimistic, saying that the UN-backed summit’s controversial location and leader could be a “blessing in disguise” that “has awakened a lot of people to how absurd this situation is.” “I think there’s a chance that we could see a surprisingly good outcome here if the majority of the countries there hold on to their convictions and demand a phaseout of fossil fuels,” he said. Al Jaber, in a late November panel discussion, said there is “no science” behind the demand to phase out fossil fuel to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius – the goal of the Paris climate agreement. After those comments came to light last week, Al Jaber fiercely defended his commitment to climate science and said phasing out fossil fuels is “inevitable” and “essential.” US climate envoy John Kerry has publicly supported Al Jaber’s COP presidency several times but chose not to wade into it at a news conference last week. The first week of COP28 came to close on Thursday and countries will now begin negotiating an agreement around the phaseout of fossil fuels — which are the main driver of climate change — for the first time at the annual climate talks. More than 100 countries support a phaseout in some form, but some oil-producing nations don’t want any reference to reducing oil and gas. Gore on Sunday also attributed a global mental health crisis in part to unaddressed threats around climate change. “The people of our world deserve to have some confidence that this process has integrity,” he said, “and we’ve been seeing the fossil fuel polluters try to manipulate this process for a long time, and the world is running out of patience.” Despite pollution-slashing pledges made at the conference, the world is still off track to limit global warming to the crucial 1.5-degree threshold, an analysis by the International Energy Agency published Sunday shows. A statement from the agency said the pledges “would not be nearly enough” to accomplish what is now required to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above temperatures before industrialization The former vice president on Sunday also weighed in on what another Donald Trump presidency would look like, pointing to Trump’s comment to Fox’s Sean Hannity during a town hall last week that he wouldn’t be a dictator “except for Day 1.” Gore told CNN’s Jake Tapper, “You kind of wonder what it’ll take for people to believe him when he tells us who he is.” “And the solution to political despair is political action. And for those in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party and independents who love American democracy and who want to preserve our capacity to govern ourselves and solve our problems, now’s the time to get active,” Gore added. Trump’s remark to Hannity last week was in response to comments made by former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican who lost her seat to a Trump-backed primary challenger last year after she participated in the House select committee that probed the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. She said in a recent CBS interview that the nation would be “sleepwalking into a dictatorship” if Trump were to win the 2024 presidential election. Trump, in a speech hosted by the New York Young Republican Club on Saturday, called worries about him becoming a threat to Democracy “a hoax.

","Angela Dewan and Laura Paddison, CNN","Climate advocates are warning the COP28 climate summit could be on the cusp of failure after a new draft of the core agreement removed a call to phase out fossil fuels, the main driver of the climate crisis. The draft, posted Monday more than six hours later than expected, instead used watered-down language on fossil fuels in an apparent concession to oil-producing nations that opposed the measure. It calls on countries to take actions to reduce planet-warming pollution, which “could” include reducing the consumption and production of oil, coal and gas. Many climate experts and observers have blasted the draft for its vague language – including the use of the nonspecific “could” – and a lack of concrete timelines. More than 100 countries came to the Dubai talks supporting language to phase out fossil fuels, and many are likely to voice their opposition in coming sessions. Others, such as Saudi Arabia, which have pushed against the inclusion of any reference to fossil fuels, may attempt to water the text down further still. If the current draft does not get widespread support, negotiators may need to return to debate. Earlier drafts had included several options that called on countries to phase out climate-polluting oil, gas and coal, which observers said was an encouraging sign that this year’s summit agreement would be stronger than previous years. Climate advocate and former US Vice President Al Gore said in a post on X the summit “is now on the verge of complete failure.” “The world desperately needs to phase out fossil fuels as quickly as possible, but this obsequious draft reads as if OPEC dictated it word for word,” Gore said. “It is even worse than many had feared.” The secretary-general of the oil-producing group OPEC, Haitham Al Ghais, called on members and allies last week to “proactively reject” any language that targeted fossil fuels rather than emissions. The letter, written before the latest draft was posted, noted the previous option for a “fossil fuels phase out” and said it would be “unacceptable that politically motivated campaigns put our people’s prosperity and future at risk.” The new draft calls for countries to take action to reduce planet-warming emissions, with a menu of choices that could include “reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner so as to achieve net zero by, before, or around 2050 in keeping with the science.” It also includes an option for “tripling renewable energy capacity globally.” “We have made progress. But we still have a lot to do,” COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber said Monday in a summit session. “You know what remains to be agreed. And you know that I want you to deliver the highest ambition on all items, including on fossil fuel language.” Al Jaber, who is also the head of the UAE’s state-owned oil company, has had a controversial summit. Shockwaves ripped through the talks shortly after they began last weekend when comments from Al Jaber made in November came to light. In a panel discussion, he said there is “no science” behind the demand that phasing out fossil fuels is necessary to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius — the goal of the Paris climate agreement. In response, Al Jaber fiercely defended his commitment to climate science the next day, and said phasing out fossil fuels is “inevitable” and “essential.” Monday’s draft came after marathon negotiations and was published more than six hours later than expected. The conference is due to end on Tuesday, but the new draft — which is far from what many nations in Dubai had called for — could prolong one of the most contentious and high-stakes conferences in its nearly three decade history. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organization, has already indicated its members will not approve the agreement in its current form and has criticized the negotiations as lacking transparency and inclusivity. “We will not sign our death certificate,” Cedric Schuster, a Samoan politician and chair of AOSIS, said in a statement. “We cannot sign on to text that does not have strong commitments on phasing out fossil fuels.” A US State Department spokesperson said in a statement the draft “seeks to balance a variety of interests,” but still “needs to be substantially strengthened.” Lead negotiators for the European Union described the draft as “insufficient.” “I cannot hide the fact from you that the text, as it now stands, is disappointing,” EU Climate Action Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told reporters. “There are a couple of good things in there, but overall, it is clearly insufficient and not adequate to addressing the problem we are here to address.” Hoekstra added that the EU was sticking to its stance, calling for the for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas, allowing only for fossil fuel use in sectors where renewables are difficult to employ. Heavy industries like steelmaking, for example, can’t use wind and solar power. Alok Sharma, a British MP and the president of COP26 in Glasgow two years ago, said it’s “difficult to see how this text will help to achieve the deep and rapid cut in emissions we need by 2030.” “With so many countries backing clear language on fossil-fuel-phase-out, who does this text actually serve?” Sharma said on X, formerly Twitter. Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, said the latest draft was “a significant regression” from previous versions. “Astonishingly, it has dropped explicit language on phasing out fossil fuels, opting instead for a vague commitment to ‘reduce both consumption and production’ by 2050,” he told CNN. “This is a clear indication of the fossil fuel industry’s lobbying power, influencing global policies to favor prolonged fossil fuel use.” Rachel Cleetus, the policy director and a lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the draft agreement was “extremely disappointing, concerning, and nowhere close to the level of ambition people around the world deserve.” “This draft comes with a huge qualifier of ‘could’ at the top that makes all the listed actions optional for nations. It has a laundry list of actions filled with glaring loopholes, including a lack of meaningful timelines” she said in a statement. Some experts were more optimistic. “We are cooking a fossil free meal here in Dubai,” said Mohamed Adow, director of climate think tank Power Shift Africa, in a statement. “People will argue if it’s the correct recipe, but the main thing is that all the right ingredients are there.” This story has been updated with additional information. CNN’s Ella Nilsen and Rachel Ramirez contributed to this report."

","Angela Dewan and Ella Nilsen, CNN","A new draft of the centerpiece agreement at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai makes an unprecedented mention of transitioning away from fossil fuels, in what some experts are welcoming as the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era. But it does not call for the world to “phase out” coal, oil and gas — as more than 100 countries had hoped — and includes “loopholes” that would allow for their continued use, even beyond 2050. The draft, which could continue to be debated, calls on countries to “contribute” collectively to global efforts to reduce climate pollution in a way that they see fit. It offers eight options, one of which is “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems … accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050.” Countries could choose other options instead, including contributing to a global goal of tripling renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency. Climate advocates and policy experts welcomed the call to transition away from fossil fuels — the main driver of the climate crisis — saying it sends a signal to countries to make plans to wean off coal, oil and gas and recognizes this decade as critical for action. The draft “sends a signal that the fossil industry’s days are numbered,” Teresa Anderson, global climate lead at ActionAid, said in a statement. But Anderson pointed out several weaknesses in the draft, including references to accelerating growth in “removal technologies,” also known as carbon capture, which would allow for the continued use of fossil fuels if their carbon pollution was removed before entering the atmosphere. Many scientists have expressed concern that carbon capture is expensive, unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use. “The text has many loopholes and offers several gifts to the greenwashers, with mentions of carbon capture and storage, so-called transition fuels, nuclear power and carbon markets,” she said. “Overall, it maps a rocky road towards a fossil free future.” The draft was published Wednesday morning local time, more than 12 hours after the summit’s deadline, as talks ran hours into overtime as countries negotiated language around fossil fuels and other sticking points. There will be widespread appetite to wrap up talks by the end of the day, which will require a vote on the draft in a plenary session that will be publicly available online. What to do about the future of fossil fuels has been the most contentious issue at these talks. Some more ambitious nations and climate advocate had expressed anger and frustration an earlier draft dropped the call for a phase-out. If the text is agreed by countries, it would represent a “significant moment,” Stephen Cornelius, WWF deputy global climate and energy lead, said in a statement. “[But] this cannot be the benchmark by which we judge the outcome of this COP,” he said. “Countries must use these final hours to push for an even more ambitious text that is fully aligned with preventing the most devastating consequences of the climate crisis.” The annual climate talks are often divisive and run into extra hours, but COP28 has been particularly fraught, with criticism that oil interests have derailed the process. The fossil fuel industry was given record access to the conference, a recent analysis showed. COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, who is presiding over the talks, also leads the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company as it undergoes a major expansion in oil and gas production. He has consistently rejected criticisms of a conflict of interest and pledged to hold a transparent process. The secretary-general of the oil-producing group OPEC, Haitham Al Ghais, called on members and allies last week to “proactively reject” any language that targeted reducing fossil fuel use, telling members to support language that focuses on “emissions” instead. Saudi Arabia and Iraq were among the countries that did not want reference to a phase-out of fossil fuels in the text, Catherine Abreu, the founder and executive director of the nonprofit group Destination Zero, told reporters in Dubai. Kuwait’s state news agency KUNA said the country’s delegation to COP28 was “reaffirming” its rejection of a phase-out as well. The COP28 presidency has fended off criticism that the text had been too watered down. On Tuesday, it said it supported a “historic” deal that included some language on fossil fuels and aimed for “the highest ambition.” “We are facing the most demanding COP agenda of all time,” said COP28 Director-General Ambassador Majid Al Suwaidi in a news conference. This is a developing story and it has been updated."

","Allison Chinchar, CNN","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Glaciers in the Himalayas are melting rapidly, but a new report showed an astonishing phenomenon in the world’s tallest mountain range could be helping to slow the effects of the global climate crisis. When warming temperatures hit certain high-altitude ice masses, it sets off a surprising reaction that blows robust cold winds down the slopes, according to the study published December 4 in the journal Nature Geoscience. The warming climate creates a greater temperature gap between the surrounding air above Himalayan glaciers and the cooler air directly in contact with the ice masses’ surface, explained Francesca Pellicciotti, professor of glaciology at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of the study. “This leads to an increase in turbulent heat exchange at the glacier’s surface and stronger cooling of the surface air mass,” she said in a news release. As the cool, dry surface air gets cooler and denser, it sinks. The air mass flows down the slopes into the valleys, causing a cooling effect in the glaciers’ lower areas and neighboring ecosystems. With ice and snow from the mountain range feeding into 12 rivers that provide fresh water to nearly 2 billion people in 16 countries, it’s important to find out whether the Himalayan glaciers can keep up this self-preserving cooling effect as the region faces a likely rise in temperatures over the next few decades. A June report previously covered by CNN showed that glaciers in the Himalayas melted 65% faster in the 2010s compared with the previous decade, which suggests rising temperatures are already having an impact in the area. “The main impact of rising temperature on glaciers is an increase of ice losses, due to melt increase,” said Fanny Brun, a research scientist at the Institut des Géosciences de l’Environnement in Grenoble, France. She was not involved in the study. “The primary mechanisms are the lengthening and intensification of the melt season. They cause glaciers to thin and retreat, leading to deglaciated landscapes that tend to further increase the air temperature due (to) larger energy absorption by the surface,” Brun said. That energy absorption at the surface is determined by something called the albedo effect. Light or “white” surfaces such as clean snow and ice will reflect more sunlight (high albedo) compared with “dark” surfaces such as the land that is exposed as glaciers retreat, soil and oceans (low albedo). In general, Brun said this phenomenon is interpreted as a positive feedback loop, or a process that enhances a change, but it is overall poorly studied and difficult to quantify. At the base of Mount Everest, however, measurements of overall temperature averages appeared curiously stable instead of increasing. A close analysis of the data revealed what was really happening. “While the minimum temperatures have been steadily on the rise, the surface temperature maxima in summer were consistently dropping,” said Franco Salerno, coauthor of the report and researcher for the National Research Council of Italy, or CNR. However, even the presence of these cooling winds is not enough to fully counteract increasing temperatures and glacier melt due to climate change. Thomas Shaw, who is part of the ISTA research group with Pellicciotti, said the reason these glaciers are nevertheless melting rapidly is complex. “The cooling is local, but perhaps still not sufficient to overcome the larger impact of climatic warming and fully preserve the glaciers,” Shaw said. Pellicciotti explained that the general scarcity of data in high-elevation areas across the globe is what led to the study team’s focus of using the unique ground observation records at one station in the Himalayas. “The process we highlighted in the paper is potentially of global relevance and may occur on any glacier worldwide where conditions are met,” she said. The new study provides a compelling motivation to collect more high-elevation, long-term data that are strongly needed to prove the new findings and their broader impacts, Pellicciotti said. Located at a glacierized elevation of 5,050 meters (16,568 feet), the Pyramid International Laboratory/Observatory climate station sits along the southern slopes of Mount Everest. The observatory has recorded detailed meteorological data for almost 30 years. It’s those granular meteorological observations that Pellicciotti, Salerno and a team of researchers used to conclude that warming temperatures are triggering what are called katabatic winds. The cold winds, created by air flowing downhill, usually occur in mountainous regions, including the Himalayas. “Katabatic winds are a common feature of Himalayan glaciers and their valleys, and have likely always occurred,” Pellicciotti said. “What we observe however is a significant increase in intensity and duration of katabatic winds, and this is due to the fact that the surrounding air temperatures have increased in a warming world.” Another thing the team observed was higher ground-level ozone concentrations in connection with lower temperatures. This evidence demonstrates that katabatic winds work as a pump that’s able to transport cold air from the higher elevation and the atmospheric layers down to the valley, Pellicciotti explained. “According to the current state of knowledge, Himalayan glaciers are doing slightly better than average glaciers in terms of mass losses,” Brun said. Brun explained that in Central Himalaya, on average, the glaciers have thinned about 9 meters (29.5 feet) over the past two decades. “This is much lower than glaciers in Europe, which have thinned of about 20 meters (65.6 feet) over the same time span, but this is larger than other regions in Asia (for example in the Karakoram region), or in the Arctic region,” Brun said. Understanding how long these glaciers are capable of locally counteracting global warming’s impacts could be crucial in order to effectively address our changing world. “We believe that the katabatic winds are the response of healthy glaciers to rising global temperatures and that this phenomenon could help preserve the permafrost and surrounding vegetation,” said study coauthor Nicolas Guyennon, a researcher at the National Research Council of Italy. Further analysis is needed, however. The study team next aims to identify the glacial characteristics that favor the cooling effect. Pellicciotti said more long-term ground stations for testing this hypothesis elsewhere are virtually absent. “Even if the glaciers can’t preserve themselves forever, they might still preserve the environment around them for some time,” she said. “Thus, we call for more multidisciplinary research approaches to converge efforts toward explaining the effects of global warming.” A separate report in 2019 found that even in the most optimistic case, in which average global warming was limited to only 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial temperatures, the Himalaya region would lose at least one-third of its glaciers."

The world’s latest climate deal could be that milestone. But recent events show the oil and gas industry still has a very different vision of the future. Following marathon talks, the COP28 climate summit in Dubai struck a deal Wednesday that makes the unprecedented call for “transitioning away from fossil fuels.” Some countries, including the United States, welcomed the firmest-ever commitment to moving away from energy sources responsible for most planet-heating emissions, but critics were quick to point out that the agreement falls far short of requiring the world to “phase-out” oil, coal and gas, a position more than 100 nations had supported. “The resolution is marred by loopholes that offer the fossil fuel industry numerous escape routes,” said Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International. However vague or watered down the language, the deal looks out of touch with reality. US oil production is at a record; India plans to double coal output by 2030; the UK is issuing new drilling licences in the North Sea; and American oil majors are splurging billions on deals that signal they see robust demand for decades to come. “Anything less than a systematic transformation of the fossil fuel industry would be at odds with COP28’s deal,” said Daniel Klier, the CEO of ESG Book, a provider of sustainability data on companies. “The reality is no single climate summit can single-handedly drive the transition away from fossil fuels, let alone a phase out.” The latest evidence of the industry doubling down on fossil fuels came Monday, when Occidental Petroleum said it would pay $12 billion in cash and stock to buy US shale oil producer CrownRock. It followed ExxonMobil’s (XOM) October announcement of a $60 billion deal to acquire shale driller Pioneer Natural Resources, and Chevron’s (CVX) agreement less than two weeks later to buy shale producer Hess for $53 billion. Hess (HES) also has large oil assets in Guyana, which Chevron said would help grow its production over the next decade. Another $50-billion oil and gas deal could take shape soon, this time in Australia. Woodside Energy and Santos are talking about a merger that would create one of the world’s biggest exporters of liquified natural gas (LNG) in a clear bet on continued strong demand from Asia for the fuel. “Markets aren’t functioning properly and are rewarding the wrong companies … If anything, our future depends on markets rewarding those oil companies that are decarbonising at pace,” said ESG Book’s Klier. But cash-rich oil giants are taking advantage of recent windfall profits to snap up lower-cost assets and boost shareholder returns, while directing much less investment to renewable energy. The industry invested just $20 billion in clean energy projects last year — only around 2.5% of its total capital spending, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The Paris-based agency says that share would need to shoot up to 50% by 2030 to help keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels — a limit scientists say is crucial to avoid a significant worsening in the effects of climate change, including extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages. The recent flurry of deals offers little hope that oil and gas firms are planning radical changes to how they spend their cash, even though that is what is urgently needed. “With the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement last month ahead of the climate summit. “The oil and gas industry is facing a moment of truth at COP28 in Dubai.” On Wednesday, Birol struck a more sanguine note. “I congratulate the #COP28 Presidency & countries for this major outcome that clearly states the goal of transitioning away from fossil fuels in line with 1.5C,” he posted to X. The IEA did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, beyond Birol’s remark, on how the deal stacks up with what is unfolding on the ground, which is clearly at odds with its previous calls for a stop to all new investment in oil and gas projects. The agency said Sunday that the world is still off-track to limit global warming to the crucial 1.5-degree threshold, despite pollution-slashing pledges made by dozens of countries at COP28. It thinks global demand for oil, gas and coal is likely to peak by 2030. Even Europe’s oil giants, including Shell (SHEL) and BP (BP), which have a better track record on renewable energy investment than their US rivals, are still channeling billions towards fossil fuels. Earlier this year, BP backed away from climate targets it set three years ago, curbing ambitious cuts to carbon emissions and oil and gas production. Oil and gas companies operating in Norway, western Europe’s largest producer, are planning to invest 240 billion Norwegian crowns ($21.85 billion) in 2024 — 9% up on this year and nearly a quarter more than previously expected, Reuters reported — citing a survey from industry group Offshore Norway. Elsewhere, the United Kingdom committed earlier this year to granting “hundreds” of new licenses to enable companies to drill for oil and gas in the North Sea. Much bigger oil and gas producing nations also look to be heading in the wrong direction. In a joint statement Wednesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GEPC) — groups that include the United Arab Emirates, host of COP28 — welcomed the “consensual and positive” outcome reached in Dubai but stressed that “continued investment in oil and natural gas is essential.” A recent United Nations Environment Programme report found that the world’s fossil fuel production in 2030 is set to be more than twice the amount needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. One of the major contributors to that disastrous overshoot will be India, which is burning ever greater amounts of coal and oil as it tries to meet the needs of its 1.4 billion people. It plans to double domestic coal production by 2030, even as it also sets ambitious targets for renewable energy. In perhaps the clearest sign yet that the world’s latest climate deal will do little to reshape the future for fossil fuel producers, Saudi Arabia — the world’s biggest oil exporter and OPEC kingpin — welcomed it. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told state-owned news outlet Al Arabiya that the COP28 deal would not affect the Kingdom’s hydrocarbon exports. “The text, it provides alternatives,” he said."

","Angela Dewan, Laura Paddison, Ella Nilsen and Rachel Ramirez, CNN","The world agreed to a new climate deal in Dubai on Wednesday at the COP28 summit after two weeks of painstaking talks, making an unprecedented call to transition away from fossil fuels, but using vague language that could allow some countries to take minimal action. The gavel went down on the agreement, known as the Global Stocktake, in the morning after the talks were pushed into overtime by marathon negotiations between countries bitterly divided over the future role for oil, gas and coal. COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber called the agreement “historic” in his speech before national delegates at the final session approving the agreement. “We have language on fossil fuels in our final agreement for the first time ever,” he said, adding that the deal represented “a paradigm shift that has the potential to redefine our economies.” Some countries claimed the deal signaled the end of the fossil fuel era, but more ambitious nations and climate advocates said it was still far from sufficient to reflect the growing urgency of the climate crisis. “At long last the loud calls to end fossil fuels have landed on paper in black and white at this COP,” said Jean Su, the energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, “but cavernous loopholes threaten to undermine this breakthrough moment.” The agreement falls short of requiring the world to “phase-out” oil, coal and gas — which more than 100 countries and many climate groups had been calling for, language which was included in an earlier version of the draft. Instead, the agreement “calls on” countries to “contribute” to global efforts to reduce carbon pollution in ways they see fit, offering several options, one of which is “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems … accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050.” Key takeaways: What does the COP28 deal say? COP28 has taken place at the end of a year defined by unprecedented global heat, which has driven deadly extreme weather, including record wildfires, deadly heat waves and catastrophic floods. This year is officially the hottest on record, due to a combination of human-caused global warming and El Niño, and next year is set to be hotter still. The conference in Dubai has been marred by controversy and criticism that oil interests were influencing the talks. The conference also saw deep divisions, with Saudi Arabia leading a group of oil-producing nations rejecting language on phasing out fossil fuels. On the other side, more ambitious parties, including the European Union and a group of island states, expressed anger over a previous draft with watered-down language on fossil fuels. US climate envoy John Kerry said divisions nearly derailed the conference, as oil- and gas-producing nations pushed back on fossil fuel language. “I think there were times in the last 48 hours where some of us thought this could fail,” Kerry told reporters Wednesday. But ultimately they “stepped up and said, ‘we want this to succeed.’” Kerry called the deal a success and a vindication of multilateralism. “All of us can find a paragraph or sentences, or sections, where we would have said it differently,” he said in an earlier speech after the deal was agreed. But, he added, “to have as strong a document as has been put together, I find is cause for optimism, cause for gratitude and cause for some significant congratulations to everybody here.” He said that the agreement was “much stronger and clearer as a call on 1.5 than we have ever heard,” referring to the internally-agreed ambition to restrict global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a threshold beyond which scientists say humans and ecosystems will struggle to adapt. “The message coming out of this COP is we are moving away from fossil fuels,” Kerry said. “We’re not turning back.” Several parties expressed disappointment and concerns over how quickly Al Jaber struck his gavel and adopted the draft deal. Typically countries voice their support or objections and agreement follows a debate. “It seems that you gavelled the decisions and the small island developing states were not in the room,” Anne Rasmussen, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), said to Al Jaber once they entered the room. AOSIS, an intergovernmental organization of countries disproportionately at risk from the climate crisis, is one of the most powerful voices at the annual climate talks. AOSIS was “exceptionally concerned” about the agreement, Rasmussen added. While the text contains “many good elements,” she said, “the course correction that is needed has not yet been secured” and “we see a litany of loopholes.” “It is not enough for us to reference the science and then make agreements that ignore what the science is telling us we need to do,” she said in her speech which was met with a standing ovation from delegates. Many climate experts, while cautiously welcoming the reference to fossil fuels in the agreement, point to serious weaknesses, including leaving the door open for fossil fuel expansion to continue. Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International, said “after decades of evasion, COP28 finally cast a glaring spotlight on the real culprits of the climate crisis: fossil fuels. A long-overdue direction to move away from coal, oil, and gas has been set.” But, he added, “the resolution is marred by loopholes that offer the fossil fuel industry numerous escape routes, relying on unproven, unsafe technologies.” His reference is to the controversial technology known as carbon capture and storage — a set of techniques being developed to pull carbon pollution from polluting facilities such as power plants and from the air, and store it underground. The agreement calls for an acceleration of the technology. Many scientists have expressed concern that carbon capture is unproven at scale, a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use and too expensive. Some countries and experts were alarmed by the agreement’s recognition of a role for “transitional fuels” in the energy transition — largely interpreted to mean natural gas, a planet-heating fossil fuel. “We want to raise the alarm that transition fuel will become permanent especially in developing countries,” said an Antigua and Barbuda delegate. There was also criticism over a failure to ensure enough funding will flow to the poorest, most climate-vulnerable countries to help them adapt to the escalating impacts of the climate crisis and move their economies toward renewable energy. COP28 started with an early success on finance. On the first day, countries formally adopted a loss and damage fund decades in the making, and have since made pledges of more than $700 million to help nations on the front lines of climate change. But the summit agreement — while acknowledging developing countries need up to $387 billion a year to adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis and around $4.3 trillion is required each year up to 2030 to scale up renewable energy — includes no requirements for developed countries to give more. Developing countries “still dependent on fossil fuels for energy, income, and jobs, are left without robust guarantees for adequate financial support,” Singh said. Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, said in a statement the “transition” in this agreement “is not funded or fair.” “We’re still missing enough finance to help developing countries decarbonise and there needs to be greater expectation on rich fossil fuel producers to phase out first,” Adow said."

Others say it’s undermined by a “litany of loopholes.” Here’s why the final agreement is dividing opinion. The agreement marks the first time the annual UN meeting has asked countries to move away from fossil fuels — the main driver of the climate crisis. The text of the agreement “calls on” countries to “contribute” to global efforts to reduce carbon pollution. It lists a menu of actions they can take, including “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems … accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050.” What the agreement doesn’t do is require a “phase-out” of fossil fuels. That ambitious language was supported by more than 100 countries, including the United States and European Union, but was fiercely opposed by fossil fuel states such as Saudi Arabia. The agreement also calls for a tripling of renewable energy capacity and a doubling of energy efficiency, both by 2030. Countries are also being asked to have detailed adaptation plans in place by 2025, to show how they intend to deal with the current and future impacts of the escalating climate crisis. The agreement also acknowledges the need for trillions of dollars of funding to flow from rich countries to poorer, climate vulnerable ones, to help them adapt climate change and transition to renewable energy. But there are no requirements in the deal for wealthy countries to give more. The agreement contains a “litany of loopholes” which could “take us backward rather than forward,” Anne Rasmussen, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a speech Wednesday. Those loopholes refer to the option for countries to accelerate zero- and low-carbon technologies, including carbon capture and storage – a set of techniques that are still being developed with the aim of removing carbon pollution from the atmosphere. Many scientists and other experts have said that carbon capture is unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use, potentially giving license to polluters to carry on burning fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency sees a limited role for carbon capture in energy-hungry sectors such as steelmaking, which can’t yet be effectively powered by renewables like wind and solar. Another “loophole” that has angered some countries and climate experts is the agreement’s recognition of a continued role for “transitional fuels” — largely interpreted to mean methane gas, a planet-heating fossil fuel. Several climate negotiators and international groups called the final text historic and significant, while also being careful to say it does not go far enough or fast enough to rein in the climate crisis. “The message coming out of this COP is we are moving away from fossil fuels,” US climate envoy John Kerry told reporters at a Wednesday press conference. While he acknowledged the final agreement represented a compromise, he called it a success and a vindication of multilateralism. “We’re not turning back,” he added. Other observers noted the text gives leeway to fossil fuel producers. Tom Evans, a policy advisor at E3G, told CNN “there are some good elements in here but the signal on fossil fuels is muddled – it recognizes that we are turning away from fossil fuels at long last but still too slowly.” The draft “sends a signal that the fossil industry’s days are numbered,” Teresa Anderson, global climate lead at ActionAid, said in a statement. But, she added, it still contains “offers several gifts to the greenwashers, with mentions of carbon capture and storage, so-called transition fuels, nuclear power and carbon markets.” The first day of COP28 opened with a surprise agreement to adopt a climate damage fund that was the result of decades of hard-fought negotiations. Many countries, including COP28 host country the UAE, have since made pledges totaling more than $700 million to help nations hit hardest by the climate crisis deal with its consequences. More announcements on climate finance were made during the rest of the summit; the UAE  pledged to create a $30 billion climate finance fund and put $250 million into it by the end of the decade. During Vice President Kamala Harris’s visit to COP, the US pledged $3 billion towards the Green Climate Fund, the main finance vehicle to help developing nations adapt to the climate crisis and cut fossil fuel pollution. Slashing emissions of methane, a powerful planet-warming gas, was also a sharp focus in the early days of the meeting. The US announced regulations to cut methane pollution from the nation’s huge oil and gas industry by nearly 80% through 2038. And 50 major oil and gas companies, including Exxon and Saudi Aramco, signed a pledge to cut their methane emissions by the end of the decade, each committing to reduce their methane intensity by around 80% to 90% by 2030. Now the deal is agreed, countries are required to update their national plans in 2025 to reduce emissions, detailing how much they’ll cut down on planet-warming pollution by 2035. The US and China, the world’s two biggest emitters, have already jointly committed that their plans will cover all economy-wide climate pollution, and reduce emissions from non-CO2 gases such as methane and hydrofluorocarbons. That agreement marked a major commitment from China, in particular, which emits more carbon dioxide than the rest of the developed world combined. Speaking Wednesday, Kerry said the two countries were actively encouraging the rest of the world’s nations to follow. But Kerry warned that more ambition was needed to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. “That’s our challenge. Speed it up; bring it to scale – bigger, faster,” Kerry said. Attention will now move to next year’s summit. After a fraught selection process, Azerbaijan, another major oil and gas producing nation, was tapped to host the 2024 talks."

This year’s forecast is your nightmare,12-13-2023,                                                 White Christmas weather dreams are being dashed across the US by this year’s temperature forecast.                                             ,"Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","As Christmas nears, daydreams grow of presents under decked-out trees, a mug full of hot cocoa and an idyllic white Christmas with snow-lined streets. But snowy dreams are being dashed across the US by this year’s temperature forecast. The new temperature outlook predicts above-average temperatures for almost the entire US – including Hawaii and a large portion of Alaska – from December 20 to 26, according to the Climate Prediction Center. At least 1 inch of snow needs to be on the ground where you live on December 25 in order for you to say it was a white Christmas. Above-average temperatures would threaten to stifle the freezing conditions necessary for existing snow to stick to the ground and increase the chances of any new precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow. For most of the US, the above-average temperatures are tied to warm, moist Pacific air forecast to be pumped east across the US via the jet stream – a river of air high in the atmosphere that transports storms. The position of the jet stream and the influx of warm air are a clear signal of El Niño, a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific that influences weather around the globe. In the US, El Niño manifests as warmer conditions across the northern US and wetter conditions across the West and South. While El Niño is a natural climate variation, climate change is accelerating warming on a much larger scale and threatening white Christmases to come. Following months of record-breaking heat, 2023 will be the hottest on record globally, a recent analysis confirmed. Conditions that could be warmer than average are only one factor throwing a wrench in snow hopes. Storms with plenty of moisture are also necessary to get more accumulating snow. Plenty of moisture is forecast across much of the West and a large portion of the Plains by Christmas, but it’s unclear if storms will be able to take advantage of it. Even with increased precipitation chances, the above average temperatures signal a higher likelihood for rain rather than snow. Mother Nature isn’t a total Grinch, so snow isn’t impossible this Christmas. But this temperature forecast makes the chances of seeing a white Christmas much lower when compared to average. Even if average temperatures were forecast, the number of places in the US likely to have a white Christmas is historically limited. Mountain ranges in the West and Northeast typically are most likely to meet the white Christmas definition but also have some of the smallest populations able to experience the wonder. More populous cities in the northern Plains and Upper Midwest on average are more likely to experience a white Christmas. Minneapolis typically has about a 75% chance of a white Christmas, but the chances drop dramatically a few hours to the south. The greater Chicago area has about a 30 to 40% chance of a white Christmas on average. In the East, Philadelphia and New York City have a 10% to 15% chance of a white Christmas. Both cities haven’t had an inch of snow fall in a single day in nearly two years – record long snow droughts likely to continue through Christmas. Exact temperatures and precipitation amounts will come into focus across the US as Christmas gets closer, providing a better picture of this year’s snow chances. So, hold out hope for a white Christmas in the meantime, even if those hopes look likely to melt away."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","The major gas leak from the sabotaged Nord Stream pipeline last year pushed Sweden’s annual planet-heating emissions up by 7%, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency reported Thursday. The agency’s estimates show the largest part of the 2022 leak occurred within Denmark’s economic zone, but a whopping 5.8 million tons of climate pollution spilled within Sweden’s economic zone. Without the Nord Stream leak, Sweden’s climate emissions would have actually been down 5% from 2021 levels. The pollution was in the form of methane, the main component of the fossil-fuel gas people use to fuel stoves and heat homes, which has more than 80 times more warming power in the short-term than carbon dioxide. This gas can seep into the atmosphere from landfills, livestock and the oil and gas industry, particularly with pipeline leaks. The September 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which pumped methane gas from Russia to Germany, was a major flashpoint in the energy war between Europe and Russia. Amid its invasion of Ukraine, Russia halted all gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 at the time, blaming Western sanctions for causing technical difficulties. Authorities have yet to determine who was behind the sabotage. At the time of the leak, UN Environment Programme detected on satellite a massive plume of concentrated methane. It later reported the ruptures were likely the largest single release of methane ever recorded. Slashing methane emissions was a sharp focus in the early days of the recent UN COP28 climate summit in Dubai. Scientists have said that curtailing methane is the easiest and fastest way to change the path of rising global temperatures in the coming years due to its intense warming power. Clarification: This story has been updated to note the leak spilled methane in Sweden’s economic zone."

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","A potent storm will track from the Gulf of Mexico into Florida and move north up the East Coast this weekend, bringing with it the chance of flooding rainfall and gusty winds for much of the eastern United States. The storm’s exact track and strength as it moves through Florida and into the Southeast Saturday are still unclear and will determine the storm’s severity in spots all the way to New England into next week. Two scenarios are possible; one that pulls the storm toward the Florida Panhandle and then more inland, and one that brings it into the Florida Peninsula and then closer to the coast. For now, the threat of flooding rain and gusty winds is most pronounced in Florida, parts of the Gulf Coast and the Southeast on Saturday. Additional threats may also develop, including severe thunderstorms and coastal hazards like flooding and rip currents. In preparation for the severe weather, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis activated the state guard Friday, his office said in a news release. DeSantis also directed the state’s division of emergency management to prepare equipment needed to help residents who may experience flooding, strong wind gusts and tornadoes, the release said. The forecast should become clearer by Friday, but for now, here’s what each scenario could unleash this weekend. Heavy rain will begin Saturday and continue through Saturday night across much of Florida in both scenarios. But in scenario one, the track of the storm brings most of the flooding rain straight to the state’s peninsula, reducing the risk in the panhandle. A slight risk, or Level 2 of 4, of excessive rainfall is forecast for the Florida Peninsula on Saturday, while a marginal risk, or Level 1 of 4, is forecast for the Florida Panhandle, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Rain could fall heavily enough on Saturday to trigger flash flooding, especially across South Florida where it’ll continue to be quite soggy through the week’s end. The heavy rain will also be accompanied by gusty winds, with the strongest winds arriving Saturday evening as the center of the storm closes in on the Florida coast. Widespread wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph are possible across much of the Florida Peninsula through Saturday night in this scenario, with stronger gusts possible at the coast. Strong wind gusts will also push water ashore and produce coastal flooding, especially along Florida’s Gulf Coast. Dangerous surf and rip currents are also likely through the weekend across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, Florida Keys and the southeast Atlantic coast. As if drenching rainfall, strong winds and coastal flooding weren’t enough, a few severe thunderstorms may rumble to life late Saturday across the Florida Peninsula. These storms may produce tornadoes, but it’s not a guarantee given the complexity of the forecast. On Sunday, the storm tracks northeast and moves out of Florida to hug the Southeast coast, which could mean the heaviest rain and strongest wind sets up closer to the coast. The storm will spread rain across more of the Southeast by late Saturday and rain will become drenching by Sunday. Enough rain could fall to cause flash flooding in Georgia and the Carolinas. The storm could continue to move along the coast into the Northeast, which typically means gusty, stormy weather for the region. This scenario is slightly less likely than the first scenario, but some computer forecast models say it’s still a possibility. In it, the Gulf storm makes a beeline for the Florida Panhandle on Saturday, unloading the worst of its rain there. This track also places more of southern Georgia and southern Alabama in the heaviest rain threat. This scenario’s track, which is more western, moves the location of Saturday’s strongest winds into more of the Florida Panhandle. Breezy conditions are still likely across the peninsula in this scenario, but gusts may not be as strong or as frequent. Coastal impacts could expand along more of Florida’s Gulf Coast if this scenario were to play out. A storm closer to the Panhandle could drive winds directly into the coast from South Florida into the state’s Big Bend region and lead to expansive coastal flooding. Rough seas and dangerous rip currents are also likely in this scenario. The storm may then track northward along the spine of the Appalachians Saturday night through Sunday and spread heavy rain much farther inland than the first scenario. Rain is still likely across much of the Carolinas, but it may be less intense. Monday will be a sloppy day with plenty of rain across much of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast as the storm tracks north, regardless of its final track."

","Anna Cooban, CNN","Global coal demand is likely to have peaked this year, and could drop by about 2% over the next three years as China brings more renewable energy sources online, the International Energy Agency said Friday. It’s the first time the Paris-based agency has predicted a drop in appetite for the dirty fuel over a three-year period. Demand is on track to peak at 8.54 billion metric tons (9.4 billion tons) this year, surpassing the previous record of 8.42 billion metric tons hit in 2022, the IEA said in its annual coal market report. The agency expects demand to start falling in 2024, and to drop by 2.3% by the end of 2026. Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s director of energy markets and security, said the forecast showed that “a turning﻿ point for coal is clearly on the horizon.” “We have seen declines in global coal demand a few times, but they were brief and caused by extraordinary events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union or the Covid-19 crisis,” he said in a press release. “This time appears different, as the decline is more structural, driven by the formidable and sustained expansion of clean energy technologies.” More than half of the renewable energy capacity coming online in the next three years will be in China, the IEA said. The country currently accounts for over half of global demand for coal, according to the agency. A new global climate deal, agreed Wednesday at the COP28 summit, makes an unprecedented call for countries to transition away from fossil fuels, but uses vague language that could allow some governments to take minimal action. The agreement falls short of requiring the world to “phase out” oil, coal and natural gas — something more than 100 countries and many climate groups had been calling for. The IEA expects coal demand to have fallen this year in nearly all advanced economies, driven by a record plunge of around 20% in both the European Union and the United States. However, demand is moving east and is forecast to have risen by about 5% in China this year and by more than 8% in India because of strong growth in electricity needs and low hydropower output. While overall the world is on track to reduce its appetite for coal over the next three years, a lot hinges on China’s ability to expand its clean energy capacity, the IEA said. “The availability of hydropower is a key variable in the short term, since coal is used as a substitute when hydro underperforms in China,” the agency wrote in its report, adding that the country would “have the last word.” Last week, the Chinese government issued an action plan to improve air quality, promising to “vigorously develop new and clean energy” and strictly control coal use. With the aim of cutting the density of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 by 10% by 2025 compared with 2020 levels, the plan calls for a greater role for non-fossil fuel energy, promoting electric vehicles and moving more freight around the country by rail and waterways rather than by road. The IEA said global coal consumption would still be well over 8 billion metric tons in 2026, and that the use of “unabated coal” would need to fall “significantly faster” than its current rate of decline to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Unabated coal refers to the burning of coal without capturing and storing its planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions, an IEA spokesperson told reporters. Laura He contributed to this article."

Read more CNN opinion here. Q: How many climate change deniers does it take to change a lightbulb? A: What are you talking about, the bulb is fine. See, despite the post-COP28 despondency, it is possible to laugh in the face of climate change. In fact, not only is it possible, it is essential. What we needed from the climate summit in Dubai was a binding commitment to cut emissions in half within six years, so as to have any chance of keeping the global average temperature rise (compared to pre-industrial times) this side of 1.5°C, and side-stepping dangerous, all pervasive, climate breakdown. What we got was a vague intention to transition away from fossil fuels — no timeline, no roadmap. It was the sort of outcome that elicits a chuckle and a shaking of the head in disbelief. But chuckling is a healthy response, even when things seem bleak — especially then, in fact. Comedy and humor have long been tried and trusted ways of coping with hard times. They can help to relieve stress, distract the mind from the problems of the moment, and bolster general well-being, all things we now need more than ever. In World War II, comedy was utilised to belittle Hitler and reduce him to a figure of ridicule that morphed him in the public’s perception from a monster into a joke; from someone to be feared to someone who could be beaten. Those suffering the devastating nightly carpet bombing of British cities in 1940 and 1941 fought back in the only way they could, with laughter. The so-called Blitz ‘spirit’ depended upon a good dose of black humor, which I am sure continues to play a key role in lifting the mood, today, in war zones like Ukraine. Whenever times are difficult, people resort to wit and repartee. The reason is simple. If you don’t laugh, you will cry, and that marks the beginning of a very slippery slope. As civilization faces a threat that dwarfs that of every war ever fought combined, and the outcome of the latest climate COP offers little hope, it’s something we need — not only to remember — but to actively adopt as a weapon in our armoury to fight for a better future for our children and their children. They say that laughter is the best medicine, but weaponised comedy has the potential to do more than just make us feel good. Not only can it help inform and educate about global heating and the climate breakdown it is driving, but also to encourage and bolster action. Fortunately, this is happening. Because comedy can engage people in ways that other approaches to climate change can’t, it can be an effective way of getting the message across. This is why ventures like “Climate Science Translated,” which I took part in earlier this year, are so important. The British-based project — brainchild of ethical insurer Nick Oldridge and the climate communications outfit Utopia Bureau — teams climate scientists up with comedians, who ‘translate’ the science into bite-sized, funny and pretty irreverent chunks that can be understood, digested and appreciated by anyone. Four film shorts have now been made — all of which can be viewed on Youtube — the first ‘starring’ me and brilliant comedian and actor, Kiri Pritchard-McLean. You can take my word for it, that “we are understating some major potential risks and tipping points.” Or you might prefer Kiri’s translation: “Even the craziest predictions probably aren’t crazy enough. You thought it was bad, well it’s a lot worse than that.” As Kiri pointedly observes: “If comedians are helping scientists out, you know things aren’t going well.” Elsewhere, a number of stand-ups have devised routines around global heating and climate breakdown — including the excellent Lara Ricote, who won the 2022 best newcomer award at the prestigious British comedy festival, Edinburgh Fringe, and Stuart Goldsmith’s climate-focused “Spoilers” routine, which launched at this year’s festival. There is even a “Sustainable Stand-up” course aimed at teaching comedy beginners about how climate and social issues can be addressed in their shows, and which has run in 11 countries. In the US, the Climate Comedy Cohort brings together comedians to develop new routines informed by the hottest climate science, and take their work on the road in a series of live shows and short-form video. Some climate professionals have even taken things into their own hands, like Scotsman Dr. Matt Winning, who has a PhD in climate policy, and uses stand-up to get his message across: “My idea is that we make more people afraid of flying — so we need to put big glass floors on planes….” It might sound as if plenty is happening but, as the climate continues to collapse about our ears, it is clear that more is needed — much more. The world’s biggest climate joke has just ended in the United Arab Emirates, where more than 80,000 delegates — including 2,400 from the fossil fuel sector, have conspired to take the mickey. Nearly three decades of climate COPs have done nothing to reduce emissions, nor rein-in ever-climbing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The UK Met Office has just predicted that the global average temperature rise could touch 1.5°C next year, yet the COP28 final communique is still banging on about how we can still avoid a permanent rise above this critical threshold, while at the same time failing to show how. COP28 was always set to be a bit of a comedy show, and one that even the best comic writers would find hard to make up. Held in a major petrostate, the colossal wealth of which is predicated upon fossil fuel extraction, and which has no vested interest in slashing the carbon dioxide emissions that result from burning them, the conference was presided over by the head of the country’s national oil company. Papers leaked in advance revealed that the UAE planned to use the opportunity provided by the meeting to set up new oil and gas deals, while — half way through — it emerged that the COP president had made a vigorous defence of fossil fuels, arguing that dumping them would see us back living in caves. You have to laugh — the sort of slightly hysterical laugh that quickly turns to weeping. Oh, and to add to the fun, the host for next year’s COP29 is going to be Azerbaijan — another big oil producer. Rather than making progress on tackling the climate emergency, then, we are at the very least standing still, and quite possibly going backwards. A role for comedy in helping to turn things around has never been more urgent. So let’s see more comedians build the climate emergency into their shows, and let’s get the really big hitters involved. Come on Bill Bailey, Lee Mack, Steve Coogan, Ricky Gervais, Jack Dee and the rest. It’s your world too. And what about a climate sit-com — surely it’s time has come? “Last of the Summer Heatwave” anyone, or perhaps “Only Fools and Climate Scientists”? I know — “Third Overheating Rock from the Sun.”"

As president and CEO of global think-tank International Crisis Group (ICG), Comfort Ero has plenty of experience in the field. Ero has spearheaded the conflict resolution non-profit since 2021, after stints working at the United Nations, and before that, at the ICG’s West Africa project. Born in England to Nigerian parents, she has lived and worked on the African continent, and been heavily involved in peacekeeping operations in Liberia. One of the areas monitored by the ICG is the impact of the climate crisis as a destabilizing factor for Africa – especially for the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa – and the organization has pushed for leaders to consider mitigation strategies. Last weekend, halfway through the COP28 climate summit, CNN spoke to Ero at Doha Forum, an annual meeting of policy leaders in the Qatari capital, about the action she hopes to see from today’s leaders. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: Have the effects of climate change been an obstacle when it comes to conflict resolution in Africa? Ero: I wouldn’t say it’s an obstacle. It’s one of the key issues that we have to grapple with. Countries that are already affected by conflict and violence also have to deal with issues around drought and flooding. Whether it’s in the Horn of Africa writ large or the Sahel, one of the challenges that we face is how to manage competition over resourcing; how to deal with displacement caused by climatic shocks like drought and flood; and to deal with that in the context of violence and conflict and instability. What should world leaders be doing more of in that case? We have to take (climate change) seriously. It is existential; it’s transnational. We’ve got to think not just about loss and damage, but we’ve got to think about how to support countries to deal with adaptation and resilience. Money is required not just to deal with loss and damage – and it’s great that that was put on the agenda – but we’ve got to think now about the capabilities and capacities for countries that are dealing with multiple challenges going forward. What are you hoping to see as a result of this year’s Doha Forum? To see more investment in diplomacy. To give diplomacy a chance rather than assuming that you can resolve a conflict through military confrontation. That there’s more listening, more understanding, and there’s more empathy on both sides in conflicts.

","Mary Gilbert and Taylor Ward, CNN","A powerful storm started drenching Florida Saturday and is expected to strengthen as it tracks up the East Coast through the weekend, unleashing heavy rainfall, gusty winds and coastal hazards along the way. A blockbuster snowstorm is not expected, despite the time of year, but this very warm, wet and blustery storm could still snarl early holiday travel and knock out power. Computer forecasting models show the storm’s track hugging the Atlantic coast on Sunday and Monday after moving through Florida on Saturday. Across most of Florida, some 17 million people are under threat of severe weather Saturday, in large cities including Jacksonville, Tampa and Orlando. It rained across most of the state by Saturday evening as wet weather began spreading into southern Georgia. Most of the threat is from possible tornadoes and strong winds. The peak risk level is 2 out of 5. Millions more face similar threats Sunday into the Carolinas, including Wilmington in North Carolina and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina. Here’s what to expect each day: By Saturday night, heavy rainfall is forecast to drench almost the entire state of Florida and spread into the Southeast. A slight risk of excessive rainfall – or Level 2 out of 4 – is forecast for a majority of Florida and far southern Georgia on Saturday. Rain could fall heavily enough on Saturday to trigger flash flooding and may cause streams and rivers to rise. South Florida is particularly vulnerable to flash flooding following multiple rounds of soaking rainfall this week, but it can occur anywhere there is a persistent deluge. The heavy rain will also be accompanied by gusty winds, with the strongest winds arriving Saturday evening as the center of the storm closes in on the Florida coast. Widespread wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph are possible across much of the Florida Peninsula through Saturday night. Stronger gusts are likely at the coast, but will depend on the exact track the storm takes as it approaches the Florida coast on Saturday, which is still unclear. A slight deviation in the storm’s path north or south as it moves toward the Florida Peninsula will shift where the strongest winds occur and will make a significant difference in the location and extent of coastal flooding. Damaging wind gusts and a few tornadoes are possible late Saturday and overnight across the Florida Peninsula. A Level 2 out of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms includes Tampa and Miami. On Sunday, the storm will track northeast out of Florida and hug the East Coast, expanding its impacts from Georgia to portions of the Northeast. A slight risk of excessive rainfall – or Level 2 out of 4 – is forecast Sunday from parts of South Carolina north into portions of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The heaviest rain during the day will target the Carolinas and coastal Georgia as the storm strengthens and begins to accelerate up the coast. Rain will begin across the mid-Atlantic and parts of the Northeast by Sunday afternoon, but the heaviest will arrive late Sunday and Sunday night. Flood watches cover areas that include more than 60 million people, including in Miami, Jacksonville, Washington, DC, Philadelphia and New York. Rainfall rates are expected to be low enough to limit flash flooding, but hours of steady rainfall will lead to the potential of flooding in urban areas as well as locations with poor drainage. Smaller rivers and streams will also be prone to minor to moderate levels of flooding, according to the National Weather Service. Strong wind gusts will slam coastal areas from the Southeast through the mid-Atlantic on Sunday and the coastal Northeast on Sunday night. Frequent gusts of 40 to 50 mph are possible for much of the coast while inland areas will be breezy, but spared the worst winds. The combination of strong winds and heavy rainfall will likely slow travel across a significant portion of the region, especially the busy I-95 corridor. Gusty winds and reduced visibilities may delay some air travel. The storm will reach its peak strength on Monday, just in time to deliver disruption to a large portion of the Northeast. It is forecast to track very close to the Northeast coast during this time but could also move more away from the coast. Regardless of its exact track, the storm will bring nor’easter-like impacts to the coastal Northeast on Monday – minus the snow. The heaviest rain and strongest winds will likely center on New England on Monday, but wet and breezy conditions will be the norm for a majority of the Northeast. Wind gusts up to 60 mph are possible along the New England coast starting early Monday morning and along coastal Maine by Monday afternoon. Winds this strong mean power outages are possible in the region, especially when coupled with heavy rainfall that soaks soils and makes trees easier to topple. Wind-driven coastal flooding is also possible and could become significant if the timing aligns with high tides."

","Pete Muntean, CNN","Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is warning that bad weather could disrupt holiday air travel. “We may see some bad weather around the holidays,” Buttigieg said, alongside FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker during a press conference at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C. “Winter weather may be a challenge, and it will certainly be a challenge in the next few weeks,” Buttigieg said. The FAA has opened military airspace over the holidays and is cooperating with the commercial space industry to limit private launches. It has opened 169 new East Coast routes to keep traffic moving smoothly. Buttigieg stressed that 2023 has seen the lowest commercial flight cancellation rate in the last five years and airlines performed admirably over the Thanksgiving travel rush, but he said he still wants to see the number of delays come down. He told reporters that airlines can’t control weather, but that there’s a “tipping point” where there are additional cancellations and delays that the airlines can control. Buttigieg said he wants to hold them accountable for those disruptions. On Monday, the Department of Transportation fined Southwest Airlines $140 million for its massive 10-day-long meltdown that started last December 21 and led to the cancellation of 16,900 flights, stranding two million passengers. Newly installed FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said his focus has been air safety since starting the job eight weeks ago. The agency has been repeatedly criticized for the shortage of roughly 3,000 air traffic controllers. “We know we need more air traffic controllers and are working hard to hire them,” Whitaker stated. Whitaker announced in early spring that the general public will be invited to apply to the FAA air traffic control training center in Oklahoma City. Buttigieg also noted that the threat of a government shutdown in January “will imperil all the progress we’ve made” on bolstering air travel. “That will stop training and hiring that will have impacts and will lead to disruptions in air travel,” Buttigieg said. “I’m hopeful we get the support we need from Congress.”"

Meanwhile, the surprising reality is the United States ...","Matt Egan, CNN","As the world grapples with the existential crisis of climate change, environmental activists want President Joe Biden to phase out the oil industry, and Republicans argue he’s already doing that. Meanwhile, the surprising reality is the United States is pumping oil at a blistering pace and is on track to produce more oil than any country has in history. The United States is set to produce a global record of 13.3 million barrels per day of crude and condensate during the fourth quarter of this year, according to a report published Tuesday by S&P Global Commodity Insights. Last month, weekly US oil production hit 13.2 million barrels per day, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That’s just above the Donald Trump-era record of 13.1 million set in early 2020 just before the Covid-19 crisis sent output and prices crashing. That’s been helping to keep a lid on crude and gasoline prices. US output – led by shale oil drillers in Texas and New Mexico’s Permian Basin – is so strong that it’s sending supplies overseas. America is exporting the same amount of crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids as Saudi Arabia or Russia produces, S&P said. “It’s a reminder that the US is endowed with enormous oil reserves. Our industry should never be underestimated,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group. Record-shattering US production is helping to offset aggressive supply cuts meant to support high prices by OPEC+, mainly Saudi Arabia and Russia. Other non-OPEC oil producers including Canada and Brazil are also pumping more oil than ever before. (Brazil is set to join OPEC+ next year.) The strength of US output has caught experts off guard. Goldman Sachs analysts on Sunday cut their forecast for oil prices next year. The bank said the “key reason” behind the lowered forecast is the abundance of US supply. Global demand for crude oil is set to hit a record in 2024 – but it will “easily be met” by the growth in supply, according to S&P’s projections. All of this has helped to keep oil prices relatively in check. After flirting with $100 a barrel earlier this year, crude has since tumbled back to the $70 to $75 range. Energy prices have jumped this week after BP halted shipments through the Red Sea due to security concerns. Still, US oil is trading below $74 a barrel, well below where it was when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. Gas prices neared the psychologically important level of $4 a gallon in September. But prices at the pump have since fallen sharply, helping to ease inflationary pressure on the US economy. The national average for a gallon of regular gas stood at $3.08 a gallon on Tuesday, down from $3.14 a year ago, according to AAA. Despite record-setting production, Biden has come under fire for his energy policy. “Unfortunately, this Administration continues to pursue policies designed to limit access to new production—most notably on federal lands and waters. The world will continue to demand more energy, not less, and we urge policymakers to recognize the role American energy production can play as a stabilizing force for consumers here at home and around the world,” American Petroleum Institute Senior Vice President of Policy, Economics and Regulatory Affairs Dustin Meyer, said in a statement on Tuesday. In September, the House subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources held a hearing titled: “Biden’s War on Domestic Energy Threatens Every American.” Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska warned in a floor speech that the Biden administration’s war on energy is a “gift to our adversaries.” Earlier this month at a GOP presidential primary debate, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis vowed to “open up all of our domestic energy for production” to “lower your gas prices.” DeSantis made a similar comment at the CNN town hall last week. That the US is about to produce more oil than any country ever before undercuts the argument that Biden has waged a war on American energy. Of course, that doesn’t mean it’s Biden policies that have paved the way for record US oil production, nor that the White House would rush to take credit for that. McNally, a former energy official to former President George W. Bush, said there isn’t that much presidents can do about US oil production, short of taking drastic emergency powers. Unlike OPEC nations, the United States oil output is largely set by the free market. “It’s not like President Biden or any president has a dial in the Oval Office to increase production,” McNally said. Instead, the spike in US output has been driven by smarter and more efficient operations by oil companies. Energy firms have figured out ways to squeeze more and more oil out of the ground – often without increasing drilling dramatically. The shale oil revolution has been driven by new drilling techniques that have unlocked new resources. But this technique can be more complex and requires vast amounts of water. Yet McNally said the White House has been forced to shift its tone on fossil fuels from the climate-focused stance of 2020 and early 2021 to something more neutral. Last year, gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which set off a panic in the oil market. Biden urged US oil companies to pump more oil – exactly the opposite of what climate scientists are calling for. In March, the Biden administration even approved the Willow oil drilling project, a controversial ConocoPhillips drilling venture in Alaska that had been stalled for decades. That green light came in the face of deep criticism from climate groups worried about the environmental and health risks. “President Biden has been dragged kicking and screaming from his initial keep-it-in-the-ground strategy towards a more pragmatic policy,” McNally said, noting the administration was “mugged by the reality of high gas prices and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”"

Old-growth forests in particular tend to have a higher carbon density, which the USDA says makes them well suited to store more carbon than younger forests. The proposal, the White House said Tuesday, falls under a 2022 Earth Day Executive Order from President Joe Biden aimed at tackling the climate crisis and strengthening climate resilience. In addition, for the first time since 2007, the National Forest Service is updating its Northwest Forest Plan, which guides management of roughly one quarter of the continental United States’ federally managed forests, all located in Washington, Oregon and California, to better prepare for climate resilience."
https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/20/climate/nuclear-fusion-energy-breakthrough-replicate-climate/index.html,Scientists successfully replicate historic nuclear fusion breakthrough three times,12-21-2023,"                                                 Scientists in California make a significant step in what could one day be an important solution to the global climate crisis, driven primarily by burning fossil fuels.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","Scientists in California shooting nearly 200 lasers at a cylinder holding a fuel capsule the size of a peppercorn have taken another step in the quest for fusion energy, which, if mastered, could provide the world with a near-limitless source of clean power. Last year on a December morning, scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California (LLNL) managed, in a world first, to produce a nuclear fusion reaction that released more energy than it used, in a process called “ignition.” Now they say they have successfully replicated ignition at least three times this year, according to a December report from the LLNL. This marks another significant step in what could one day be an important solution to the global climate crisis, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. For decades, scientists have attempted to harness fusion energy, essentially recreating the power of the sun on Earth. After making their historic net energy gain last year, the next important step was to prove the process could be replicated. Brian Appelbe, a research fellow from the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said the ability to replicate demonstrates the “robustness” of the process, showing it can be achieved even when conditions such as the laser or fuel pellet are varied. Each experiment also offers an opportunity to study the physics of ignition in detail, Appelbe told CNN. “This provides valuable information to the scientists in addressing the next challenge to be overcome: how to maximize the energy that can be obtained.” Unlike nuclear fission — the process used in the world’s nuclear plants today, which is generated by the division of atoms —﻿ nuclear fusion leaves no legacy of long-lived radioactive waste. As the climate crisis accelerates, and the urgency of ditching planet-heating fossil fuels increases, the prospect of an abundant source of safe, clean energy is tantalizing. Nuclear fusion, the reaction that powers the sun and other stars, involves smashing two or more atoms together to form a denser one, in a process that releases huge amounts of energy. There are different ways of creating energy from fusion, but at NIF, scientists fire an array of nearly 200 lasers at a pellet of hydrogen fuel inside a diamond capsule the size of a peppercorn, itself inside a gold cylinder. The lasers heat up the cylinder’s outside, creating a series of very fast explosions, generating large amounts of energy collected as heat. The energy produced in December 2022 was small — it took around 2 megajoules to power the reaction, which released a total of 3.15 megajoules, enough to boil around 10 kettles of water. But it was sufficient to make it a successful ignition and to prove that laser fusion could create energy. Since then, the scientists have done it several more times. On July 30, the NIF laser delivered a little over 2 megajoules to the target, which resulted in 3.88 megajoules of energy — their highest yield achieved to date, according to the report. Two subsequent experiments in October also delivered net gains. “These results demonstrated NIF’s ability to consistently produce fusion energy at multi-megajoule levels,” the report said. There is still a very long way to go, however, until nuclear fusion reaches the scale needed to power electric grids and heating systems. The focus now is on building on the progress made and figuring out how to dramatically scale up fusion projects and significantly bring down costs. At the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, US climate envoy John Kerry launched an international engagement plan involving more than 30 countries with the aim of boosting nuclear fusion to help tackle the climate crisis. “There is potential in fusion to revolutionize our world, and to change all of the options that are in front of us, and provide the world with abundant and clean energy without the harmful emissions of traditional energy sources,” Kerry told the climate gathering. In December, the US Department of Energy announced a $42 million investment in a program bringing together multiple institutions, including LLNL, to establish “hubs” focused on advancing fusion. “Harnessing fusion energy is one of the greatest scientific and technological challenges of the 21st Century,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in a statement. “We now have the confidence that it’s not only possible, but probable, that fusion energy can be a reality.” Ella Nilsen and René Marsh contributed to reporting"

","Elisa Raffa, CNN meteorologist","Winter is here, but for most of the United States, it’s feeling less and less like it. At 10:27 p.m. ET on Thursday, Earth’s Northern Hemisphere will be at its greatest tilt from the sun, marking the winter solstice: the shortest day of the year and the official start of the coldest season. But winter is warming rapidly because of human-caused climate change and it’s having an impact on snow, tourism, winter sports, local economies, dinner plates and even allergies. The winter period from December to February is now the fastest-warming of the three-month seasons for nearly 75% of the US, according to an analysis of NOAA temperature data by Climate Central, a nonprofit climate research group. The analysis looked at average winter temperatures for 240 locations across the US and found the winter warming trend covers every corner of the map — temperatures had warmed in 97%, or 233, of the spots since 1970. Winter temperatures increased by 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit on average since 1970 in these warming locations. Winters in the fastest-warming cities have warmed by as much as 7 degrees. The Northeast and Upper Midwest are the regions warming fastest, and are running a nearly 5-degree winter fever. This includes some ski towns like Burlington, Vermont, (7.7 degree increase) and Concord, New Hampshire (6.6 degree increase). Winter in notoriously cold Milwaukee is now 6.7 degrees warmer on average. For many, a little extra winter warmth may sound nice. But milder winters come with consequences. “Wintertime plays important roles in the life cycles of plants, animals, and insects, the recharging of freshwater supplies, and sustaining snow and ice for winter recreation, which supports local economies,” said Lauren Casey, a meteorologist at Climate Central. A warmer winter doesn’t mean it’s sweltering like summer all season long — there will still be cold days in a warmer climate. But the cold of winter will become less frequent and less extreme. As average temperatures rise, it will leave less room for extreme cold swings. Cold snaps across the US are now an average of six days shorter than they were in 1970, Climate Central’s data shows. And though cold temperatures will still occasionally set records, they are far more likely to be outpaced by warm records. There are double the warm temperature records as cold ones in 2023. At night, the discrepancy grows, and there is triple the number of record warm low temperatures compared to record cold ones, NOAA data shows. Overnight minimum temperatures are warming faster in winter than in any other season since records began in 1896. Winter’s overnight temperatures have been warming at a rate of 1.78 degrees per century since 1900 — 25% faster than the rate for winter’s daytime highs, according to CNN analysis of NOAA data. A separate Climate Central analysis of overnight low temperatures at 231 US locations found 88%, or 204 cities, experienced a long-term decrease in the average number of freezing nights each year since 1970. Reno, Nevada, now has 91 fewer freezing nights each year on average, losing more than any other location the list. Cities in Nevada, Arizona, California and Florida that used to see an occasional night below freezing no longer feel the chill at all. Even cities known for cold outbreaks — like Buffalo, New York, Chicago, New York City, Boston, and Detroit — now no longer experience two-to-three weeks’ worth of freezing nights each year. These changes are bad news for several industries that rely on a predictable chill. A study by the International Olympic Committee found rising temperatures may cause ski season to “start up to a month later and finish up to three months earlier,” a finding that threatens to take $1 billion out of the US economy, according to a 2018 study by the climate advocacy group POW and REI. On US farms, the $27 billion fruit and nut industry is losing out on chilling time as winters warm — a necessary exposure for the crops to chilly temperatures which allows them to properly bloom in the spring, another Climate Central analysis found. For example, viable chill time in California’s fertile Central Valley, where 40% of the US’ fruits and nuts are grown, could drop by 25% by the end of the 21st century, the US Department of Agriculture said. With less chill time, there could be less produce like walnuts, pistachios, and cherries to go around, and what’s left is more likely to be of poorer quality, the USDA said. “That, of course, could lead to impacts for food companies, as well as increased food prices which can contribute to or worsen food insecurity,” Casey told CNN. The warmer, longer growing season also increases exposure to pests and pollen, worsening allergies. Worse yet, for winter lovers: The season of sniffles and sneezes will also be here sooner than you might expect — warming winters are causing spring to start weeks ahead of schedule."

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Rain, wind and snow may deal a blow to holiday cheer for some travelers in the central US this weekend, with disruptions possible on the ground and in the air. The 10-day holiday travel period starting Saturday is likely to be the busiest ever at US airports, according to AAA’s year-end holiday forecast. All told, 115 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles from home this holiday season. Here’s what many of them can expect. The West is the not-so-lucky recipient of two simultaneous storms Friday – one in the Southwest and one in the Northwest – and is the region of the US most likely to deal with disrupted travel. The same storm that unloaded gushing rainfall and flooded portions of Southern California on Thursday will expand into the Southwest on Friday. Periods of heavy rainfall will increase flooding concerns across Arizona on Friday and portions of New Mexico by Friday evening. Additional flooding is possible across Southern California on Friday as rain persists. A Level 2 out of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in place Friday for Southern California and much of southern Arizona, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Farther north, a storm that arrived in the Pacific Northwest early Friday morning will track across the Northwest during the day and push into the Rocky Mountains later Friday evening. More than half a foot of snow is likely on Friday in parts of Washington’s Cascade Mountains. This includes the popular Stevens Pass that cuts through the Cascades, which could bring travel to a standstill for drivers without proper snow chains. Rain will fall at lower elevations across the Northwest. Elsewhere, conditions will be dry and largely calm for travelers across the East on Friday. Some rain will stretch from the southern Plains into the Midwest from Friday into Saturday, but heavy, flooding rainfall is unlikely. The two disruptive storms trekking across the West on Friday will combine to form one larger storm over the Rockies on Saturday and impact the central US on Sunday. Travel concerns will ramp up Saturday as accumulating snow falls from Idaho and Montana through Colorado and New Mexico. Anyone driving to see loved ones in the Rockies on Saturday should prepare for a potentially long and snowy trip. Snow will continue across Wyoming and Colorado on Sunday and expand into Nebraska and the Dakotas as the storm pushes into the central US. It’ll take until Saturday night for a mix of rain and snow to arrive in Denver, before changing fully over to snow on Sunday. This snow could turn into quite the headache for last-minute air travelers, especially those headed through Denver International Airport, the busiest hub in the region. Far removed from the snow, rain will stretch from the southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest on Sunday as the storm expands its reach. This rain could be heavy at times, especially for areas closer to the Gulf Coast. A Level 2 out of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is forecast Sunday for more than nine million people across much of Louisiana and portions of Mississippi, Texas and Arkansas. Wet roadways and heavy traffic on Christmas Eve will likely lead to very slow-going travel in metro areas like Dallas and Kansas City. In places like New Orleans where the rain is heaviest, any flooded roadways will bring travel to a halt. Wind speeds will also pick up across the central US on Sunday, and in many places it’ll be breezy with a few stronger wind gusts possible. Flight delays are possible wherever these stronger wind gusts become more frequent. Typically, a large storm in the central US on Christmas Eve would mean snow for a much more expansive swath of the region – but this year is different. Very mild and potentially record-breaking temperatures are set to develop across the region due in part to the influence of El Niño, a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific that influences weather around the globe. Daily high temperature records are in jeopardy across the Upper Midwest on Saturday and across more of the Midwest and Plains on Christmas Eve. Record warmth will likely extend to Christmas Day in the Midwest. The weekend storm will push east on Monday and usher in a mild, soggy Christmas day from the Midwest to the Southeast. Like Sunday, the heaviest rain that could lead to flooding will remain confined to areas near the Gulf Coast on Monday. Rain farther north will be steady at times, but is unlikely to lead to significant flooding concerns. In one of the only cold spots of the storm left by Monday, snow will continue across parts of Nebraska and an icy mix of rain, snow and sleet may impact portions of Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Elsewhere, a dry Christmas Day is in store for a vast majority of the West and the Northeast. To add insult to injury for those whose dreams of a white Christmas have been dashed, this Christmas could set another lackluster snow record. Only 13.2% of mainland US had snow on the ground, known as snow cover, as of Friday morning, according to NOAA. Most of this snow cover is in the Rockies and Cascades, with some in the high terrain of the Northeast. Snowfall across the Rockies this weekend will likely help raise the overall snow coverage percentage slightly. But it may not be enough to prevent this year from having some of the least Christmas snow cover since 2003 when 21.2% of the US had snow on the ground."

Here are the four types of weather most likely to change up your itinerary, ordered from least to most-likely, according to Kyle Struckmann, the head aviation meteorologist for the National Weather Service. Both wind speed and wind direction are critical for safe takeoffs and landings. “Airplanes ideally land and take off directly into the wind,” Struckmann told CNN. Headwinds give a plane the lift and stability necessary for smooth takeoffs and landings. Without them, planes run the risk of not getting off the ground or landing too fast. Airport runways are ideally built to run in the same direction as the airport’s most common wind direction, according to the FAA. This allows aircraft to take off and land into the wind more often. Strong crosswinds – winds that blow across an airplane’s path, rather than toward its nose or tail – can cause tricky or aborted landings by forcing the aircraft to approach the runway at an angle to counterbalance the winds’ force and land level. Crosswinds are a frequent cause of rough landings, Struckmann said. In a more extreme scenario, planes can miss the runway entirely. One such landing played out in California during Tropical Storm Hilary in August. A passenger jet came in for a landing off-kilter during poor weather conditions and struck its left wing on the runway as scared, but unharmed, passengers watched sparks fly. Busy airports have alternate runways for when the wind direction is not ideal, but alternate runways are often shorter and accommodate fewer planes, according to Struckmann. Fewer landings mean longer flight times for planes waiting to land and longer wait times for passengers at the gate waiting for their plane to arrive. Many different types of weather, including dense fog, heavy rainfall with low clouds, and heavy snow, can drop visibility to near-zero and frequently cause delayed takeoffs and landings. Even though pilots use instrumentation to fly safely through clouds when they cannot see, good old-fashioned eyesight is still a necessary fail-safe near a runway. Different airports have different requirements, but to land, pilots need to be able to see enough of the runway to note potential hazards instrumentation may not be able to detect as quickly, according to Struckmann. These potential hazards include other aircraft being where they’re not expected to be. In January, two airliners nearly collided at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport after one crossed onto an active runway. Two other near misses happened in the following weeks in Honolulu and Austin, Texas. Snow and ice is one of the most frequent weather hazards from late fall through winter and causes serious issues for planes on the ground and in the air. On the ground, the focus is on clearing runways of slick snow to allow planes to safely grip the surface during takeoffs and landings. In the air, it’s all about keeping ice from accumulating on planes. “When you have ice accumulating on wings, it really significantly affects a plane’s performance,” Struckmann said. When ice gathers on an aircraft, it can distort the flow of air over the wings – disrupting the lift that keeps planes in the air – and make a plane heavier. Too much ice can cause an airplane to roll or maneuver uncontrollably, according to the FAA. Clouds are made up of water droplets. These droplets can freeze and cause ice to accumulate on a plane when it flies through clouds at a height where temperatures are below freezing. “If planes have to descend through [freezing conditions] then ideally the plane needs to move through it as fast as possible to get down to a lower altitude where it’s above freezing,” Struckmann explained. Back on the ground, deicing clears any ice or snow build up off a plane so it can operate safely. This process can delay takeoffs, but it beats not being able to lift off at all or losing control mid-flight. While more common in spring and summer, the holiday season is not immune to thunderstorms. A secondary severe weather season develops in November and December due to the clash of still-warm air from the Gulf of Mexico with very chilly air diving south out of Canada. The resulting thunderstorms are “very dangerous” for air travel, Struckmann said. This is due to the “severe turbulence caused by updrafts, downdrafts, winds and hail.” Thunderstorms contain both updrafts and downdrafts, fast-moving columns of air that rush up into the atmosphere and down toward the surface, respectively. These quickly-changing winds create severe turbulence and, in addition to hail and lightning, can batter an aircraft in flight. Turbulence can cause a bumpy ride, severe shaking and sudden drops that can lead to injuries. At its worst, turbulence can hinder a plane’s ability to fly by altering its speed or altitude and even cause it to crash, according to the World Meteorological Organization. To avoid damage and potential passenger injuries, planes typically take a longer flight plan that travels around – rather than through – thunderstorms to avoid the hazards found within the disruptive storms. This leads to more time spent in the air and later arrivals back on the ground, which may delay subsequent flights. During the spring, flying earlier in the day before thunderstorms rumble to life in the heat of the afternoon can help avoid delays."

But amid the gloom, there have also been signs of progress.                                             ","Sophie Tanno, CNN","There has been no shortage of bleak climate news this year: unprecedented global heat fueled deadly extreme weather events, scientists issued dire warnings that next year may be worse still, and the world’s carbon pollution kept rising. But amid the gloom, there have also been signs of progress. Renewable energy records have been set, the world celebrated one of its greatest environmental wins and countries made a cautious but historic step towards a fossil fuel-free future. Here are five reasons to be hopeful. As the need to rapidly wean off planet-heating fossil fuels becomes increasingly urgent, there have been some clean energy bright spots around the world. On Halloween, Portugal started a record-breaking streak. For more than six days straight, between October 31 to November 6, the nation of more than 10 million people relied solely on renewable energy sources — setting an exciting example for the rest of the world. The year 2023 is on track to see the biggest increase in renewable energy capacity to date, according to the International Energy Agency. China, the world’s biggest climate polluter, has made lightning advances in renewables, with the country set to shatter its wind and solar target five years early. A report published in June found that China’s solar capacity is now greater than the rest of the world’s nations combined, in a surge described by the report’s author, Global Energy Monitor, as “jaw-dropping.” It can’t be ignored, however, that China also ramped up its coal production this year, turning to the fossil fuel as devastating heat waves increased energy demand for air conditioning and cooling, and as persistent drought in the country’s south impacted hydroelectric supplies, which are reliant on sufficient rainfall. Hopes were raised that the country’s coal production will peak and come down soon, when China and the US in November announced they would resume cooperation on climate change, pledging a major ramp-up of renewable energy, specifically to replace fossil fuels. After more than two weeks of fraught negotiations, the COP28 climate summit in Dubai concluded in December with nearly 200 countries making an unprecedented commitment to move away from fossil fuels. While the agreement fell short of requiring the world to phase out coal, oil and gas — which more than 100 countries had supported — it did call on countries to “contribute” to a “transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems.” This marked the first time that all fossil fuels, the main drivers of the climate crisis, were targeted in a COP agreement. COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, who presided over the negotiations, called the agreement “historic,” adding that the deal represented “a paradigm shift that has the potential to redefine our economies.” How impactful this deal ultimately is will depend on what countries do next to implement it. Many experts warned of loopholes that could leave the door open to a continued expansion of fossil fuels. But that a deal was struck at all on fossil fuels was widely welcomed seen as a breakthrough. “We got people to do things they haven’t done before,” US climate envoy John Kerry told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour after the summit, describing it as a “historic success.” After years of soaring deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, there was good progress this year in reducing forest destruction. The Amazon is the world’s biggest rainforest and its protection is seen as vital to curbing climate change. It acts a carbon sink that sucks in planet-heating pollution from the atmosphere. When forests or trees are destroyed, they emit greenhouse gases. Deforestation and land degradation is responsible for at least one-tenth of the world’s carbon pollution. Deforestation in Brazil fell by 22.3% in the 12 months through July, according to data from the national government, as President Luiz Ignácio Lula da Silva started to make progress on his pledge to rein in the rampant forest destruction that occurred under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Marcio Astrini, head of advocacy group Climate Observatory, described it as an “impressive result” that “seals Brazil’s return to the climate agenda.” Still, Brazil’s deforestation rate remained nearly twice that of its all-time low in 2012. Around 9,000 square kilometers of rainforest were destroyed in the period. There’s a long way to go to meet Lula’s pledge to reach zero deforestation by 2030. The Earth’s ozone layer is on track to recover completely within decades, a UN-backed panel of experts announced in January, as ozone-depleting chemicals are phased out across the world. The ozone layer protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet rays, but since the 1980s, scientists have warned about a hole in this shield due to ozone-harming substances, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were used widely in refrigerators, aerosols and solvents. International cooperation has helped stem the damage. A deal known as the Montreal Protocol, which came into force in 1989, began the phase-out of CFCs. The ozone layer’s subsequent recovery has been hailed as one of the world’s greatest environmental achievements. If global policies stay in place, the ozone layer is expected to recover to 1980 levels by 2040 for most of the world, the assessment found. For polar areas, the timeframe for recovery is longer: 2045 over the Arctic and 2066 over the Antarctic. A study published in November, however, cast some doubt on this progress. The paper, published by Nature Communications, found that a hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic “has not only remained large in area, but it has also become deeper throughout most of the Antarctic spring.” But some scientists were skeptical of the study’s findings, saying it relied on too short a time period to draw conclusions about the layer’s long-term health. The popularity of electric vehicles has surged this year, with American sales at an all-time high. People in China and Europe are snapping up EVs in large numbers as well. Electric vehicles — which are better for the planet than gas and diesel-powered cars when they run on renewable energy sources — are key to decarbonizing road transport, which is responsible for around one-sixth of planet-heating pollution globally, according to the International Energy Agency. Americans purchased 1 million fully electric vehicles in 2023, an annual record, according to a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Electric vehicles accounted for about 8% of all new vehicles sales in the US during the first half of 2023, according to the report. In China, EVs accounted for 19% of all vehicle sales, and worldwide, they made up 15% of new passenger vehicle sales. EV sales in Europe were up 47% in the first nine months of 2023, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (EAMA). However, car dealers have warned that sales are dropping off as consumers wait for cheaper models, expected in two to three years’ time."

","Matt Egan, CNN","Gas prices will fall in 2024 for the second year in a row, according to GasBuddy projections shared exclusively with CNN. GasBuddy, which had a forecast for 2023 that proved to be eerily accurate, expects US gas prices will average $3.38 a gallon in the key election year of 2024. That would represent a significant improvement from 2023’s average of $3.51 a gallon and an even bigger drop from 2022’s average of $3.95. Gas prices skyrocketed to record highs that year as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine set off global shockwaves. Even though the Russia-Ukraine war lingers and there is a risk the Israel-Hamas war spills into a regional conflict, GasBuddy is betting drivers will get more relief in 2024. GasBuddy expects Americans will spend about $32 billion less on fuel than in 2023 and $79 billion less than in 2022. “Next year should represent a continued march towards what most Americans would consider normal prices at the pump,” Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis, told CNN in a phone interview. The forecast bodes well for consumers, who remain highly sensitive to swings in the cost of livin﻿g, especially at the gas pump. It also offers a reason for cautious optimism for a White House fighting an uphill battle trying to sell its economic message to a skeptical public. Cheaper gas prices would give the Federal Reserve an even wider runway as it seeks to pull off a rare soft landing of the US economy by taming inflation without starting a recession. The price of gas is closely watched by the Fed but is not included in its “core” inflation gauge. “Gas prices may still be a bit elevated but considering wage growth, it is taking less of Americans’ hard work to pay for that gallon of gasoline,” De Haan said. GasBuddy doesn’t see gas prices averaging $4 a gallon in any single month next year. The monthly national average is expected to top out at $3.67 in May and drop down to $2.99 by December 2024. In the face of a difficult geopolitical landscape, GasBuddy is optimistic about the price outlook for 2024 for one big reason: America is an energy powerhouse. The United States is on pace to pump more oil than any country on record, according to S&P Global Insights. Blockbuster US oil production worries climate scientists and undermines the argument that President Joe Biden has waged a war on US energy. It also provides a cushion for consumers against a dangerous world that is seemingly just one headline away from spiking gas prices. “The US producing record amounts of crude oil translates to lower risk,” De Haan said. Oil prices briefly jumped earlier this month after BP stopped shipping oil through the Red Sea because of a series of attacks on vessels by Houthi militants from Yemen. Although oil prices quickly calmed down, the damage was done for consumers. The national average price for regular gas has climbed to around $3.13 a gallon, according to AAA. That’s up from a recent low of $3.07. In December 2022, GasBuddy projected gas prices would average $3.49 a gallon in 2023. That forecast was nearly spot-on, with actual gas prices averaging $3.51 a gallon so far this year. Of course, like any forecast, this call for lower gas prices in 2024 could prove wrong in either direction. For example, a sudden slowdown for the US economy could sap demand and cause gas prices to tumble, but at the expense of job losses. Alternatively, an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East could threaten energy supplies and spike oil back towards $100 a barrel, catapulting gasoline prices. GasBuddy’s De Haan said one major issue that keeps him up at night is America’s limited refinery capacity. Extreme weather events, including heat waves, have at times knocked aging refineries offline, limiting supply of gasoline. This has been an especially big problem on the West Coast, where it only takes one refinery to go down for prices to surge. As always, another weather-related risk is the threat of a major hurricane that targets Gulf Coast refineries. “You never know when you’ll get a (Hurricane) Katrina or Harvey that will do tremendous damage to low-lying Gulf Coast,” said De Haan. Another big question mark is what OPEC+, the producer alliance led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, will do next. The White House has had a rocky relationship with Saudi Arabia, and ties with Russia remain very frayed. OPEC+ hasn’t been shy about holding back supplies to juice oil prices, at the expense of consumers around the world. “The decaying relationship between top oil producers and the US is a wildcard,” said De Haan."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","As the new year approaches, you might be thinking about buying a bottle of champagne to ring it in with a celebratory “pop.” But the climate crisis could ruin the party, new data suggests. The three grapes used in almost all champagne — chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier — are among hundreds on the brink of extinction, according to Silicon Valley startup ClimateAi, which shared data insights with CNN. That’s because the human-caused climate crisis is warming and altering weather patterns in some of the world’s best-known wine-growing regions, including Champagne in northern France. By 2050, these popular grape varieties may cease to exist, ClimateAi says. Using hundreds of global climate models, satellite data and field data, ClimateAi researchers are able to forecast the future of grapes used to make champagne and sparkling wine around the world. A study published in 2020 warned that the number of regions currently growing wine grapes will shrink by more than half if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The world will breach that threshold this century if deeper, sustained cuts to carbon pollution aren’t made soon, according to the UN Environment Programme. At 4 degrees of warming, up to 85% of these lands would no longer be viable to produce a decent drop. “If we think about champagne specifically, it’s a very unique beverage,” said Will Kletter, vice president of operations and strategy at ClimateAi. “It requires warm, sunny days for robust flavor and cool nights to build up that acidity, which gives it that kind of crisp, refreshing taste that that we love.” He added: “But as the climate warms, those warm sunny days can get maybe a bit too warm, and those cool nights go away.” Global wine production in 2023 was at its lowest in 60 years. A lot of that decline was because of extreme weather events, many of which have been worsened by climate change, according to an annual wine production report by the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV), published in November. Italy dropped from its position as the world’s leading wine maker due to several adverse weather events, including erratic rainfall that triggered downy mildew, as well as floods, hailstorms and drought, the report said. “This is very much a now problem,” Kletter told CNN. “That means more expensive wine, or maybe the wine that’s produced is not of the same quality, and maybe you can’t even access some of the wines that you’re used to enjoying. And that’s a problem that we’re facing today.” At the pace at which the planet is warming, Kletter said wine growers need to start learning how to adapt — and potentially keep an eye out for viable, cooler locations further north — to keep the industry alive and growing. In France’s Champagne region, wine growers in 2021 saw their smallest harvest since 1957 due to extreme weather events, from extreme heat to early frosting, as well as heavy rainfall, according to a Reuters report. This cost France a total of roughly $2 billion in sales, the report said. But France has had a decent production year in 2023, producing well in the north, including in Champagne, the OIV report said, even though some vineyards in the south were hit with downy mildew, heat waves and drought. Dave and Lois Cho moved from California to Oregon’s Willamette Valley to start a winery in 2020, a particularly challenging year as the western US faced a historic, multi-year drought that triggered unprecedented water shortages and land-scarring wildfires. “Climate change definitely was a factor,” Lois told CNN, when explaining why the couple left. The pair, who founded CHO Wines, initially looked at different wine-making regions in California but heard from growers of having difficulties with erratic rainfall patterns to irrigate their grapes. They were determined to find a site with high elevation. That’s because a vineyard higher up will be cooler and receive more rain. It also means that grapes won’t ripen too early, as they do in the heat, allowing for more flavor and acidity to develop. “Being up at 1,000-feet elevation, which is a pretty high elevation for a lot of valleys still, that was a huge consideration,” Dave told CNN. “Now, we are on average five to 10 degrees cooler than the valley floor, so we thought that would buy us some time (to fully adapt to the crisis).” The wine industry uses a metric called growing degree days to measure how much heat is accumulating through the growing season and helps determine the speed at which grapes redeveloping. The Chos say the number of those “days” are rising, which accelerates the grapes’ ripening and pushes harvest seasons earlier. As the West gets hotter and drier, many US wine producers like the Chos see Oregon’s Willamette Valley — roughly a nine-hour drive north of the famous wine-growing Napa Valley in California — as the country’s next major wine region. “It’s like a moving train. If you’re trying to jump on a moving train, it’s really difficult,” Lois Cho said. “But in Oregon, it’s like we’re laying down the tracks, because there’s a lot of undeveloped land and untapped resources.” One of the questions for the wine industry now is whether traditional wine growers are willing to shift away from their regions and adopt new winemaking processes. ClimateAi’s Kletter said major wine producers need to consider whether there are emerging areas and opportunities to develop new vineyards and new flavors. “That’s the wine adaptation playbook,” said Kletter, who once lived in France and is a huge sparkling wine fan. “I think this is actually an exciting opportunity for businesses and potentially consumers to get access to tasty wines that they may have never experienced before.” But that’s challenging for regions like Bordeaux and Champagne in France, which are bound to their territories. By law, to be considered authentic “champagne,” the wine must come from the Champagne region. That’s why in other countries, including the US, similar drinks are called “sparkling wine.” But for the Chos, their move to Oregon has inspired experimentation. In 2022, they co-fermented their grapes with apples to create a new flavor to their sparkling wine. It’s become quite a popular product among their 2022 wines, Lois Cho said. “You can’t live in fear,” Dave Cho said. “There’s an opportunity for us to be creative.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/30/business/sec-climate-change-rule-2024/index.html,A new rule requiring companies to disclose how much they pollute is coming in 2024,12-30-2023,"                                                 After multiple delays, the Securities and Exchange Commission has finally set a deadline to decide on its climate disclosure rule by Spring 2024.                                             ","Samantha Delouya, CNN","The Securities and Exchange Commission will decide by next spring on a rule to make public companies disclose how much they generate in greenhouse gases and how climate change could hurt their businesses. The rule, which comes amid the Biden administration’s efforts to tackle climate change, has been met with backlash from business leaders and lawmakers who argue that it oversteps the SEC’s mission to safeguard investors and regulate markets. “Congress created the SEC to carry out the mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation—not to advance progressive climate policies,” a group of Republican lawmakers wrote in a letter to the agency earlier this year. Advocates say that in an age of expanding climate-related regulations, investors deserve to know the growing financial risks that some companies face from climate change ­– and laws curbing emissions – before deciding to invest. The SEC first proposed its climate disclosure rule in March 2022, but since then, the agency has delayed releasing a final version on multiple occasions. The proposal requires companies to share information on two forms of climate change risk: physical and transition risks. Physical risks refer to climate change’s impact on a company’s operations, including the hazards of increased natural disasters like wildfires or hurricanes. Transition risks refer in part to potential damage to a company’s profits due to a growing number of climate change regulations. As a result, the SEC rule would order companies to share pollution generated by their business operations, broken up into three categories: scope 1, 2 and 3. Scope 1 and 2 are direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions produced as a company conducts its business, such as waste produced by a manufacturing process or how much air conditioning is used in an office building. Scope 3 refers to emissions that a company is indirectly responsible for, meaning they are not produced by the company but are created as a result of its product. Consider an oil company: While it may have relatively low scope 1 and 2 emissions, the thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide produced by gas-powered vehicles would be factored into its Scope 3 emissions, despite the fact that the oil companies do not produce cars. Because scope 3 emissions occur outside of a company’s control, “it’s very challenging to gather all of that information,” said Rob Fisher, KPMG’s US ESG, or environmental, social and governance, leader. In a recent fireside chat hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce, SEC Chair Gary Gensler acknowledged that businesses have expressed “questions and doubts and concerns” about measuring scope 3 emissions. “But what investors have told us in the comments that they’ve sent us is that understanding the emissions of a company’s supply chain helps understand what’s called transition risk. You know, what might be the future of that business,” Gensler said. The SEC’s delay hasn’t stopped other regulators from taking pollution disclosures into their own hands. In October, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a climate disclosure bill requiring private and public companies that do business in California to disclose scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions beginning in 2026. California’s bill comes after Europe passed its own rule, called the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. It forces certain companies that do business in Europe to publish information on environmental and social matters. That rule took effect in January 2023. The combination of those two rules means that many large US companies will likely disclose climate emissions, with or without the SEC’s rule, Fisher said. “The mandatory reporting wave is already underway.” The SEC’s proposed rule has elicited strong reactions – both positive and negative ­– from lawmakers, business leaders and academics. Critics argue that the rule will have unintended consequences on the overall economy. A comment submitted to the SEC by Matthew Winden, an associate dean of the University of Wisconsin Whitewater’s College of Business, argued that the cost of measuring emissions will be greater than the SEC anticipates. Companies could pass those cost increases onto customers through higher prices or onto employees through fewer raises or wage reductions, Winden argued. Republican lawmakers have also argued that the rule is “outside the scope” of the SEC’s mission and, “if finalized in any form, will unnecessarily harm consumers, workers, and the U.S. economy,” according to a letter from three GOP members of the House. However, the rule has drawn strong support from Democratic officials. A March letter to the SEC signed by Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Jamie Raskin, urged the SEC to “fulfill its duty to investors and follow through on finalizing a strong climate disclosure rule without delay.” Gensler addressed criticisms at the fireside chat, saying that though the SEC is not a climate regulator, many companies already disclose part of their climate emissions and make promises regarding emissions and waste. Investors should have a standardized way to analyze those reports, he said. “Hundreds and hundreds of companies ­– 81% of the Russell 1000 (index) ­– are making climate disclosures, and investors are making decisions,” Gensler said. “Investors really do want some rule.” Fisher of KPMG said the rule would help rein in companies who “write their own rubric and grade their own papers” regarding environmental promises and disclosures."

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","In the hottest year on record, the fingerprints of a changing climate in a warming world were all over dozens of extreme weather events. There wouldn’t be weather without heat; heat is energy, and weather is an expression of that energy, of an atmosphere trying to balance itself. But too much heat in the system raises the limits of what is possible in weather and pushes it toward the extremes. So it’s maybe no surprise then that this year’s record heat was a “through line” in many of 2023’s most brutal weather events, Kristina Dahl, climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN. “Climate change influences our weather on Earth every day,” Dahl said. “In my mind, the burden of proof now is to show that climate change hasn’t influenced an event, because it’s just so clearly influencing everything around us.” The extreme weather events of this year are not unique – they’re a sign of what’s to come. “These types of events will continue to become more frequent and more severe if we continue to warm the planet,” Dahl said. These are just a few of 2023’s most notable examples of what a warming planet’s extreme weather can look like. Record heat wasn’t just in the air, it made it to the oceans too, which absorb most of Earth’s excess heat. “Sea surface temperatures were just so much warmer than they have been in any previous year on record,” Dahl said. Warm water acts like food for storms, and the exceptionally warm ocean water in 2023 not only created more storms in the Atlantic by neutralizing the storm-dampening effects of a strengthening El Niño, but also fueled explosive strengthening of the storms that formed across the globe. This explosive strengthening, known as rapid intensification, is becoming more likely as the atmosphere warms. A combined 12 tropical cyclones in the Atlantic and East Pacific basins rapidly intensified in 2023. Lee was the strongest Atlantic hurricane this season and maxed out as a rare Category 5 hurricane in the open ocean in September after its winds strengthened by a staggering 85 mph in 24 hours. The outburst made Lee the Atlantic’s third-fastest rapidly intensifying storm on record. Idalia, the only hurricane to make landfall in the US this year, was yet another example of the more frequent rapid intensification of storms right before landfall. The storm briefly reached Category 4 status before slamming Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 3 hurricane – the strongest storm to hit there in more than 125 years. The East Pacific’s Hurricane Otis was the most extreme example of rapid strengthening in either basin this year. Otis’s winds increased by an astounding 115 mph in the 24 hours before its devastating Category 5 landfall in Acapulco, Mexico, in October. Otis was the strongest Pacific storm to ever strike Mexico and came just two weeks after Category 4 Hurricane Lidia – also a rapid intensifier – made landfall just south of Puerto Vallarta as another one of Pacific Mexico’s strongest storms. Rapid intensification also helped Hurricane Hilary maintain enough strength to track across California as a tropical storm – the state’s first since 1997. Hilary unloaded a deluge that broke tropical rainfall records in a few states and caused extreme flooding that lingered for months in one of the driest places on Earth. Unusual wildfire behavior marked the year, both in where fires started and where they didn’t. Wildfires typically burn 7 to 8 million acres of land each year in the US, but only charred 2.6 million acres in 2023, National Interagency Fire Center statistics show. This was due in part to a soaking start to the year in the typically fiery West, which kept wildfires to a minimum after years of destruction. One season a trend does not make, and as the world warms, wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe – particularly in the West, the latest National Climate Assessment notes. Still, the season proved deadly and destructive as intense heat combined with a lack of rain to dry out soil and leave typically wet parts of the US and much of Canada vulnerable to fire. Tragedy struck Hawaii’s island of Maui in August in the form of the blazing Lahaina inferno. Wind-driven flames surged so quickly through drought-parched invasive grasses, engulfing everything in their path, that some people fleeing for their lives had no choice but to jump into the Pacific Ocean. Many could not escape, and the Lahaina Fire became the deadliest on US soil in more than 100 years. Louisiana is one of the wettest states in the US, but after a summer of endless heat, no tropical systems and little rain, the ground turned to tinder. The tremendous dryness peaked in November when 75% of the state was under exceptional drought – the most expansive such area in state history. The state endured one of its worst fire seasons in recent decades as a result, according to data provided to CNN by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry. Fires in the southern half of the state kept burning into the fall and their smoke fueled “super fog” that caused a fiery, deadly pileup near New Orleans. Fires also affected much of the US, even when they weren’t burning there. Canada’s worst wildfire season on record burned an area roughly the size of North Dakota and sent plumes of toxic smoke from its numerous massive fires into the US and all the way to Europe. The smoke blocked out the sun and sent air quality levels plummeting in June across the Northeast. Apocalyptic, orange skies engulfed New York City as the city briefly had the worst air pollution levels in the world. Heat records were shattered this summer across the Northern Hemisphere, including much of the US. In the US, a series of heat domes roasted the southern and central parts of the country. The heat index topped 130 degrees in Kansas, New Orleans hit its highest temperature ever recorded – 105 degrees – and much of Texas and Florida baked under exceptionally prolonged extreme heat. But one city was emblematic of an extreme summer with heat scientists said was “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change: Phoenix. July in Phoenix was the hottest month on record for any US city. The city’s average temperature for the month clocked in at an astonishing 102.7 degrees Fahrenheit following brutally hot days and record-warm nights. Phoenix endured an unprecedented 31 consecutive days with high temperatures at or exceeding 110 degrees. The heat took a punishing toll. At least 579 people died in 2023 of heat-related causes in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, in what was the deadliest year for heat there since the county began tracking in 2003. Days where high temperatures exceed 100 degrees are becoming more common across many major US cities as global temperatures rise, but Phoenix has seen the biggest increase of them all. The city averages 18 more days above 100 degrees each year compared to historic averages. That translates to about 111 days above 100 degrees each year. Storm Daniel brought deadly flooding to Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria in September before moving over the Mediterranean Sea and taking aim at Libya. Charged by the warm waters of the Mediterranean, Daniel became a “medicane” – a storm with similar characteristics to hurricanes and typhoons. The storm unleashed torrential rainfall across Libya and one city recorded 16 inches of rain in just 24 hours. Horrific flooding unfolded as a result, killing an estimated 4,000 people. The city of Derna was hardest hit. The flooding there burst two dams and unleashed a massive wave of water which swept away much of the city’s core. The World Weather Attribution initiative – a team of scientists that analyze the role of climate change in the aftermath of extreme weather events – found planet-warming pollution made the deadly rainfall in Libya up to 50 times more likely and 50% worse. A medicane or even a tropical system isn’t necessary to unleash devastating flooding in a warming world. As the atmosphere continues to warm it’s able to soak up more moisture like a towel and then ring it out in the form of more extreme gushes of flooding rainfall. This scenario played out multiple times in the US: A train of deadly atmospheric rivers pummeled California in January and March; catastrophic July flooding turned Vermont’s capital city of Montpelier into a raging river and turned deadly in upstate New York; and a month’s worth of rain fell in a matter of hours in New York City in September, sending feet of floodwater surging through parts of the city. CNN’s Laura Paddison and Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report."

","Eric Zerkel, CNN","This is an outdated forecast. Click here for the latest version. A major winter storm is setting up to thrash much of the eastern US this weekend with heavy rain, strong winds and the first significant snow of the season. As of Thursday morning, the highest confidence for significant snow was in portions of the interior Northeast, including central Pennsylvania and southeastern New York state, and southern and central New England. That means cities like Washington, DC, Baltimore and New York – all waiting nearly two years for an inch of snow in a calendar day – could miss out on snow and instead experience more rain, a mix of wintry precipitation, or both. But just 50 miles could separate areas that experience heavy snow from those that experience mixed precipitation or only rain, meaning small shifts in the storm’s final track and timing will make a massive difference. Regardless of the storm’s final snow totals, an impactful winter storm capable of disrupting travel is coming this weekend. It’s coming from an active Pacific storm track typical of an El Niño winter, which is sending a series of storms across the US into next week. The system responsible for the potential winter weather will first cross the southern half of the US through Friday, before swooping up the East through the weekend. In much of the South and Southeast this will mean a cool rain as the storm taps into ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Louisiana and Mississippi, still suffering from drought after a summer of extreme heat and a lack of rain, are in the bull’s-eye for what would be largely beneficial rain. Rain will begin Thursday evening in central Texas and progress with the storm’s track to the east, overrunning the Southeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic with time. This storm could cause flooding issues in the South, particularly in areas drenched earlier in the week, but its quick-moving nature should limit the potential for repeated rounds of rain. The storm will then drive north into the mid-Atlantic Saturday dumping heavy rain and freezing rain on parts of the southern Appalachians and Piedmont. The main event for snow in the Northeast will be Saturday night and Sunday as the storm tracks through the area and then off the coast. Strong winds are also possible, the exact magnitude of which in specific areas will also rely on the storm’s track and intensity. Despite lower snow chances, if even an inch were to fall in major cities along the I-95 corridor, it would end significant snowless streaks for some that have dragged on for nearing two years. New York City has waited nearly 700 days for an inch of snow in a single calendar day. Only 2.3 inches fell in Central Park during the entirety of 2023, making it the city’s least snowy calendar year on record, according to the National Weather Service. The same was true for Philadelphia and the DC area’s Dulles International Airport. It’s not as if the Northeast has gone without precipitation. In mid-December, a powerful and deadly coastal storm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands and triggered severe flooding across the region. But it’s just been too warm for precipitation to fall as snow, something that’s becoming more common as global temperatures rise because of planet-warming fossil fuel pollution. Much of the US endured a warmer-than-average December. The warmer temperatures meant snow was harder to come by. As a result, snow cover, or how much land is covered by snow, is at its lowest extent in North America since 2005, NOAA data shows."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/03/us/great-lakes-ice-cover-climate/index.html,Where is the ice? Great Lakes ice cover is nearly non-existent and reaches 50-year record low,01/03/2024,                                                 A warm start to the winter season has left the Great Lakes virtually ice-free and with their lowest ice cover to kick off a new year in at least 50 years.                                             ,"Rachel Ramirez, CNN","A warm start to the winter season has left the Great Lakes virtually ice-free and with their lowest ice cover to kick off a new year in at least 50 years. On New Year’s Day, only 0.35% of the Great Lakes were covered in ice, the lowest on record for the date, and well below the historical average of nearly 10% for this point in winter, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL). This year’s missing ice in the Great Lakes adds to a growing trend of winter ailments plaguing the US, from dwindling snowpacks in the West to an ongoing snow drought in the Northeast, all becoming more common due to warming temperatures from the climate crisis. Since record-keeping began in 1973, researchers have found the Great Lakes have been experiencing a massive decline in ice, with the peak coverage dropping by about 5% each decade. “It’s certainly very low for this time of year,” James Kessler, a physical scientist at NOAA’s GLERL, told CNN. Air temperature matters when it comes to ice cover on the Great Lakes, said Kessler. Cold air is needed to cool the water so the lakes can freeze. But with the climate rapidly heating up, records show warmer than average temperatures in the region are melting the chances for Great Lakes ice to form. “We’ve had consistently above average air temperature in the region, and we haven’t had consistently cold days,” Kessler said. “That’s really what you need. You need a consistent number of days below freezing.” Average December temperatures in the Upper Midwest states surrounding the Great Lakes soared 8 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the month. It was the warmest December on record for several cities along the Great Lakes, including Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. It was a similar story on the eastern side of the lakes as well, with Cleveland; Erie, Pennsylvania, and Buffalo, New York, all seeing one of the warmest Decembers on record. As a result, Lake Erie is currently completely ice-free. It’s an ongoing trend. Lake Erie has seen a decline in ice coverage of about 5% each decade, according to Kessler, while Lake Superior is seeing the most rapid rate of ice cover loss of about 7% every 10 years. Recent studies have shown that Lake Superior is among the fastest warming lakes in the world, thanks to planet-heating pollution. It is still early in the season, Kessler cautioned. One prolonged blast of Arctic air in the coming weeks could cause ice coverage to increase exponentially. And peak ice in the Great Lakes typically occurs in late February or early March. Kessler said that while there is year-to-year variability, the Great Lakes are trending toward a future with less ice cover. “First of all, (the data) is very noisy,” Kessler said. “But if you fit a trend line to this data, you do get a decreasing trend, so we do see that (ice cover) is going down.” Low ice cover in the Great Lakes has serious ramifications for industries and the environment. Less ice could extend shipping season. Shipments by water along the Great Lakes could grow with the ice-free waters giving way to more vessels, according to researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Superior looking into how reduced ice cover could directly affect navigation there. “The commercial shipping industry is like a multibillion-dollar industry, and so less ice cover is good for them,” Kessler said. “Often, the freighters get stuck when it’s a high year, and the US Coast Guard has to go rescue them and it’s a huge undertaking. So, from that perspective, low ice is good economically.” On the flip side, he said there’s also an economic benefit when the lakes are frozen: coastal towns benefit through recreational activities such as ice fishing competitions or ice hockey games. Ice cover also protects the shorelines of the lakes. Without it, high waves can cause severe flooding, coastline erosion and damage. A dearth of ice coverage can also lead to more severe snowstorms like the one that paralyzed Buffalo, New York, and surrounding towns in 2022, Kessler said. When very cold, windy conditions form over an unfrozen lake, it sets the stage for “lake-effect” snow. And the Great Lakes are the only place in the US where this phenomenon occurs, except occasionally at the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Kessler said that while the first couple days of January have been notable for low ice cover on the Great Lakes, daily lows are not as significant as month-long lows. “If the month of January as a whole is on average lower than past Januarys, that will be more remarkable to me,” he said. It’s impossible to know exactly how the rest of winter’s temperatures will play out around the Great Lakes. But a strong El Niño winter like this year’s typically means a greater chance for warmer than average temperatures there, meaning it could continue to be an uphill battle for the lakes’ ice. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison and Robert Shackelford, CNN","Parts of Europe are experiencing an extreme start to the new year’s weather. As some countries struggle with devastating floods, others have been plunged into extreme cold, causing chaos. Hundreds of flood warnings are in place in the UK after heavy rainfall battered swaths of the country Thursday. A party boat sank on the River Thames in London Thursday, with the boat’s owners saying the adverse weather conditions were likely to blame. The UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency told CNN that everyone was accounted for. In the east of the capital, around 70 firefighters were mobilized to deal with flooding after a canal broke its banks Thursday evening. Elsewhere in the UK, a major incident was declared in the Nottinghamshire region due to rising river levels along the River Trent, with local authorities warning river levels could come close to record highs. Thursday’s heavy rainfall came on the heels of Storm Henk, which swept southern parts of the country earlier this week, bringing strong winds and rain. The storm claimed at least one life after a man died Tuesday when a tree fell onto the car he was driving in Gloucestershire, southwest England, according to local police. The same storm also brought intense flooding to northern parts of France, leaving hundreds without power, forcing more than 370 evacuations and causing one death. The Pas-de-Calais department of northern France was under “red alert” for flooding on Thursday, according to the country’s national weather service Météo France, but was moved to orange alert, the next level down, Friday. Local authorities warned people in affected areas not to go into their basements, to avoid travel and stay away from waterways. Germany, too, has been badly affected in regions that have seen persistent flooding over the past two weeks. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited a heavily affected flood zone in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt Thursday. Around 200 soldiers will start their deployment Friday in Mansfeld-Südharz, a district in the state, where they will distribute 600,000 sandbags, according to a spokesperson for the country’s armed forces. The full extent of flood damage in Germany is not yet clear but more rain is expected Friday, according to Helge Tuschy from Germany’s Weather Service. Many of the same parts of northwestern Europe that have been flooded this month were also battered by Storm Ciarán, which brought hurricane-strength winds and claimed several lives in November. Climate change, driven primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, is causing extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, to become more frequent and more intense. As the Earth’s atmosphere warms, it is able to hold more water vapor — so when it rains, it rains much more intensely, increasing the likelihood of destructive flooding. Last year was the hottest on record globally. It’s a tale of different extremes in Europe this week, as heavy rainfall and milder temperatures in some parts contrast starkly with an intense cold snap further north. An Arctic blast has brought some record-low temperatures to parts of Scandinavia including northern Sweden and Finland along with heavy snow, causing chaos on the roads. Kvikkjokk-Årrenjarka, in northern Sweden, recorded -43.6 degrees Celsius (-46.4 Fahrenheit) Wednesday, the lowest temperature in that location since records began in 1887, said Sverker Hellström, a meteorologist at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. Snow drifts have caused severe impacts on the roads, leaving people stuck in their cars, Hellström told CNN. On Thursday, rescue services evacuated hundreds of people who had been trapped overnight in their cars due to heavy snow, according to a Reuters report. In the far northwest of Finland, temperatures in the municipality of Enontekiö dropped to -42.4 degrees Celsius (-44.3 Fahrenheit), marking country’s lowest temperature for 18 years. A woman was found dead Tuesday after going skiing in a blizzard in northern Finland with her child, whose body was found Thursday, according to Reuters. Scandinavia has been grappling with biting cold since December. Norway’s average temperature in December was 2.3 degrees below average, with Sweden and Finland seeing temperatures as low as 6 degrees below average across certain regions. The very cold weather may also have contributed to the Bothnian Bay, between Sweden and Finland, completely freezing over earlier than usual, said Mika Ratanen, a researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. It’s the earliest in winter this has happened since 2011, he told CNN. “Currently it looks like we will have a pretty good ice situation in the Baltic Sea this winter, probably the best we have had in many years,” he told CNN. Temperatures in the region are predicted to remain well below average through Friday and the weekend before returning to closer to average next week. CNN’s Nadine Schmidt, Pierre Bairin, Maya Szaniecki and Catherine Nicholls contributed reporting"

Instead, rain and wintry mix is more likely. But farther inland, this storm could produce 6 to 12 inches of snow in parts of the interior Northeast and New England, where the heaviest snow is expected.

","Helen Regan, CNN","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. China saw its hottest year on record in 2023, state media reported this week, as the world’s biggest polluter confronted a series of relentless heat waves and other extreme weather events driven by the human-caused climate crisis. Daily and monthly temperature records were repeatedly shattered as the year wore on while the country grappled with scorching heat waves, which authorities said had arrived earlier and been more widespread and extreme than in previous years. China’s exceptional warmth echoed global trends – with scientists confirming that 2023 will officially be the hottest year on record, the result of the combined effects of El Niño and climate change. The average temperature in China last year stood at 10.7 degrees Celsius – the highest since records began in 1961, according to the National Climate Center, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. It breaks the previous record of 10.5°C set in 2021. Across the country, 127 weather stations recorded their highest ever daily temperatures, state-run newspaper China Daily reported. The highest of those was 52.2°C on July 16 in Turpan’s Sanpu town, in the far western Xinjiang region. The prolonged and persistent heat affected hundreds of millions of people and put huge strain on the country’s power grid. In July, China Energy Investment Corporation, one of the world’s largest generators of coal-fired power, said the volume of electricity it produced had hit a daily record. There were also reports of farm animals, including pigs, rabbits and fish, dying from the searing temperatures and wheat fields in central China being flooded by heavy rainfall, raising concerns about food security in the world’s second largest economy. A similar story played out across the world in 2023, with a series of deadly heat waves and remarkable record temperatures hitting several continents, while unprecedented ocean heat blanketed much of the globe. Analysis from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service found 2023’s global temperature will be more than 1.4 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels — close to the 1.5-degree threshold in the Paris climate agreement, and beyond which scientists say humans and ecosystems will struggle to adapt. At the other end of the scale, China also recorded its lowest ever temperature last year on January 22, when Jintao town in Mohe, northeastern Heilongjiang province dropped to -53° C. And in December, the capital Bejing recorded its longest cold wave since records began in 1951, as sub-zero temperatures stretched heating capacity of some cities in northern China to its limit. China’s extreme weather also saw some of the heaviest rainfall in decades, with flooding bringing devastation to millions of people’s lives and causing billions of dollars in damage. A total of 55 national weather stations recorded their highest daily rainfall in 2023, according to the National Climate Center. Typhoon Doksuri slammed into southeastern Fujian province on July 28, bringing rains that soaked Hebei, a province of 75 million, and the neighboring cities of Beijing and Tianjin. Flooding in those regions killed about 30 people, displaced more than 1 million and  washed away houses, bridges and highways, according to Chinese authorities. The storm also brought the heaviest rainfall Beijing has experienced in 140 years, marking a significant test of the region’s capacity to handle extreme weather that experts warn will become more frequent with climate change. Scientists are clear that the climate crisis is making extreme weather events – such as heat waves, storms and heavy rainfall – more frequent and intense, and they will continue to become more frequent and severe as the planet heats up while humans burn more fossil fuels. China is the world’s biggest polluter, making up nearly 30% of global emissions and accounting for over half of global demand for coal, according to the International Energy Agency. The World Bank has said that without China successfully reducing its planet-heating emissions and transitioning to clean energy, the world will have little chance of achieving its climate goals. China has been accelerating production of sustainable energy and  the country is on track to double its wind and solar energy capacity and hit its 2030 clean energy targets as soon as 2025, a June report found. In November, China pledged a major ramp-up of renewable energy, alongside the United States, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The country also played a key role in climate negotiations at the COP28 summit in Dubai in December, which made an unprecedented call to transition away from fossil fuels. However, China did not sign an official agreement to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency, both by 2030, according to Carbon Brief. CNN’s Rachel Ramirez and Nectar Gan contributed reporting."

","Jacqueline Howard and Amanda Musa, CNN","Winter storms can derail our daily schedules and travel plans — but extreme cold, freezing rain, wind and snow can also affect our health. In recent years, death rates in the United States have been 8% to 12% higher during winter months, according to mortality data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overall, more than 19,000 Americans have died specifically from cold-related causes since 1979, according to death certificates. This increase is linked to “seasonal changes in behavior and the human body” and “increased exposure to respiratory diseases,” according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. On top of preparing your home and car for winter weather, there are steps you can take to keep yourself and others healthy when it’s very cold. Infants and older adults should be top of mind during a winter storm, says Dr. Tyler Barrett, executive medical director of emergency services at Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville. “Infants and older adults have a harder time maintaining their core body temperatures,” he said, because babies lose body heat more easily and older adults tend to make less body heat. Hypothermia happens when your body begins to lose heat faster than it can be produced. Make sure any children younger than 1 are sleeping in warm rooms, ideally between 68 and 72 degrees. Similarly, if you have friends or neighbors older than 65, check on them frequently to ensure that their homes are adequately heated. Barrett also notes the risk for hypothermia goes up once the temperature inside a home goes below 50 degrees for a prolonged period of time. Try to keep pets indoors during cold weather, but if they go outside, thoroughly wipe their legs and underbelly free of snow when they come in. Never use generators, gas or charcoal grills or wood stove inside your home. The fumes from these devices can cause carbon monoxide to build up, Barrett adds, and the odorless and colorless gas can kill you. “If you are running any sort of heater, always be cognizant of carbon monoxide and have a carbon monoxide detector in your house,” he said. Using the kitchen stove for heat is also not safe, the CDC warns; instead, use extra blankets, sleeping bags or coats. A well-maintained fireplace or a portable space heater may be a safer alternative. Avoid traveling on ice-covered roads if possible. If you’re stranded outdoors and have a vehicle, it’s safest to stay inside it to prevent hypothermia, the National Weather Service says. If you have to shovel snow or do other outdoor work, take your time and work slowly. Avoid walking on ice and getting wet. Travel in pairs and keep an emergency kit nearby, as well as a cell phone, when you’re participating in outdoor recreation like skiing, sledding, or going for a run. If you need to venture out during a winter storm, Barrett recommends limiting the amount of time you spend outside to prevent frostbite or hypothermia. “Dress in warm, dry layers with a special emphasis on protecting those more sensitive areas like your ears, your nose, your cheeks, your toes, your fingers,” he said. “Those are the areas that are at increased risk of developing frostbite.” Frostbite can happen in freezing temperatures when your blood vessels narrow, skin temperature drops and ice crystals form around and within your cells, causing damage. Symptoms include white or grayish-yellow skin that feels unusually firm and numbness in the affected area. If you or someone you know develops frostbite and immediate medical care is not available, the CDC recommends getting into a warm room as soon as possible and immersing the affected area in warm — not hot — water. You can also warm the affected area using body heat. Hypothermia is a more serious medical condition that requires emergency medical assistance, the CDC says. Someone with hypothermia may be shivering excessively or have skin that is bright red and cold. Other signs include confusion, memory loss, slurred speech and drowsiness. If you can’t get to a hospital right away, find a warm room or shelter and remove any wet clothing. Warm the center of the body first – chest, neck and head – with skin-to-skin contact under loose, dry layers. Warm beverages can also help increase body temperature. In extremely cold temperatures, our skin can become very dry and cracked if not moisturized properly. “You do have increased risk for developing skin infections,” Barrett said. “We all have bacteria that live on our skin, and your skin serves as a barrier, keeping that bacteria from infecting you, so if you do get dry cracked skin, you are at some slightly increased risk.” Use warm water instead of hot water during baths and showers to prevent dry skin from worsening. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends applying moisturizer immediately after you shower to trap existing moisture in your skin. An ointment or cream could be more beneficial than lotions with heavy perfumes or scents. “People who suffer from eczema may get some increased flares during wintertime,” Barrett said, adding that those with winter-related skin conditions should talk to their primary care provider for further guidance and treatment. Colder, drier air can cause complications for people with respiratory illnesses like the flu, Covid-19 and RSV, Barrett says, by irritating the airways and causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. Annual vaccinations are important, especially those for flu and Covid-19, to help prevent these complications. The flu shot has been shown to reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with flu by 40% to 60%, according to the CDC. People with lung diseases such as asthma are also at risk of complications from cold weather because of inflammation in their lungs. “If you do have asthma and you’re going to be outside, try to limit breathing in that cold air, whether that’s wearing a scarf or just limiting your time outside,” Barrett said. People with asthma should also keep a rescue inhaler on them at all times. If you cannot breathe due to extreme cold, whether from a respiratory illness or asthma, he advises going to the emergency room right away. Frosty weather can affect your heart, especially if you have cardiovascular disease, by narrowing the blood vessels. That can put stress on your heart. “Snow shoveling is one example where we see people who have heart disease, or risk factors for heart disease, exerting themselves more than they may otherwise,” Dr. Reed Caldwell, an assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and an emergency department physician, told CNN previously. A drop in temperature by 33 degrees Fahrenheit was associated with a cumulative 2% increased risk of heart attack in a 2010 study published in the BMJ. People who have a heart condition or even high blood pressure should avoid strenuous activities like shoveling or exercising too much."

A one-two punch of winter storms and the first Arctic cold outbreak of the season are poised to affect millions of Americans through next week.                                             ,"Eric Zerkel, CNN","Winter is about to kick into overdrive in the US. A one-two punch of winter storms and the first Arctic cold outbreak of the season are poised to affect millions of Americans through next week. Up first, a winter storm is on track to deal a blow of heavy snow and treacherous ice to the Northeast and mid-Atlantic this weekend. Another bigger and more potent storm will follow hot on its heels through midweek with all hazards: snow, ice, strong winds, tornadoes and flooding rainfall. “Confidence continues to increase for a highly impactful event spanning from Texas to the Great Lakes and Northeast U.S. through the middle of the week,” the Weather Prediction Center said. Here’s the latest on these developing storms: Around 40 million people are under winter storm alerts from the mid-Atlantic to the Appalachians and into southern Maine, with the storm’s worst expected Saturday to Sunday in parts of the Appalachians and the interior Northeast and New England, including just to the west of Boston. Interactive: Check to see if you’re under a winter weather alert here. Most of the major cities along the Northeast’s I-95 corridor appear set to miss out on heavy snow, but by the time the storm exits the coast, it could have wrung out as much as 12 inches of snow and as much as 0.25 inches of ice across the eastern US. On Friday, the storm spat out rain in parts of the South lighter snow to the north in parts of the Plains and Midwest. The system will continue to track through the Southeast and into the mid-Atlantic Friday into Saturday, delivering heavy rain and even the threat of a few severe storms along the Gulf Coast. Potentially damaging ice could accumulate in the southern Appalachians Friday night into Saturday morning as the storm starts to work its way into colder air. Travel in these regions could be treacherous, especially in hilly and mountainous terrain, as ice sticks to surfaces. It appears there won’t be sufficient cold air to churn out much, if any, snow in the snow-starved I-95 corridor. None was forecast in Baltimore, DC or Philadelphia Friday, so their nearly two-year long significant snowless streaks seemed like they would continue. But other cities, especially in New England, have higher snow chances. Four to 6 inches of snow are forecast in Boston. That may not live up to Boston’s notorious snowstorm past, but it could still be the city’s biggest snow from a single storm since February 25, 2022 when 8 inches fell. And if the 8 inches forecast in Hartford, Connecticut, comes to pass it would be the city’s biggest snowstorm since February 1, 2021, when 11 inches fell. Further south, areas of the Appalachians could see up to two inches of snowfall and ice accumulations as thick as 0.25 inches. Winter storm watches and warnings are in effect from western North Carolina to western Virginia beginning Friday evening and lasting through Saturday afternoon. The second storm will begin to strengthen rapidly Monday as it cuts through the Central US toward the Great Lakes, delivering snow and potential blizzard conditions to colder areas to its north along its path. Exactly where and how much snow falls will likely change with the storm’s track, which is still uncertain, but the highest chances for heavy snow are in parts of the Plains, the Great Lakes and interior Northeast. The storm will be tapping into warmer, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to its south, raising the risk of severe storms, including a few strong tornadoes and damaging winds, and flooding rainfall near the Gulf Coast. A Level 2 of 5 risk for severe storms is already in place for Monday and Tuesday, stretching from southeast Texas to the Carolinas. A Level 2 of 4 risk for flooding rainfall hugs the coasts of Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle for the storms that will cross the area Monday. As the storm moves northeast, rain and strong wind gusts will spread over much of the eastern half of the US. A Level 2 of 4 risk for flooding stretches from northeast Georgia to southern Massachusetts, and a Level 3 of 4 is in place just outside of the New York City metro in eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and southeast New York, where up to 4 inches of rain could fall. Many of these areas will have just been doused and snowed on by the first storm. Heavy rain on its own could cause flooding, but rain on top of snow amplifies the risk, as warmer rain melts the snow and injects its water quickly into watersheds. In December, a potent storm caused deadly and destructive flooding in parts of interior New England after its heavy rain melted snow. As the second storm departs by end of week, an “Arctic air outbreak” looks likely to descend on much of the US, according to the Climate Prediction Center. While it’s too soon to know exactly how cold it will get, forecasts are calling for below-average temperatures through mid-January for every area save the East Coast. And with colder air in place, there could be even more snow in the forecast in the weeks to come. CNN’s Robert Shackelford contributed to this report."

Here are five easy ways to make a positive impact in 2024.                                             ","Angela Fritz, CNN Senior Climate and Weather Editor","Improve your life in 2024 by following our Life, But Better advice for sleep, food, fitness, stress reduction and more. Start with our science-backed guidance on how to make your life greener. It sounds like such a great resolution for the new year: I’m going to live greener. But what would it actually take to live a life that’s better for our planet, when so much of the harm done is beyond our control? The climate crisis is not your fault, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do. Collectively, we can have a positive impact by making some pretty basic lifestyle changes. Here are five easy ways to get started in 2024. Rib-eye steaks and juicy cheeseburgers are huge contributors to the climate crisis. Raising beef generates a large amount of methane — a powerful planet-warming gas. It also takes a lot of energy to grow food to feed animals, which is why lamb, pork and poultry also have a significant climate impact. Eating a plant-heavy diet tops the list of Earth-friendly changes, but you don’t need to give up meat entirely to have an impact. If you’re eating meat every day, try cutting it from the menu one day a week. If you can’t stand the thought of giving up meat entirely, stick with poultry — it has the lowest climate impact. Living car-free is one of the best things you can do to help rein in the climate crisis, but doing so is not possible for most people. Instead, try to master the art of eco-driving. High speeds, hard acceleration and hard braking wastes fuel and can reduce your car’s fuel efficiency by up to 30% on the highway. Using four-wheel drive also decreases efficiency, so turn that off when you don’t really need it. Speeds around 55 miles per hour (88 kilometers per hour) are great for fuel efficiency if you’re driving a non-hybrid, gas-powered car. Anything over that, and you’re burning more gas than you need to. Homes are becoming more energy efficient, but they are also getting bigger. Combine this size with higher summer temperatures and more electronics to power, and you have a recipe for an upward trend in home electricity use. Whether you own or rent, resolve to call your electric utility and ask if you can pay for renewable energy such as solar or wind. Even if it doesn’t offer renewable energy, you’ve at least shown your utility that you’re interested in it and it’s something for which you’re willing to pay. Could you create the kind of trip you’re aiming for within driving or train distance? Driving has a lower climate impact than flying, especially as cars become more fuel efficient. Driving also costs less than flying, even when gas prices are at record highs. It also helps to avoid business- or first-class seats, because those sections carry fewer people and thus come at a climate premium. And be strategic about your travel. Consider taking one long vacation a year instead of two shorter ones if they require flying. You still get the same amount of fun in the sun but with half the number of flights. Personal action is necessary to help solve the climate crisis. But it’s not sufficient. We should minimize our climate impact wherever possible, but policymakers and industry leaders also need to make big strides as soon as possible. In the meantime, start a conversation in your city, church or workplace about how your community can do better. “We need companies to change, as well as cities and churches, schools and universities, businesses and organizations,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a distinguished climate professor at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy. “And no matter who they are, or where they are, that change begins when someone starts a conversation — about why climate change matters to them, and what they can do to make a difference.” Editor’s note: Not sure how to establish a habit?

","Rhea Mogul and Aishwayra Iyer, CNN","When blistering extreme heat gripped India’s capital this summer, Ramesh says he felt faint but had no option other than to keep on toiling under the burning sun to provide for his family. “The heat is becoming unbearable,” the 34-year-old bricklayer told CNN. “But we do not have a choice, we have to work.” Ramesh lives with his parents, three brothers, a sister-in-law, and three children, in a congested suburb in western Delhi, a city that has made headlines in recent years as mercury levels regularly climb to dangerous levels. And as temperatures topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) this June – closing schools, damaging crops and putting pressure on energy supplies – the heat was making his family sick too. Ramesh, who goes by one name, says he borrowed $35 – nearly half of his monthly salary – from relatives to buy a second-hand air conditioner for his home. “It makes a noise, sometimes it releases dust,” he said. But he cannot do without it. By 2050, India will be among the first places where temperatures will cross survivability limits, according to climate experts. And within that time frame, the demand for air conditioners (AC) in the country is also expected to rise nine-fold, outpacing all other appliances, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Ramesh’s predicament encapsulates the paradox facing the world’s most populous country of 1.4 billion: The hotter and wealthier India gets, the more Indians will use AC. And the more they use AC, the hotter the country will become. India emits nearly 2.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year based on data collected by the European Union – contributing about 7% of global emissions. The United States, by comparison, causes 13% of CO2 emissions, despite having a quarter of India’s population. This raises a question of fairness that climate scientists have often asked: should people in the developing world shoulder the cost of reducing emissions, despite being among those least responsible for rising greenhouse gases? At the COP28 climate talks in Dubai that concluded recently, India wasn’t among the list of countries that signed a pledge to cut their emissions from cooling systems. Addressing the opening session of the summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said all developing countries must be given “a fair share in the global carbon budget.” Nonetheless India, one of the world’s fastest growing economies, is on the front line of the climate crisis. And it finds itself in a tough position. How can it balance its development while ensuring environmental protection? Vast swathes of India’s population remain reliant on AC for their physical and mental wellbeing. And the country’s more tropical southern regions remain hot year-round. Over the past five decades, the country has experienced more than 700 heat wave events claiming more than 17,000 lives, according to a 2021 study of extreme weather in the Weather and Climate Extremes journal. This June alone, temperatures in some parts of the country soared to 47 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit), killing at least 44 people and sickening hundreds with heat-related illnesses. And by 2030, India may account for 34 million of a projected 80 million global job losses from heat stress, according to a World Bank report in December 2022. This puts millions of people at risk in a country where more than 50% of the workforce is employed in agriculture. And as incomes steadily rise, all while urban populations explode, AC ownership has grown at a remarkable rate. Electricity consumption in India from cooling – which includes AC and refrigerators – increased 21% between 2019 and 2022, according to the IEA. By 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners will exceed total electricity consumption in all of Africa today, it added. But this demand is also exacerbating the global climate crisis. Like refrigerators, many air conditioners today use a class of coolants called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are harmful greenhouse gases. And even more problematically, air conditioners tend to use large amounts of electricity, generated by the burning of fossil fuels. The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that – if not reined in – air conditioning-related greenhouse gas emissions could account for up to a 0.5 degrees Celsius rise in global temperatures by the end of the century. India is still grappling with widespread poverty, while spending billions to upgrade its transport and urban infrastructure, as it faces longstanding challenges to improve living standards. And limiting cooling-related emissions might be seen as a possible barrier to the country’s economic growth, experts say. During the recent COP summit, 63 countries – including the US, Kenya and Canada – signed a pledge to cut their emissions from cooling systems by 68%, along with several other targets, by 2050. India was not among the group. Despite this, Brian Dean, head of energy efficiency and cooling at Sustainable Energy for All, which helped to develop the agreement, said India has shown “important international leadership on cooling.” “While it has not joined the Global Cooling Pledge yet, important progress on sustainable cooling has been made domestically and international partners hope that India considers joining in the future,” he said. Under the United Nations’ 2016 Kigali Amendment, many countries including India are phasing out HFCs and replacing them with more climate friendly options, such as hydrofluoroolefins, or HFOs. Similar moves have worked in the past. The Kigali Amendment is an update to the Montreal Protocol that helped to phase out ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, in the 1980s. Still, countries that lack access to adequate cooling need help to meet the cost of energy improvement, according to Radhika Khosla, associate professor at Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and Environment. “Cooling is now on the global agenda,” she said. “But the hard work must begin to ensure everyone can stay cool without further heating the planet.” Planting trees to absorb sunlight, water bodies, courtyards that promote cooling and clever ventilation are among the more sustainable “passive cooling strategies” suggested by Khosla. Installing ceiling fans in buildings can reduce household energy consumption for cooling by more than 20%, she added. “If successful, passive cooling measures could curb the demand for cooling by 24% by 2050, saving $3 trillion and negating greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide,” she said. India has also promised to reduce its power demand for cooling purposes by 20-25% by 2038 under its own cooling action plan announced in 2019, while still focusing on developing and implementing cost-effective solutions that align with its economic goals. Dean calls it “one of the first comprehensive national Cooling Action Plans to be developed globally.” It was, he said, “an important moment for emphasizing the need to proactively and urgently address cooling demand growth, including in agriculture where sustainable cold chains can prevent food loss and improve nutritional outcomes.” Renewable energy is also growing faster in India than in any other major economy, and data shows it’s on track to meet its emission reduction targets, according to Leena Nandan, India’s secretary for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. India remains proactive in finding climate solutions, despite not being a major contributor to the crisis, she told reporters during the COP28 summit. “We have gone on to scale up our climate ambitions,” she said. But India’s AC boom has been visible in almost every urban corner of the country. Hundreds of construction sites are scattered throughout the capital, where laborers toil to build gleaming high-rise towers to house New Delhi’s burgeoning middle class. Penta Anil Kumar, a businessman who lives in Lajpat Nagar, a bustling south Delhi neighborhood, said he is aware of the harmful emissions released from his air conditioner, and deliberately bought an energy efficient model able to meet his cooling needs. “While I know the use of air conditioners is contributing to higher temperatures, I also know I cannot do much else,” he said. But Kumar is among those more fortunate who can afford a more expensive AC model. Ghasiram, a 65-year-old laborer from Delhi’s Rohini neighborhood, paid a contractor $36 to secure a second-hand AC unit for his family. But this is more than what he earns in a month. Ghasiram, who goes by one name, said he didn’t know emissions from his AC were partly fueling rising temperatures. But he is suffering from the consequences. “The heat has gotten worse over the years,” he said. “When I need to step out to work in the heat, I feel nervous. I prefer to not go out.”"

","Eric Zerkel, CNN","A winter storm is plowing through the mid-Atlantic and Northeast Saturday, and there’s another stronger one nipping at its heels that will affect a much wider area of the US. The first storm will unleash up to a foot of snow through Sunday that could cause travel disruptions for the millions currently under winter storm alerts. Freezing rain fell throughout early Saturday in the interior mid-Atlantic, including parts of Virginia and North Carolina where enough ice accumulated to make driving dangerous. Heavy snow reached the interior Northeast in the late morning Saturday. A couple of inches of snow were already reported in central Pennsylvania by Saturday afternoon, ending the 346 day-long wait in the area for widespread significant snow. Roads conditions deteriorated across the area as the snow started to accumulate and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation maps showed widespread slow downs on roads. Pennsylvania transportation crews started prepping roads for these conditions on Friday with the goal to “keep roads passable, not completely free of ice and snow,” a Pennsylvania DOT statement said. Parts of Pennsylvania will see some of the storm’s worst, along with parts of the Appalachians and the interior Northeast and New England, including just to the west of Boston. Heavy snow will spread northeast throughout Saturday, with the heaviest finally reaching New England by the late afternoon and continuing overnight into Sunday. Visibility and road conditions will start to go downhill quickly as snow moves into new areas, with 1 to 2 inch per hour snowfall rates likely. Governors and other officials in New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island touted their preparations for the storm Saturday before the worst arrived and encouraged people not to venture out. “We are ready for the storm. We ask you to do the same,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said at a news conference Saturday. “With advance notice, stay alert and stay home if you can.” Major disruptions were less likely in the major cities of Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York and Washington, DC, in the snow-starved I-95 corridor. The storm’s track and insufficient cold air combined to limit snow chances to little, if any. Rain, or even a mix of wintry precipitation, is more likely. But other cities, especially in New England, have higher snow chances. Several inches of snow were forecast in Boston. That may not live up to Boston’s notorious snowstorm past, but it could still be the city’s biggest snow from a single storm since February 25, 2022, when 8 inches fell. And if forecasts in Hartford, Connecticut, come to pass, the storm would be the city’s biggest snowstorm since February 1, 2021, when 11 inches fell. Crews in Boston also prepped streets, which were expected to remain open. They put drivers and and up to 800 pieces of equipment on standby should the need arise. “Our goal will just be to keep on top of the storm as it is happening to keep streets clear and passable,” Boston Chief of Streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge said at a Friday news conference. “In general though, when there is weather like this, we ask that people use caution if they are going out that they drive carefully.” Another bigger and more potent storm will follow the first storm’s through midweek with all hazards: snow, ice, strong winds, tornadoes and flooding rainfall. It will begin to strengthen rapidly Monday as it cuts through the Central US toward the Great Lakes, delivering snow and potential blizzard conditions to colder areas to its north along its path. Exactly where and how much snow falls will likely change with the storm’s track, which is still uncertain, but the highest chances for heavy snow are in parts of the Plains, the Great Lakes, Midwest and interior Northeast. Chicago and Milwaukee could both be in for snow. The storm will be tapping into warmer, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to its south, raising the risk of severe storms, including a few strong tornadoes and damaging winds, and flooding rainfall near the Gulf Coast. The severe storm risk will be greatest Monday and Tuesday in southern portions of the Southeast, including Florida. As the storm moves northeast, rain and strong wind gusts of 40 mph or greater will spread over much of the eastern half of the US. Flooding and power outages will be serious concerns. Winds could be particularly strong along the East Coast. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service in Boston said Saturday morning that Hurricane Force Wind Watches – warning of winds of 74 mph or greater – may be needed for the area if confidence continues to grow in the chance for such winds. Widespread heavy rain will fall on top of areas just doused and snowed on by the first storm. Heavy rain on its own could cause flooding, but rain on top of snow amplifies the risk, as warmer rain melts the snow and injects its water quickly into watersheds. An area between Philadelphia and New York City, including Trenton, New Jersey, was placed under a Level 3 of 4 risk for flooding on Friday, well in advance of its expected impact on Tuesday by the Weather Prediction Center. This signals rare confidence in a high impact flood event for the area. This same, destructive story played out in December, when a potent storm caused deadly flooding in parts of interior New England after its heavy rain melted snow. CNN’s Amy Simonson, Sarah Dewberry, Maria Sole Campinoti, Samantha Beech contributed to this report."

","Allison Chinchar, CNN","Nearly 70 million people across the Gulf Coast and Southeast are at risk for severe weather, including tornadoes, damaging wind and flooding rain on Monday and Tuesday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Days after the season’s first big winter storm, another storm is on the move and is expected to bring heavy snow, blizzard conditions, strong winds, potential tornadoes and serious flooding as it carves a path from the Southwest to the Northeast through midweek. There is now a Level 3 of 5 enhanced risk Monday for cities like New Orleans, Louisiana, Gulfport, Mississippi and Mobile, Alabama, as storms sweep across the area in the afternoon and overnight. Tornadoes are especially likely in this area. Additionally, there is also a Level 3 of 4 moderate risk of excessive rainfall with 3 to 5 inches expected, which could lead to flooding. On Tuesday, the same system moves further east, where there is an enhanced risk of severe weather for cities like Tallahassee, Florida, Albany, Georgia, and Panama City, Florida in the early morning and continuing into the afternoon. The coming disruptive weather arrives just a day after a winter storm dumped more than a foot of snow on the Northeast and brought rain, snow, ice and even a tornado as it tracked from the Gulf Coast to Maine. The latest system is expected to rapidly strengthen into an exceptionally powerful January storm and cause widespread, significant effects east of the Rockies beginning Monday. Although it will be a fast-moving system, traversing over 1,800 miles in 72 hours, it will still produce notable snowfall across more than a half a dozen states. Widespread snowfall accumulations of at least 6 inches are expected from northern New Mexico to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Heavy snow and strong winds will create blizzard conditions Sunday as the storm exits Arizona and heads to the Texas and Oklahoma panhandle region Sunday night. Blizzard warnings were already hoisted in Colorado and New Mexico early Sunday morning. Poor visibility and difficult-to-near-impossible driving conditions will set in for the Southwest on Sunday, the central and southern Plains on Monday and the Midwest on Tuesday. Strong winds will also bring wind chill values below zero degrees for some locations in the Plains. Snow and cold temperatures will not be the only concerns as the storm surges northeast, intensifies and expands its reach to much of the eastern half of the US into the middle of the week. Flooding, damaging winds and even tornadoes will also be concerns. Along the Gulf Coast, warm, moist air will fuel the threat for severe storms, including a few strong tornadoes and damaging winds. More than 15 million people are under a severe storm threat Monday from Texas to Florida. Over 35 million people are under the same threat level Tuesday from the Panhandle of Florida to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. An equally serious concern is the potential for significant flooding from the storm’s strong winds blowing water onshore and its potent rainmaking storms. “Widespread and potentially significant river and flash flooding are likely from the central Gulf Coast through much of the Eastern U.S. early this week,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “Powerful onshore winds will lead to widespread coastal flooding along the eastern Gulf Coast and much of the East Coast.” Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected from the Gulf Coast to New England with isolated locations exceeding 4 inches. There’s serious concern for flooding in the Northeast with this next wave of rain coming right after the first snowstorm dropped more than half a foot of snow in multiple Northeast states. Heavy rain will accelerate snowmelt and increase the amount of water running off into waterways, raising the ceiling on the flood potential in these areas. As a result, there is a Level 3 out of 4 risk for flooding in portions of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania on Tuesday. A Level 2 of 4 threat spans nearly the entire path of the first storm – from Georgia through Massachusetts. A Level 3 of 4 risk for flooding is also in place along the western coast of Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle for the flood potential from the initial round of rain on Monday. The rainfall is both a gift and a concern for Louisiana and Mississippi – both still grappling with serious droughts, though drought has already improved substantially since November from a recent overabundance of rain. Locations along the Gulf Coast from New Orleans to Tallahassee, Florida, are more than 5 inches  above normal for rainfall since December 1, so it won’t take much for the saturated ground to flood. Wind is another concern with saturated ground. It makes trees more vulnerable to toppling over onto power lines or homes. And the winds will be strong enough to cause such damage. “Gusty winds on the warm side of the storm may exceed 50 MPH and cause damage over the Appalachians to the East Coast,” the Weather Prediction Center said. The center also warned people to “prepare for power outages” from the potentially damaging winds. The strongest winds will be closer to the coast. High wind watches will likely be issued in the next 24 hours, but the National Weather Service office in Boston noted they might need to issue hurricane-force wind watches – warning of winds akin to a Category 1 hurricane – for coastal areas if the storm’s worst forecast fears came to pass. Winds will also trigger high surf of 8 to 11 feet and significant beach erosion is possible. Dangerous rip currents are also likely and will continue through at least the middle of the week. The storm system looks to wrap up near the end of the week, but another storm looks like it could follow a similar path and affect some of the same areas later in the week and into the weekend. CNN meteorologist Gene Norman contributed to this report."

","Angela Dewan, Krystina Shveda and Lou Robinson, CNN","Global warming in 2023 hit 1.48 degrees Celsius, data published Tuesday shows, as the hottest year on record propelled the world just hundredths of a degree away from a critical climate threshold. Analyses last year had already confirmed 2023 to be the warmest on record, but Tuesday’s data shows an alarming leap in heating from 2016, previously the hottest year. In 2023, the average global temperature was 14.98 degrees Celsius — 0.17 degrees above the previous record — while warming in the world’s oceans also hit a new high. Scientists repeatedly expressed shock in 2023 as successive heat records fell, and warned the world is moving dangerously close to the 1.5-degree limit that nearly 200 countries sought to avoid in the Paris Agreement in 2015. The data and an analysis, published by Copernicus — the EU’s climate and weather monitoring agency — says that global warming may worsen at the start of this year, projecting that a 12-month period ending in January or February will likely breach 1.5 degrees. But scientists are far more concerned about a long-term state of warming of 1.5 degrees and above — rather than individual years. Above that threshold, many of the Earth’s ecosystems will struggle to adapt and summertime heat will approach the limits of human survivability in some places. The unprecedented heat in 2023 was caused primarily by climate change, Copernicus said, but was exacerbated by El Niño, a natural climate variability that increases Pacific Ocean heat and typically boosts the world’s temperatures. While some scientists have said the 1.48 degrees of warming is in line with last year’s heat records, others are still surprised at how much hotter 2023 was over previous years. “It is a shock that this year has unarguably smashed the global temperature record,” said Bill Collins, professor of climate processes at the University of Reading in the UK. “There is no opportunity here to quibble about hundredths of a degree, exceeding the previous record by 0.17 degrees should be an alarm call to everyone.” Every day in 2023, the global average temperature was at least 1 degree hotter than the corresponding day in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period, Copernicus said. That’s the first time on record that’s happened. Global temperatures have been steadily increasing since the 1970s, until 1 degree of global warming was breached for the first time in 2015, according to historical temperature data from Copernicus. It took only eight years to leap another half a degree above pre-industrial levels. Even compared to the past three decades, when temperatures have been warmer, 2023 stands out. The year was 0.6 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1991-2020 average. Several months ago, there was a projection among the scientific community that warming would hit around 1.3 degrees in 2023, said Liz Bentley, chief executive of the UK’s Royal Meteorological Society. That prediction has been “annihilated,” she said, as temperature records fell on the regional, national and international levels around the world, including daily and monthly records. Other thresholds are being crossed too — two days in November were, for the first time, more than 2 degrees warmer. Every month in 2023 between June and December was the hottest such month on record. July and August were the first and second-warmest on record, overall, Copernicus said. Given the tumbling records, Bentley said, it wasn’t so much the 1.48-degree temperature rise that was surprising but the pace of climate change in recent years. “If you look at climate projections, when we expect to see temperature changes of close to 1.5 degrees Celsius, indeed it has come sooner than many would have expected,” Bentley told CNN. “We’ve definitely seen an acceleration towards that, rather than it being a kind of linear progression. It feels like it’s rising much more exponentially.” Annual average air temperatures were either the hottest, or nearly the hottest, on record over all ocean basins and all continents, except Australia, the Copernicus data shows. That temperature rise covers nearly the entire world map. The year of record heat, which saw deadly extreme weather events, including wildfires in Canada, Hawaii and southern Europe, “has given us a taste of the climate extremes that occur near the Paris targets,” said Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London. “It should shake the complacency displayed in the actions by most governments around the world,” he said. The world’s oceans also experienced unprecedented heat and remained unusually warm in 2023. Sea surface temperatures were 0.44 degrees above the 1991–2020 average, the highest on record and a leap from the 0.26-degree rise seen in 2016, the second-warmest year. The main long-term factor behind the oceans’ alarming heat is fossil fuel pollution, but El Niño — which began in July — also contributed. Higher sea surface temperatures can lead to more powerful hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones. At the tail end of the hottest year on record, nearly 200 countries represented at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai last month agreed for the first time to contribute to a global transition away from fossil fuels, the main cause of the climate crisis. The deal was widely welcomed, but critics say it included loopholes that would allow major fossil fuel producing nations to take little action. “The extremes we have observed over the last few months provide a dramatic testimony of how far we now are from the climate in which our civilization developed,” said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus’ Climate Change Service. “This has profound consequences for the Paris Agreement and all human endeavors. If we want to successfully manage our climate risk portfolio, we need to urgently decarbonize our economy whilst using climate data and knowledge to prepare for the future.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/10/climate/snow-loss-northern-hemisphere-study-climate/index.html,Snow is disappearing as the planet warms. A new study shows who’s losing the most,01/10/2024,                                                 New analysis found the climate crisis has caused significant drops to seasonal snow in the world’s north since the 1980s.                                             ,"Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Vast swaths of the US have been hit with powerful storms, including blizzards that have blanketed parts of the Midwest and Northeast in snow. But something’s amiss: many states accustomed to white winters are now getting more rain than snow. A new study published on Wednesday shows that the human-caused climate crisis has reduced snowpack in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere in the last 40 years, threatening crucial water resources for millions of people. It might seem logical that a warmer world would be less hospitable to snow, but the relationship between snow and climate change is complex, and scientists have for many years struggled to make a clear connection between the two. Part of the problem has been that snowfall is notoriously difficult to measure accurately, and scientific data from ground observations, satellites, and climate models have given contradictory signals on the role of climate change in declining snowpacks. Some areas have even experienced more snow in our warmer world. But Wednesday’s study, published by researchers at Dartmouth College in the journal Nature, offers the big picture — climate change has caused significant drops in snow in the world’s north since the 1980s. Areas in the US Southwest and Northeast, as well as in Central and Eastern Europe, have experienced the steepest global warming-related declines of between 10% and 20% per decade. “It’s very clear that climate change has been having negative impacts on snow and water,” said Alexander Gottlieb, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at Dartmouth College. “And every additional degree of warming is going to take away a bigger and bigger chunk of your snow water resources.” The researchers found that snowpack loss accelerates when average winter temperatures at a location rise above minus 8 degrees Celsius (around 17 degrees Fahrenheit), a point they refer to as a “snow-loss cliff.” Past that, snow loss accelerates with even modest rises in temperature. That’s a huge problem for communities that depend on snow for water. Many of the world’s water supplies are already threatened by climate change through drought and heat waves that are becoming more frequent and intense. As the planet continues to warm, the study found that many highly populated areas that rely on snow are going to see increased losses in water availability over the next few decades. “When you have a regime shifting to one that’s no longer snow-dominated in the winter, but instead is rain-dominated, you have a situation where you can have reservoirs at half full, or less,” Justin Mankin, senior author of the study and associate professor of geography in Dartmouth, told CNN. “Then the question becomes ‘well, are we going to have a rainy spring?’” to compensate for water withdrawals from places downstream. They also looked at river basins to measure how much snow water resource had dropped. The study found a declining trend in snowpack across 82 out of 169 major Northern Hemisphere river basins, including the Colorado River in the US and the Danube River in Europe, with 31 of those confidently showing the fingerprints of human-caused climate change. “Most of the world’s people live in river basins that are at this precipice of falling off an accelerating snow-loss cliff, whereby every additional degree of warming means greater and greater snowpack loss,” Mankin said. To reach their conclusions, the researchers specifically analyzed snowpack declines in March between 1981 and 2020, because it provides a “convenient summary of all winter weather,” Mankin said. He noted that the amount of snow on the ground in March indicates what the winter conditions were like that season before spring melts the reservoir that trickles downstream to supply water for households and agriculture. “March snowpack is emblematic of everything that happened over the winter, and we do test the sensitivity of that measure,” Mankin said. Back-to-back years of less snowpack in the western US have already given a preview of what future winters and springs could look like in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere, from unprecedented water shortages to worsening wildfires, said Mankin. Snow also helps prevent wildfires or can reduce their intensity. Unlike rain, which can run off quickly, snow melts slowly over time and can provide a slow and sustained release of water into the soil, making it less likely to ignite and providing less fuel for fires to spread. Less snowpack also carries a significant toll for places that rely on winter recreational activities, such as skiing and snowboarding, as key economic drivers. Many ski resorts in the Northern Hemisphere are facing such challenges already, with many now relying on snow cannons to ensure there’s enough snow to keep businesses operational. Some places are approaching temperature thresholds that will make even machine-made snow unviable. Mona Hemmati, postdoctoral research scientist at the Columbia Climate School, who was not involved with the study, said the research provided “compelling evidence” of how human-caused climate change is influencing snow patterns. “What makes this study groundbreaking is its approach to isolating the effects of anthropogenic climate change from natural climate variability,” Hemmati told CNN. “This study serves as a crucial reminder of the escalating impacts of climate change and the imperative for immediate and concerted action to address this global challenge.”"

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","Planet-warming pollution in the US decreased nearly 2% in 2023 even as the economy grew, according to new data from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group. The falling emissions, driven largely by retirements of dirty, coal-fired power plants, put US climate pollution at its lowest level since 1991, Rhodium analyst Ben King told CNN. But the numbers also show the nation is nowhere near hitting the aggressive climate targets laid out by President Joe Biden at the start of his first term. In order to achieve Biden’s goal of cutting emissions in half by the end of the decade, King said the current reductions would have to triple to around 7% reductions per year. That would take much more wind, solar, nuclear and other zero-emissions energy providing electricity to the grid, more vehicles on the road powered by electricity or zero-emission fuels, and heavy industry like steel, cement and chemical manufacturers slashing their emissions. “It’s good to see emissions moving in this direction, but more work is needed to keep the US on track for its Paris goals,” King said. It remains to be seen whether the US can keep its promise to steeply cut its emissions, and the US will have to update its targets next year – a step that will be shaped by the outcome of the 2024 election. The data shows continued cutbacks on coal energy have a big impact on US climate pollution. Unlike in China, no new coal plants are being built in the US, and many utilities are retiring aging and costly power plants that were built in the 1970s and 1980s. “We do see coal … is back to where it was in the Nixon administration,” King said. “We’ve resumed a structural decline in coal in the power sector which has been going on in the (natural gas) fracking revolution.” The Rhodium data underscores cutting emissions and growing the economy can be done at the same time, King noted, especially given the massive amount of tax subsidies for clean energy in the Inflation Reduction Act. Rhodium’s numbers weren’t able to take much of the IRA’s impacts on the EV and clean energy industries into account, as 2023 was a year that the Biden administration spent issuing guidance around the law. “Increasing deployment of these clean energy technologies, the IRA helps make the economic case for that,” King said. Other barriers remain, such as fast energy permitting to get more clean energy on the grid, and getting more EV charging stations built, but “if you can make it so darn cheap,” the ingredients for deep decarbonization are there, King said."

A round of snow will target the high elevations of Arizona and New Mexico through Thursday. The storm will then morph into a much larger beast – its strengthening aided by a big push of atmospheric energy – as it exits the Plains by Thursday evening and sets the stage for a highly impactful event in the central and eastern US. Here’s a breakdown of what to expect. The storm will strengthen Thursday night and begin to dump snow, which may be heavy at times, from parts of Kansas and Nebraska into the Midwest. This snow will be accompanied once again by gusty winds which may lead to whiteout conditions. Travel Thursday night may become treacherous. Simultaneously, very cold air will plunge south out of Canada and send temperatures plummeting across much of the north-central US. A severe thunderstorm threat will once again target a significant portion of the South. Parts of Arkansas, eastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana, including Shreveport, have an enhanced risk of severe storms, or a Level 3 of 5, on Thursday night, according to the Storm Prediction Center. The main threats in those areas are strong tornadoes, large to very large hail and damaging wind gusts. A slight risk for severe storms, or Level 2 of 5, is in place Thursday night for a wider area, from eastern Texas to western Mississippi. The main threats there are tornadoes, strong gusts and large hail. As the storm moves east on Friday and continues to become stronger, snow will envelop more of the Midwest. The highest snow accumulations from this storm are expected to remain confined to portions of Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois. Close to a foot of snow may fall in some inland portions of each state, away from the relative warmth of the Great Lakes. Some uncertainty remains in exactly how much snow this storm delivers to Chicago. Its proximity to Lake Michigan could mean air temperatures are unable to drop low enough for a significant amount of snow. But, if the city gets trapped under a particularly heavy band of snow, much more could manage to stick and lead to significant travel issues. Meanwhile, brutally cold air will continue to expand across more of the central and northern US. Air temperatures in Omaha, Nebraska, are unlikely to climb out of the single digits on Friday while parts of North Dakota will be lucky if high temperatures reach zero degrees. On the southern, warm side of the storm, another significant severe thunderstorm event will target a large section of the Southeast and portions of the mid-Atlantic. The greatest risk of damaging storms encompasses areas from Alabama to North Carolina. A Level 3 out of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place for this area Friday and damaging wind gusts and a few strong tornadoes are possible. Rain will overspread more of the mid-Atlantic and reach parts of the Northeast Friday night. Flooding concerns will increase from parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey into Southern New England as the rain arrives. Rainfall totals are expected to be about the same or slightly lower than the last storm: 1 to 2 inches are likely, but isolated locations could see closer to 3 inches. With the ground soaked and rivers still swollen from the last storm, flooding could happen much more easily. The storm will reach the Northeast by the earliest hours of Saturday morning, with snow and potentially some sleet mixed in across the interior Northeast, especially in northern New England. Along with the winter precipitation, strong winds will once again slam the Northeast and additional power outages are likely. The last storm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people in the East, and many remain without power on Wednesday. Snow will continue across the Great Lakes as well, with some lake-effect snow likely to develop in the wake of the storm late Saturday. The most significant impacts from the storm will generally exit the Southeast and mid-Atlantic by Saturday morning, but some breezy conditions will remain in the storm’s wake. In the central US, brutal cold will only get worse throughout the weekend and into next week. Temperatures will reach dangerous levels, especially across the north-central US. CNN’s Robert Shackelford contributed to this report."

It’s a sluggish start to what should be the region’s wet season and is raising concerns about the future of the water supplies that depend on it. The weather through early January was “great for outdoor activities like beach volleyball but not great for water supply,” Bill Hasencamp, manager of Colorado River Resources for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides water to Los Angeles, told CNN. Although meteorologists and Western water experts caution it’s still early in the winter and a lot can change between now and April, the warm, dry weather is notable for how far-reaching it has been. “What is interesting to me is just how widespread the below average conditions are,” Brad Udall, a senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University, said in an email. Usually at this point, some areas are below-average snowpack while others are above-average, Udall told CNN. “This year, that is not the case. The whole West, so far, is quite dry.” This year’s weather and precipitation pattern so far stands in stark contrast to last winter – a blockbuster year for snow that filled reservoirs across the West. If 2023 was a “gamechanger” for the West’s water supplies, 2024 could be shaping up to be an anxiety-inducing pivot back to drought. Several atmospheric rivers last winter dumped snow across the West by the start of January. But that stormy pattern hasn’t shown up yet this year, said Paul Miller, a hydrologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Colorado Basin River Forecast Center. “We just had a historic number of those last year and this year it’s been zero,” Miller told CNN. “This can change; we’ve gotten off to drier starts in the past and recovered.” Snowpack conditions as of early January were 40% to 70% below normal in the upper Colorado River basin, officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday, and there’s “little to no snow” in the lower basin. But they also noted January temperatures are dipping, and more precipitation is starting to fall in the region, and a midweek storm slammed the Northwest and Northern California with heavy snow and rain. Still, NOAA experts noted Wednesday that these storms were “unlikely to completely erase existing deficits.” There was some hope this year that El Nino – a Pacific Ocean phenomenon that influences weather around the world – would bring more storms to the West. But NOAA scientists cautioned on Monday that its impact is not as far-reaching; it could bring wetter conditions to the Southwest but drier-than-normal weather to southern Wyoming and northern Colorado. And Northern California is unlikely to be impacted by a typical El Nino, NOAA scientists said. The region is no stranger to variability of a record wet winter followed by several drier ones, Miller said. But human-caused climate change is making drought longer and more persistent, making each wet year more important, he added. “It’s very difficult to pinpoint single years or events to climate change,” Miller said. “But this current pattern we’re in over the last 20 to 30 years is very symptomatic of climate change impacts.” In California, the first survey of the year revealed a miniscule snowpack, with about 7.5 inches of snow equivalent to about 3 inches of melted water. It’s a “pretty modest” showing, said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources, especially considering last year at this time California was measuring 55.5 inches of snow. The good news for California, however, is its reservoirs are full for the first time in years – meaning there is ample water to help get through the year. “Our reservoirs are in much better condition because last year was so incredibly wet,” Nemeth said. If the state does get a big storm, she said, some dams are already so full they may activate their flood spillways much earlier in the year than is typical. The state would also try to direct extra water that can’t fit in the reservoir into groundwater recharge ponds – attempting to raise depleted groundwater levels, Nemeth said. “It’s good news for water supply that our reservoir conditions are orders of magnitude much healthier than they were a year ago,” Nemeth said. Even though California’s dams are full, the nation’s largest reservoirs still have a long way to go. Water levels in lakes Mead and Powell – fed by the Colorado River – are far below average. “Even though conditions definitely improved there, they’re such massive reservoirs that they’re at critically low levels,” Miller said. While last winter bolstered water supplies across the West after several perilously dry years, several experts said it’s unlikely a historic water year of that magnitude will happen twice in a row. “You tend to get wet years followed by several dry years,” Hasencamp said. “We shouldn’t expect every year to be dry, but we should expect more dry years than wet years.”"

And the cold is expected to test Texas’s notoriously vulnerable-to-extreme-temperatures power grid for the first time this winter. Temperatures could drop as low as 20 to 30 degrees below zero in the northern Plains both Friday and Saturday night and combine with gusty winds to make for frigid wind chills as low as 50 degrees below zero. More than 25 million people from Washington to Illinois are under wind chill alerts where frostbite could occur in as little as 10 minutes on exposed skin. The cold will spread south and east across the country and eventually envelop Texas and other parts of the South by the weekend, lasting into the middle of next week. Afternoon high temperatures on Friday will likely fail to reach zero degrees across much of Montana and North Dakota. High temperatures in the single digits and 10s will then spread east into parts of the central Plains and Midwest. By the weekend, the coldest air will stretch from Denver to Indianapolis, with temperatures at least 30 degrees below normal. Denver’s high temperature is forecast to drop from 33 degrees on Friday to 10 degrees on Saturday, dipping to 7 degrees Sunday. The wind chill Sunday morning in Denver is expected to be as low as minus 20 degrees. The plummeting temperatures will increase power demand on Texas’s power grid enough that the state’s independent grid operator, ERCOT, issued a weather watch for Monday, warning of the impending surge in demand and a potential dip in reserves. On Thursday, ERCOT said there was expected to be enough power to avoid outages. More than 200 people died – most of them from hypothermia – during a historic bout of cold and an ice storm in February 2021 during which ERCOT implemented rolling power outages to prevent the power grid’s collapse. While it will be cold in Texas, it’s not expected to be as severe, widespread or prolonged as in 2021. This cold air is not expected to threaten any significant records, but will come as quite a shock after a warm start to winter. Chicago hasn’t had a high temperature below freezing since November 28, Brett Borchardt, meteorologist for the National Weather Service office in Chicago told CNN. Wind chills on Monday in Chicago will be “near or below minus 30 degrees,” Borchardt said, “comparable to the 2017-2018 cold snap.” Iowa has held caucuses every four years since 1972 in either January or February, putting them at risk for cold, but nothing like what’s forecast next week. Monday’s caucuses look like they will end up being the coldest ever. Monday is forecast to be the state’s coldest January day in five years, with wind chills as low as minus 40 degrees. Iowans will wake up to temperatures more than 15 degrees below zero on Monday morning. Most of the state will not climb above zero degrees Monday afternoon, aside from far southeastern portions which may reach a degree or two above zero. The temperature in Des Moines may fail to reach zero degrees for the first time since February 2021. The forecast average temperature on Monday in Des Moines is minus 9.5 degrees, nearly 20 degrees colder than the previous coldest caucus night on January 19, 2004. Add winds, and the cold will be a life-threatening minus 20 degrees to minus 40 degrees. The likely record caucus cold spans several other Iowa cities, including Sioux City, Cedar Rapids and Davenport. CNN Meteorologists Monica Garrett and Brandon Miller and CNN’s Joe Sutton contributed to this story."

The service warned of “intense bursts of heavy snow and gusty winds leading to blowing snow and rapidly falling visibility” and said “travel will become difficult to potentially dangerous within minutes.” The New York City Emergency Management Department issued a Weather Alert for Sunday, warning of an arctic cold front expected to sweep through the region in the early afternoon. The snow squall threat had ended for New York City by late Sunday afternoon, according to emergency management, though a few flurries remained possible Sunday night with light snow expected into Tuesday, the agency said on X. States of emergency were declared in both Arkansas and Louisiana ahead of the system to prepare for its arrival. Ice is one of the biggest concerns. A strip of sleet and freezing rain is expected from San Angelo, Texas, to Huntsville, Alabama. Hazardous ice could build up on roadways, trees and power lines. And because of the cold, the slick wintry precipitation won’t melt on untreated surfaces for the Monday morning commute in places like Dallas and Shreveport, Louisiana, making travel more dangerous. Dallas is expected to see a combination of freezing rain, sleet and snow from 3 p.m. Sunday through 9 a.m. Monday. The timing will skew a few hours later in points to the east. The storm will lay down a coating of snow between 2 and 6 inches from Oklahoma to Virginia, just north of where the heaviest ice will fall. Memphis, which has had no measurable snow so far this year, is forecast to see between 3 and 7 inches. The threat here begins late Sunday and continues through Monday overnight. Snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches are also expected from Oklahoma City through Tulsa. Nearly the entire state of Arkansas is expected to see at least 3 inches, with some locations picking up as much as 6 inches total. Snowfall accumulations of 3 to 5 inches are expected for Nashville and Knoxville, Tennessee. The storm will clear the South by late Tuesday and could then track into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, increasing snow chances there by Wednesday. CNN Meteorologist Sara Tonks contributed to this story."

And even as the US struggles to cope with intense bursts of heavy snow now, over the long term, the human-caused climate crisis has led to an alarming trend of disappearing snow in the Northern Hemisphere. Some scientists say that climate change may even be playing a role in these icy blasts, as warming in the Arctic increases the likelihood that frigid, polar air can sweep southwards. Our weather is heavily influenced by the jet stream, a wavy river of fast-moving air high in the atmosphere. When the jet stream swings south, it can push cold Arctic air into North America, Europe and Asia. When it retreats north, warm air will also push further north.  A big high-pressure swing over Europe last January led to record warm winter temperatures. There’s also another factor to consider: the polar vortex, a belt of strong winds which sits extremely high in the stratosphere – above the level of the jet stream – around the North Pole. The polar vortex is like a spinning top. In its normal state it rotates very fast, keeping blisteringly cold air locked in the Arctic region. But it can get disrupted and knocked off course, becoming stretched and distorted, spilling out cold air and influencing the path of the jet stream. It happened in 2021, bringing fierce cold to Texas, leading to nearly 250 deaths and knocking out power to large parts of the state. This is where the link to climate change comes in. Some scientists believe polar vortex disruptions and changes to the jet stream are being driven by warming in the Arctic, which is heating up around four times faster than the rest of the planet. The idea has been gaining traction since a 2012 paper by Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts. It found that as the Arctic warms, the difference between the cold temperatures in the north and warm temperatures in the south is leading to a weaker, wavier jet stream, which pushes very cold air southwards. Her much-debated paper kicked off more research into this developing area of science. In 2021, Judah Cohen, a climatologist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published research which found rapid heating in parts of the Arctic, combined with high snowfall in Siberia, was making the jet stream more wavy and knocked the polar vortex off course. “We are not arguing that winters are getting colder overall,” Cohen told CNN last year. But the idea that climate change will mean fewer swings between extreme temperatures is “an oversimplification,” he said. The area of science remains very unsettled, however, and others have said the links between Arctic warming and cold snaps are far from clear. While there have been a number of very cold Northern Hemisphere winters coinciding with warm Arctic winters, the difficulty is unpicking cause from effect, said James Screen, professor in climate science at Exeter University, whose own research concluded Arctic warming is not a trigger for colder winters. Extreme cold snaps can be explained by normal climate variability, said Screen. In other words, even as winters get warmer, cold extremes will still occur. And climate change can also influence the severity of winter storms, as a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture leading to more intense rain or snow when it falls. As scientists work to unravel complex links between climate change and periods of intense cold, all agree on one thing: the trend is for warmer winters. “If you look at the data, we see that over the long term, global warming is leading to fewer and less severe cold extremes,” Screen said. Nouran Salahieh and Allison Chinchar contributed to reporting"
https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/16/climate/climate-denial-misinformation-youtube/index.html,"What is ‘new denial?’ An alarming wave of climate misinformation is spreading on YouTube, watchdog says",01-17-2024,"                                                 Many YouTubers undermining climate action no longer call global warming a hoax, but they are sowing doubt over the science, solutions and impacts of the crisis.                                             ","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","If you’ve been on YouTube lately, you might have come across someone claiming wind and solar energy don’t work, that rising sea levels will help coral reefs flourish, or that climate scientists are corrupt and alarmist. These are all false and misleading statements taken from a handful of thousands of YouTube videos analyzed by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), which has identified a stark change in the tactics of climate deniers over the past few years. Where once climate deniers would outright reject climate change as a hoax or scam, or claim that humans were not responsible for it, many are now shifting to a different approach, one which attempts to undermine climate science, cast doubt on climate solutions and even claim global warming will be beneficial at best, harmless at worst. The past five years have seen a “startling” rise in this “new denial,” according to a CCDH analysis published Tuesday, which also suggests this shift in narrative could also be helping YouTube video creators circumvent the social media company’s ban on monetizing climate denial. Researchers gathered transcripts from more than 12,000 videos posted between 2018 and 2023 across 96 YouTube channels that have promoted climate denial and misinformation. Transcripts were analyzed by artificial intelligence to categorize the climate denial narratives used as either “old denial” or “new denial.” “New denial” content — attacks on solutions, the science and the climate movement — now makes up 70% of all climate denial claims posted on YouTube, according to the report, up from 35% in 2018. Assertions that “global warming is not happening,” one of the main “old denial” claims the analysis focused on, declined from 48% of all denial claims in 2018 to 14% in 2023, the report found. Claims that climate solutions won’t work, however, soared from 9% to 30% over the same period. Imran Ahmed, chief executive officer and founder of CCDH, said the report in some ways is a story of success. “The climate movement has won the argument that climate change is real, and that it is hurting our planet’s ecosystems,” he told CNN. As the impacts of the climate crisis — from scorching heat waves to fierce storms — affect a broader swath of the global population, narratives that deny the existence of climate change are becoming less effective. But, he added, it’s also a huge warning. “Now that the majority of people recognize old climate denial as counterfactual and discredited, climate deniers have cynically concluded that the only way to derail climate action is to tell people the solutions don’t work.” “This new climate denial is no less insidious,” Ahmed said, “and it could hold enormous influence over public opinion on climate action for decades to come.” It’s particularly worrying because of the young demographic attracted to YouTube, according to the CCDH. A December survey from Pew Research Center found YouTube to be the most widely used social media platform it analyzed among 13- to 17-year olds, used by roughly nine in 10 of them. “Climate deniers now have access to vast global audiences through digital platforms,” Charlie Cray, senior strategist at Greenpeace, said in a statement. “Allowing them to steadily chip away at public support for climate action — especially among younger viewers — could have devastating consequences for the future of our planet.” The shift in tactics to undermine climate action could also help creators get around YouTube’s policy banning them from making money on climate denial content, the report suggests. In 2021, the company prohibited advertising against content that “contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change.” Yet YouTube is potentially making up to $13.4 million a year from ads on videos the report found to contain climate denial, according to the CCDH’s calculations, including ads from prominent sportswear companies, hotels and international nonprofits. “There aren’t many companies that would be happy about seeing their advertising appear next to clear climate denial content,” Ahmed said. “And I imagine they will be furious to find out that they are inadvertently funding climate denial content.” In a statement to CNN, a YouTube spokesperson said, “debate or discussions of climate change topics, including around public policy or research, is allowed.” However, the spokesperson added, “when content crosses the line to climate change denial, we stop showing ads on those videos. We also display information panels under relevant videos to provide additional information on climate change and context from third parties.” YouTube said its enforcement teams work quickly to review videos that may potentially violate policies, then act on them. The company said that after reviewing the CCDH report, it found some of the videos included did violate existing climate change policies and has since removed ads from them. However, it also said the majority of the videos in the analysis did not breach their policies. Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied the narrative shift in climate denial, said the findings were “disturbing.” “It is extremely unlikely that this is the result of organic social media activity,” Mann, who was not involved in the study, told CNN. “It suggests that bad actors have made a concerted effort to weaponize social media in a way that is especially targeted toward young people, recognizing that they are the greatest threat to the fossil fuel industry status quo, as evidenced by the tremendous impact of the youth climate movement.” Ahmed called on Google to boost its policies to deal with “new denial” content. “We’re asking Google to extend their ban on monetization and amplification of ‘old denial’ content to include ‘new denial’ as well,” Ahmed said, adding that other social media companies should also take note of the report’s findings. “We’re asking other platforms that claim to be green in one breath not to profit from, to revenue share, and therefore, reward or to amplify clear climate denial content that contradicts scientific consensus,” Ahmed added. “You can’t claim to be green but then be the world’s biggest megaphone for climate change-related disinformation.” This story has been updated"

","Laura Paddison, CNN","The UK government approved a £2 billion (around $2.5 billion) project on Tuesday to create a “carbon negative” wood-burning power plant. But some climate experts say it’s a costly experiment for a technology that may not be green. Energy secretary Claire Coutinho’s decision greenlights a plan to bolt carbon capture units onto two generators at a power station in Yorkshire, northern England, run by Drax. Once operational, each would be capable of preventing 4 million tons of carbon pollution a year from entering the atmosphere, according to the company. The carbon would then be stored under the North Sea, with the aim of preventing it from adding to global warming. Once the most polluting power station in western Europe, Drax switched from burning coal to burning biomass — mostly wood pellets — in 2019. The power station in Yorkshire, which produces around 4% of the UK’s power, mostly burns wood imported from North America. Biomass is already considered carbon neutral because even though carbon pollution is released when trees are burned, the idea is emissions are offset by the growth of new trees to replace those burned, which suck up carbon through photosynthesis as they grow. Adding carbon capture units will convert the plant to a form of energy called “bioenergy with carbon capture and storage,” or BECCS, which Drax says will allow it to remove more carbon pollution from the atmosphere than it is produced by burning the biomass, making it carbon negative. But the technology has been heavily criticized by some climate experts. “BECCS is an unproven and highly controversial technology that would come at significant financial cost to the UK public,” said Tomos Harrison, electricity transition analyst at energy think tank Ember. Some scientists have cast doubt on the climate credentials of burning biomass. A 2021 study from the European Academies Science Advisory Council concluded that burning wood for energy “is not effective in mitigating climate change and may even increase the risk of dangerous climate change.” A main criticism is that it takes decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be reabsorbed by new trees and plants as they grow. There are also concerns that wood sourcing may be damaging to forests. Last May, following a BBC investigation which alleged some of Drax’s wood came from mature forests in Canada, the UK energy regulator Ofgem launched an investigation into Drax over whether it had breached sustainability requirements in relation to the wood pellets it was burning. In response to Ofgem’s investigation, which is still ongoing, Drax said at the time it was confident in its compliance, and added that in 2022 the company had appointed a third party to “independently verify the accuracy of its biomass sustainability.” Drax has said it only uses wood from sustainable sources. Some experts believe money would be better spent on other renewable technology. Laith Whitwham, senior policy advisor at climate think tank E3G, said the renewable status of burning wood pellets remains “hotly contested” and Drax’s project was a distraction from where investment was most needed. “Public money would be better spent on increasing grid capacity and battery storage, and further expanding wind and solar generation,” he told CNN. Drax has received an average of around £785 million ($620 million) a year in government subsidies, according to Ember research. “BECCS is an expensive gamble,” concludes an Ember report published Tuesday, which calculated that the project could cost taxpayers up to £1.7 billion a year. A spokesperson for Drax said Ember’s report “veers between factual inaccuracies and a series of misguided assumptions.” In its own analysis published Tuesday, Drax said the development of BECCs at its power station would lead to savings of around £15 billion ($19 billion) for the UK. BECCS “offers the most cost-effective, straightforward and efficient way to help the country meet climate targets and could save billions of pounds, remove millions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere and support the UK’s energy security,” Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said in a statement Tuesaday. Gardiner called the government’s decision “another milestone” in the development of BECCs. He said it demonstrated the “critical role” Drax could have in “delivering large-scale carbon dioxide removals.” In its decision letter, the UK government said the project would “make a meaningful contribution to meeting the urgent need for carbon capture storage infrastructure to support the transition to Net Zero by 2050.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/16/climate/new-england-warm-rain-winter-skiing-climate/index.html,New Englanders are feeling extreme rain fatigue as winter arrives torturously late,01-16-2024,"                                                 Across much of northern New England, winter has been painstakingly late – and rainy.                                             ","Ella Nilsen, CNN","Across much of northern New England, winter has been painfully late – and rainy. Though the weather is about to turn more solidly cold, hardy New Englanders are bemoaning a start to the winter that’s so far been characterized by fog, rain and warmer temperatures – conditions that have dealt a blow to the region’s recreational lifeblood, including snowmobiling, ice fishing and skiing. When Vermont state fisheries biologist Shawn Good looks out at popular lakes that should be frozen solid by early January, he’s seen open water and winter anglers fishing in boats. The ice just hasn’t been there. “On January 12, it’s absolutely crazy to have some of our most popular lakes for ice fishing have open water, but that’s the situation right now,” Good said in a Friday interview. “We get these freeze-thaw cycles continuing to come around. We are seeing more people out fishing in boats right now than we’re seeing people fishing on the ice.” The warmer temperatures mean precipitation that could be snow is falling as rain. After enduring a historically wet summer last year, New Englanders got only more record-breaking rain in December. A massive coastal storm walloped the region, turning rivers into raging torrents and cutting power to over 800,000 people. That storm wreaked havoc on the Maine Snowmobile Association’s 14,000-mile network of trails, which it had just finished rebuilding from spring and summer washouts. The December storm “really crippled us; it was devastating,” association president Al Swett told CNN. “We got hit really hard. (Volunteers] just got everything back to normal and then this Christmas storm came, and it just wiped us right out. Every part of the state got devastated with rain or no snow.” That storm brought down trees and washed out bridges, Swett said, severe enough damage that repairs won’t be able to start in earnest until this summer. On top of the hit to the trail system, there has been very little snow, save for a few corners of the state. Although some snowmobile clubs in Maine are starting to get enough snow to get back out on the trails, Swett said he fears that will lead to crowded trails with more people riding in fewer areas – a concern for rider safety. Swett says winter in New England has changed significantly over his lifetime. “It’s not cold like it used to be in my day,” Swett said. “Back in the day we had a couple days of a January thaw, then it went back into winter, but that hasn’t happened. Global warming, I don’t know what else it would be. It’s pretty sad.” There is a certain kind of pride to East Coast skiing – being not only able, but eager, to navigate icy patches, tight turns and steep vertical drops on bitterly cold days. Skiing in wet snow is significantly less fun. “We’ve gotten too much rain, way too much rain,” said Ry Young, marketing and events manager at Mad River Glen – a cooperative ski resort in Vermont. “The temperature swings, the amount of moisture that’s coming with them, they’re all increasing. It wasn’t a huge surprise this year to see these storms come through and continue to drop these massive amounts of water on us.” Smaller amounts of rain or wet snow can actually be beneficial to help build up a solid base on mountains, Young said. But too much rain can be a disaster. “If you put a groomer on wet snow and it freezes, then you’re just going to end up with solidified corduroy,” Young said. In other words: “It’s going to be a solid frozen sheet of ice.” Managers at some New England ski resorts told CNN they are rolling with the punches with the help of manmade snow – a combination of highly pressurized water and cold enough temperatures. “It can’t be understated that it’s been a bit of a roller coaster of a weather pattern,” said Brandon Swartz, general manager of Attitash Mountain in New Hampshire. Swartz said his teams try to “strike while the cold is here” and maximize “every window of opportunity we have” to make snow. Manmade snow “can take more of a beating” from rain, Swartz said, because it is denser than natural snow and water can flow through it more easily. That has meant that even strong rainstorms haven’t washed all the snowpack away, letting crews at Attitash and other resorts not have to start their snowmaking operations completely from scratch. “It’s really come down to the improvements of the technology to help us navigate challenging times,” said JD Crichton, general manager at Wildcat Mountain in northern New Hampshire (Wildcat and Attitash are both owned by Vail Resorts). But some skiing operations in northern New England can’t take advantage of snowmaking. In Littleton, New Hampshire, a small rope-tow operation called the Mt. Eustis ski hill has been sitting dormant – waiting for enough natural snow to open. Skiing is an expensive sport, and unlike most resorts in the area, Mt. Eustis costs $5 per day – a suggested donation. After being closed for years, it reopened in 2016 to try to make skiing more cost-effective and accessible for locals. But its volunteers say its season is getting shorter, entirely dependent on the whims of warming winters. “We’re trying to be hopeful but there’s nothing we can do,” said John Tully, vice president of the operation’s board of directors. “It’s just a waiting game. Last week it was [forecasted] that we were going to get this huge storm and it just ended up being rain.” Attitash recently donated one of its grooming machines to Mt. Eustis, but it has just been sitting unused as everyone waits for consistent snow. And the ski hill’s board of directors has started talking about how they could diversify their operations in warmer seasons – trying to sustain it in the spring and summer for lack of winter snow. In New England, people often make small talk about the weather, and there’s been no shortage of grumbling about the winter rain, Tully said. “There is this sort of feeling that we got a lot of rain, if this was only snow,” he said. “With the hottest year being this past year, things are definitely changing. We see it, we feel it.”"

Here’s the latest: • Record snowless streaks end: Enough snow fell in New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC, to end nearly 2-year-long waits for an inch of snow there. The cities all recorded at least an inch of snow in 24 hours, something that hadn’t been done in more than 700 days in all the locations. The streaks were record-long in Baltimore, New York, Philadelphia and the DC area’s Dulles International Airport. • Record-breaking cold temperatures: Nearly 80% of the US will see below-freezing temperatures over the next week as another shot of cold air spreads across the country by late week. Numerous daily cold records have already been set – including across Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. It snowed as far south as Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, on Tuesday morning, and while there was no accumulation, both cities reported rare snowfall for a few hours. Hundreds of Alabama National Guardsmen jumped into action to assist motorists and clear vehicles on Interstate 65. Hard freeze warnings are expected Tuesday evening for much of the Gulf Coast, from Texas to Florida. Temperatures in Memphis, Dallas and Nashville are expected to stay below freezing for at least 72 consecutive hours. • Frostbite can happen in minutes: Much of the Rockies, Great Plains and Midwest will see life-threatening sub-zero wind chills into Wednesday, with wind chills as low as minus 30 degrees over the Northern Plains. “These wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in a few minutes and hypothermia shortly thereafter,” the National Weather Service warned. • At least 12 deaths across several states: Deaths have been reported across Arkansas, Oregon, Mississippi, Kansas and Tennessee since January 12 as back-to-back winter storms have pummeled the US with dangerous wind, ice and snow. One person was killed and another was injured in Arkansas after their pickup truck careened off a snowy White County highway and hit a tree, according to state police. • Icy roads make travel dangerous: Wintry conditions were reported on roads in at least a half-dozen southern states Tuesday morning. Crashes on a slick I-10 in southern Louisiana closed an expansive stretch of the highway in both directions Tuesday morning. Transportation departments across the region urged people to stay home and off roads as they tried to combat the conditions. “Hundreds” of travel incidents unfolded on Tennessee roads Monday, the state’s DOT said. • 10,000 flights cancelled: The transportation toll from a hyperactive stretch of winter weather goes beyond roads. More than 10,000 flights have been cancelled since Friday, FlightAware data shows. Most cancellations Tuesday were in the East because of the active storm, but the flight issues stretch as far west as Denver. • Schools and government offices are closed: School districts in more than half a dozen states, including Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and West Virginia announced closures amid the frigid temperatures. Federal government offices closed in Washington, DC, for the first time since Jan. 7, 2022 because of the weather. As dangerously cold temperatures continue across much of the US – with more than 95 million people in 35-plus states under winter weather alerts – snow and freezing rain over the South spread into the mid-Atlantic, Northeast and New England through Tuesday. Downwind of the Great Lakes, heavy lake effect snowfall is expected to stir up some significant travel headaches. Lake Effect snow happens when cold air moves across the open, unfrozen waters of the Great Lakes, creating narrow bands that produce 2 to 3 inches of snow per hour or more. Buffalo, New York, is under a lake effect snow warning from Tuesday afternoon through Thursday evening, with heavy lake effect snowfall of 1 to 3 feet and gusts to 40 mph possible. Watertown, also under a winter storm watch through early Friday, could see heavy lake effect snowfall of 2 to 3 feet possible. “Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility,” the National Weather Service office in Buffalo warned. “The hazardous conditions could impact the Wednesday morning and evening commute.” This region had just received over 3 feet of snowfall from a previous round of very heavy lake effect snowfall. New York City received 1.6 inches of snow after not getting an inch of snow fall in a single day in more than 700 days. Washington, DC, received 4.1 inches of snow from the storm, ending the city’s streak without at least an inch of snow in 728 days. Philadelphia also broke its snow drought with 1.5 inches falling as of early Tuesday after 715 days of not seeing an inch of snowfall. As the Northeast deals with snow, another storm will move onshore over the Pacific Northwest from Tuesday into Wednesday as the region continues recovering from a damaging storm that hit late last week. An ice storm warning is in place for over 3 million people across the region, including Portland, with freezing rain set to arrive there in the late afternoon, close to the evening commute. Enough ice could accumulate to cause damage to trees and power lines, threatening power outages. The city’s school district said all public schools will be closed Wednesday due to the ongoing ice storm. The system will also bring rain over parts of the Pacific Northwest into California, with snow over higher elevations. Temperatures are expected to moderate Wednesday before a new surge of cold air will arrive over the northern Plains and Midwest and the Deep South by the end of the week, according to the weather service. Wind chill temperatures – how cold the air feels on exposed skin – are expected to remain at hazardous lows that cause frostbite and hypothermia. Dangerously cold wind chills as low as 30 below zero are expected in North Dakota and other parts of the Northern Plains Wednesday. Subzero wind chills will spread as far east as New England and as far south as Mississippi. “Avoid outdoor activities if possible. If you must be outside, wear appropriate clothing, dress in layers, and cover exposed skin. Keep pets indoors,” the National Weather Service said. “Have a cold survival kit if you must travel.” CNN Meteorologist Sara Tonks and CNN’s Zenebou Sylla, Sarah Dewberry, Amy Simonson, Andi Babineau, Gregory Wallace and Pete Muntean contributed to this report."

Fourteen people were killed across Tenessee due to the severe weather, the state’s emergency management agency said Wednesday, citing the state department of health. Five people died in Pennsylvania when their minivan lost control on a snow-covered I-81, the coroner’s office in Lackawanna County said. • Another round of snow and cold coming: More accumulating snow is likely from the Midwest to the East on Friday. Light totals could once again blanket Washington, DC, and New York City soon after their nearly two-year wait for an inch of snow ended early this week. In the South, winter weather alerts are also in effect across Nashville, Lexington and Charleston, West Virginia, on Thursday. Read on for a more detailed forecast. • Ice knocks out power, creates treacherous travel in Northwest: Freezing rain and wind pelting the Pacific Northwest knocked out power to more than 85,000 homes and businesses in Oregon Wednesday morning amid frigid temperatures. By Wednesday evening, power outages in Oregon had dropped below 50,000. Icy roadways and downed trees and power lines created dangerous travel conditions that triggered road closures Tuesday night and Wednesday. A nearly 50 mile-stretch of I-84 from west of Portland to the eastern side of the Oregon Cascades was shut down Tuesday night due to the ice threat, according to the state’s department of transportation. That portion remained closed Wednesday evening due to unsafe conditions, and it’s unclear when it will reopen, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office said. • Buffalo, New York, drivers face snowy conditions: Lake-effect snow warnings are in effect until Thursday night in Buffalo, where additional snow accumulations of 9 to 18 inches are possible in some areas. The surrounding area could see 1 to 3 feet of localized snowfall and wind gusts up to 40 mph. More than 30 inches of snow had fallen south of Buffalo in Lackawanna, New York, as of Wednesday morning. “Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Areas of blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions will impact the morning commute,” the weather service warned. “Bitter wind chills as low as 10 below zero could result in hypothermia if precautions are not taken.” Relief from the cold will be short-lived with another push of bone-chilling air set to arrive across the north-central US late Thursday. The abnormal cold will rush across much of the central and eastern US by Friday afternoon and remain in place for most of the weekend. High temperatures will struggle to reach the freezing mark in Oklahoma City, Nashville, Philadelphia and New York City on Friday. Chicago won’t be able to break out of the teens and Minneapolis will be stuck in the single digits Friday as the harsh cold settles into place. Wind chills across the central US will plunge back to dangerous levels by Friday, increasing the risk for frostbite and hypothermia. Another round of snow will overspread portions of the Midwest and East on Friday as two pieces of atmospheric energy – one of which can be traced back to the Northwest storm – collide. Snow will begin as early as Thursday night in Chicago, and by Friday morning, accumulating snow will stretch into the interior Northeast and central Appalachians. Cities in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast that just ended record-long snow droughts from an early week storm, including Washington, DC, New York and Philadelphia, will once again have the chance for a light-to-moderate snow. Around 1 to 3 inches of snow are likely from the Midwest to the East, but some parts of the Appalachians may see totals closer to half a foot by the time snow ends Friday night. Despite low snowfall amounts, the combination of snow and breezy winds could lead to tricky travel. Additional cancellations and delays are also possible, especially after schools and government offices were shuttered by the similarly impactful early-week storm. Back-to-back storms are delivering a deadly “1-2 punch” to the Northwest with freezing rain and ice in Oregon and Washington and heavy snow through the region’s interior through the end of the week, the weather service said. At least seven people died in the Portland, Oregon, area since Friday from severe winter weather. Four hypothermia deaths are being investigated in Multnomah County, which includes the city of Portland, county officials told CNN. Millions in the region were under ice storm warnings early Wednesday, including hard-hit Portland, after a new storm moved onshore Tuesday night. As the severe weather threat persists, Portland Public Schools plan to close Thursday for the third day, the district announced. Ice and wind combined to bring down trees across the Portland area with deadly effect. A tree came crashing down on an elderly man who was asleep on the second floor of his home, killing him, in Lake Oswego, Oregon, fire marshal Gert Zoutendijk told CNN. “I don’t have enough words to describe what that looked like,” Lake Oswego Police Chief George Burke said during an emergency city council meeting Tuesday. Winter storm warnings also extend over the Cascades and northern Rockies. Up to 3 feet of snow could fall over the Cascades through Thursday afternoon and up to 2 feet is possible in higher elevation areas in the northern parts of Washington, Idaho and Montana by late Thursday morning. CNN’s Nouran Salahieh, Joe Sutton, Aya Elamroussi, Andy Rose, Sarah Dewberry, Raja Razek and Jennifer Henderson contributed to this report."

Tracking their movements, they used motion sensor data from GPS collars worn by the goats and found the species — which is normally diurnal, meaning active by day — has become more nocturnal. The change in behavior can be attributed to feeling increased “heat stress,” Francesca Brivio, one of the co-authors of the study, told CNN. While goats are typically diurnal, warmer temperatures during the day mean they have to expend more energy foraging for food. “This is also true for humans,” said Brivio, “[when] it is very hot, we stop working or we go inside home to avoid the sun.” By foraging at night, they can preserve more energy — but this can also bring new risks. The research, which was conducted in Italy’s Gran Paradiso National Park and Switzerland’s Swiss National Park, surprised scientists with one of its findings: They expected the species to be less active at night in areas where wolves, which are nocturnal predators, are active. But this wasn’t the case. “We conjecture that for ibex, it is more important to avoid the heat stress rather than avoid predation risk,” Brivio said. Not only does moving in the dark make it harder for these daytime animals to detect predators with their limited vision, but the ibex live on rocky slopes, which make movement and foraging riskier during the night. The study suggests that these new behaviors could ultimately lead to reduced reproduction and survival rates. “Habits can change,” said Brivio, “but at the moment, these findings seem to put ibex in some risk for the future.” Their research is not the first to detect how animals are adapting their behavior to rising global temperatures. “With increasing global warming, these shifts from diurnal to nocturnal activity will be increased,” she said. As global warming and human activity push some animals toward nocturnality, the authors of the study highlighted the urgency of changing current management and conservation practices. For example, a census that counts the number of ibex in protected areas is done only at dusk and dawn, Brivio noted. This increased nighttime activity means new methodologies must be developed for park rangers to have an accurate assessment of the animal population. She says it might also be valuable to prevent tourists from visiting areas that the ibex critically need for foraging."

But what if the battle to stay under this limit has already been lost?                                             ,"Laura Paddison, CNN","For years, the fight against climate change has been symbolized by one number: 1.5. Ever since countries agreed in 2015 to an ambition of restricting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the number has become synonymous with staving off catastrophic climate change. But what if the battle to keep global warming from overshooting this limit has already been lost? Some prominent scientists argue it has and it’s irresponsible to sugarcoat the truth. For others, that view is not only wrong, but even “dangerous.” It was the renowned climate scientist James Hansen whose comments fueled the debate. In November, he declared the 1.5 degree-limit “deader than a doornail,” saying it was a shortcoming of the scientific community “to not make clear to the political leaders what the situation is.” The rate of global warming is accelerating, he said at a news conference in November, and the world is certain to blow past 1.5 degrees of warming. “Anybody who understands the physics knows that.” Hansen’s words have heft — he is widely credited as the first scientist to publicly sound the alarm on climate change in the 1980s. But other scientists have pushed back hard. “I’ve got three degrees in physics, and I can tell you that Jim is wrong,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, referring to Hansen. The problem isn’t physics, it’s politics, he told CNN. “And political obstacles can be overcome.” The response from Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute, was even blunter. “I think that’s a very stupid thing to say,” she told reporters in November. “At the moment, (1.5 degrees) is within reach and to pretend it’s not will just lead to doing nothing even longer.” Disagreements over climate science are not uncommon — our planet is a highly complex system, and the nature of reaching consensus typically starts with scientists who disagree. But as global warming fuels extreme weather — like heat waves, cyclones and even fierce winter storms, such as those that have torn through parts of the United States — the debate over the future of 1.5 is getting unusually heated. As many parts of the US and Europe deal with an Arctic blast of brutally cold air, it can be hard to recall just how hot 2023 was. Last year saw unprecedented global temperatures, with heat records around the world tumbling. El Niño — a natural climate phenomenon that tends to boost the planet’s average temperature — collided with the long-term trend of global warming, making 2023 the hottest year on record. The year came within a whisker of breaching 1.5 degrees, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service. While scientists are most concerned about long-term warming over many years, not just one, 2023’s record heat was a stark warning sign. If the world breaches 1.5 degrees over the long term, scientists say the impacts of climate change will start to exceed the ability of humans and ecosystems to adapt. But every fraction of a degree matters, and climate chaos is already emerging. “It’s not that before 1.5 everything’s fine and after 1.5 an asteroid will fall on our heads,” Otto told CNN. Keeping warming below 1.5 degrees is not a physical threshold, but a political goal, she said. Over just a few years, the world has warmed from 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels to around 1.2 degrees today — fractions of a degree that have translated to record breaking extreme weather. For Hansen, the recent global heat offers persuasive proof that 1.5 is dead. “I have not spent much time arguing about this point… because I know that nature is in the process of proving that we are right,” he told CNN. He predicts that by May, the planet will have experienced a 12-month period with an average temperature 1.6 to 1.7 degrees higher than pre-industrial levels. “For all practical purposes we are only going to be looking at 1.5 degrees in the rearview mirror,” he said. At the center of Hansen’s argument is his much-debated assertion that the planet is warming much faster than predicted. He points to the imbalance between the energy coming in from the sun and what leaves through heat radiating into space. This imbalance has doubled, meaning global warming is escalating, he argued in a November paper he co-authored with more than a dozen other scientists. The paper’s scientists attribute this mainly to successful global efforts to tackle shipping pollution. Ships burn fossil fuels that produce carbon emissions, which have a significant impact on global warming. But ships’ exhaust fumes also contain sulfur dioxide. In what may seem a strange twist, the pollutant – which is highly hazardous for human health – has a global cooling impact, as the particles reflect sunlight away from the Earth. Hansen’s research predicts the world will breach the long-term 1.5-degree benchmark this decade, and 2 degrees before 2050. That would mean the world has failed to deliver on the central goal in the Paris Agreement on climate change, under which countries pledged to limit warming to well below 2 degrees. Bill McGuire, emeritus professor of Earth sciences at University College London, shares Hansen’s concerns about the pace of change. “The energy balance of our world is now hugely out of kilter,” McGuire told CNN, adding it’s “frankly terrifying.” But for many other scientists, there simply isn’t the evidence to say global warming is speeding up. At least not yet. Chris Smith, a climate modeling expert at the University of Leeds in the UK said it was too early to make the claim. “We would need three or four years of data really that all points in the same direction,” he told CNN. Last year’s unprecedented heat was boosted by El Niño, Mann said, and “does not constitute a change in the trend line.” The rate of global warming did accelerate after the 1970s as clean air laws reduced air pollution, but since then, “the planet has warmed at a roughly constant rate,” he said. The reality is bad enough, he added. ﻿“There is no need to exaggerate.” Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, said there have been recent climate events that scientists are struggling to understand, including 2023’s record-shattering ocean temperatures. But in terms of Hansen’s warning about the significant impacts on global warming of cleaning up shipping pollution, “we don’t see the signal,” she said. Few scientists will dispute that the world faces a daunting path to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. Even with current climate policies, the planet is on course for nearly 3 degrees of warming. In some ways, the split between them is, at its heart, a debate about the value of having the 1.5 degree limit in the first place. If we say 1.5 degrees is dead, Otto said, “that means, for a lot of people, probably the conclusion is, ‘OK, then it’s not even worth trying.’” Smith said it risks playing into a “fatalistic narrative that is actually quite dangerous,” potentially persuading leaders to think “we’ve failed, anything goes now.” Remaining under 1.5 degrees is going to be “very difficult,” but it’s too early to say it’s impossible, he told CNN. Mann said it was “irresponsible” to claim 1.5 degrees is dead when the world can avoid crossing the threshold by making substantial and immediate reductions in carbon pollution. McGuire takes the opposite view. There is no feasible way the world can meet this limit which would require nearly halving emissions by 2030, he said. “To suggest otherwise is duplicitous and presents a false picture of where we are.”​ Framing 1.5 as a “target” to be reached, rather than a limit to stay under, has given the illusion we have more time than we do to tackle the crisis, he said, and has allowed countries and companies keep burning fossil fuels. But one major concern is that if politicians abandon 1.5 degrees, they won’t strive to restrict global warming to 1.6 or 1.7 degrees, but will instead focus on 2 degrees — the upper limit countries committed to in the 2015 Paris Agreement. “That is a huge danger, and that would really be catastrophic,” said Otto. Between 1.5 and 2 degrees lies disaster: The risk of triggering a slew of climate tipping points, including ice sheet melting and mass coral reef death, and the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. We will reach 1.5 degrees as a global average temperature, probably next year, Otto said. “Whether we stay there, or how much we go above that, really is still a political question and it is in our gift to change that.”"

Back-to-back ice storms brought down trees and power lines in the state since Saturday – now a third storm is impacting the area. At least 10 people have died in the Portland, Oregon, area since Friday from the storms and cold. Three people died in Portland on Wednesday after a tree branch took down a live power line that fell onto their vehicle. Portland fire officials said the live wire killed them after they exited their SUV. “When the feet of the individuals touched the ground, and their bodies were touching the car, they became part of the active electrical circuit which resulted in their deaths,” Portland Fire said. A good Samaritan rescued an unharmed baby from the street. The Samaritan “grabbed the baby off one of the adults lying in the street for the safety of the child,” Portland Fire said. The ice storm responsible departed the Northwest late Wednesday, with the next storm quick on its heels Thursday morning. Freezing rain once again spread over the lower elevations in Washington and Oregon on Thursday with heavy snow in portions of the Cascades. Ice will continue to build across the hard-hit Northwest as the freezing rain pounds the area into Friday. Additional ice may weigh down tree limbs, making them more prone to snapping, and damage power lines. More than 45,000 homes and businesses in Washington and Oregon were without power Thursday because of the previous storms. Another round of snow will overspread portions of the Midwest and East on Friday as two pieces of atmospheric energy – one of which can be traced back to Wednesday’s deadly ice storm in the Northwest – collide. Snow will begin as early as Thursday night in Chicago, and by Friday morning, accumulating snow will stretch into the interior Northeast and central Appalachians. Another round of sloppy wintry mix targeted the Mississippi Valley Thursday morning. Freezing rain made travel treacherous in parts of Arkansas and Mississippi, according to National Weather Service reports. Additional freezing rain, mixing with a little snow at times late Thursday, will make travel slick and hazardous across parts of the Tennessee Valley. Cities in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast that just ended record-long snow droughts from an early week storm, including Washington, DC, New York and Philadelphia, will once again see light-to-moderate snow. Around 1 to 3 inches of snow are likely from the Midwest to the East. But parts of the Appalachians and a few areas closer to the coast may see totals approach half a foot by the time snow ends Friday night. Philadelphia could receive between 4 and 6 inches of snow Friday. Six inches of snow hasn’t fallen in a single day in the city in more than three years. It will not be a blockbuster snowstorm, but the combination of snow and breezy winds could cause tricky travel. Additional cancellations and delays are also possible, especially after schools and government offices were shuttered by the similarly impactful early-week storm. The slight relief from bone-chilling weather Wednesday in the central US and Thursday in the South and East will be short-lived. Another push of abnormal cold will arrive across the north-central US later Thursday and will rush across the central and eastern US by Friday afternoon. While this round of cold is less potent than the one earlier in the week, high temperatures will struggle to reach the freezing mark in Oklahoma City, Nashville, Philadelphia and New York City on Friday. Chicago won’t be able to break out of the teens and Minneapolis will be stuck in the single digits Friday as the harsh cold settles into place. Wind chills across the central US will plunge back to dangerous levels by Friday, increasing the risk of frostbite and hypothermia. CNN’s Nouran Salahieh, Joe Sutton, Aya Elamroussi, Andy Rose, Sarah Dewberry, Raja Razek and Jennifer Henderson contributed to this report."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is changing the way it responds to natural disasters, it announced Friday, as the climate crisis fuels more extreme weather events and causes more destruction to people’s homes. The measures include giving wider access to an immediate $750 per person impacted by extreme weather, which can include storms, hurricanes, fires and tornadoes. The rules will take effect on March 22. The overhaul of FEMA’s system comes after years of criticism that disaster survivors have to jump through hoops to access assistance that’s needed immediately. Other criticisms include inequity of who can access help, and inadequate payouts to help people rebuild damaged homes. Deanne Criswell, who heads FEMA, told reporters on Thursday that the uptick in extreme weather called for a faster and more streamlined assistance program. “The fact that Mother Nature is not letting up, the fact that we are breaking records year after year as disasters become deadly, more frequent, and more severe — we need to be better prepared to recover from natural disasters faster and more effectively,” Criswell said, adding that the changes were the most significant in two decades. Criswell acknowledged criticisms of long wait times and additional red tape survivors have to navigate in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, and as they try to rebuild their homes. “What I can tell all of you is that we can do better and that the survivors deserve better,” Criswell said. Under the new approach, more survivors of disasters will be eligible for a one-time $750 payment, which is disbursed to help with costs like food, shelter, and evacuation, and make access to funds for home repairs easier. FEMA will also establish a new fund for immediate housing, aimed at giving survivors flexibility on what kind of accommodation to stay in, including friends’ and relatives’ homes. “This benefit is going to bridge the gap for those who need rental assistance and keep survivors housed in the aftermath of an event,” Criswell said. The human-caused climate crisis is fuelling an increase in the severity and number of extreme weather events. Governments around the world are having to pour more money into disaster response. FEMA is also stripping previous requirements making disaster survivors apply for US Small Business Administration loans before they are considered eligible for funds for personal property losses. It’s also scrapping a previous insurance cap that prevented disaster survivors getting additional assistance to help rebuild their homes. “We are eliminating red tape, expanding eligibility, and establishing new benefits so that we can get more survivors more support,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters. “Today we are delivering for the people who most need our help, when they need it most.” In addition, FEMA will implement several more changes to attempt to connect more people to assistance, making it easier for late applicants to get in the queue for assistance and making the appeals process easier for those who are denied. The agency is also rolling out new websites for disaster and temporary lodging that are intended to be easier for survivors to navigate. Criswell said FEMA “took a hard look” at its assistance programs as it planned the overhaul. “We knew that there was so much more we could be doing to help survivors get the assistance that they need to get back on their feet,” she said. The funding for the new programs will still come from the agency’s disaster relief fund, which came close to running out of money last year amid a record number of billion-dollar disasters, combined with delays in Congress passing a spending bill to replenish it. In 2023, the US experienced 28 separate weather and climate disasters costing at least $1 billion in damage, according to a final tally from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Last year saw deadly disasters, from Maui’s wildfires to historic summer floods in New England. But the costliest disaster was the drought impacting the South and Midwest, which decreased crop yields and lead to a saltwater intrusion into southern Louisiana’s water supply. The drought impacts alone cost around $14.5 billion. The agency has found itself responding to disasters year-round. Just a few weeks into 2024, strong coastal and winter storms have not let up. A major coastal storm surge and heavy rain battered Maine, leading to historic flooding in some parts of the state – and its second such storm this year. FEMA officials are already starting to assess that storm’s damage in Maine. CNN’s Angela Dewan contributed to this report. This story has been updated."

Mother Nature has a change in store: A dramatic weather pattern change is coming next week that will flip the brutal cold on its head. Few spots in the continental US have escaped the cold over the last week. Its wind chills plunged below minus 40 degrees in parts of the central US; it smashed hundreds of temperature records; it produced one of the coldest NFL games on record; and it made for the coldest Iowa caucuses ever held. But by next week, frigid cold will be a distant memory across the mainland US as unseasonably mild conditions wipe out the chill. In some spots, it’ll feel more like March than January. Above-average temperatures are forecast for the entire Lower 48 starting Tuesday, according to a temperature outlook from the Climate Prediction Center. A significant shift in the weather pattern in the upper levels of the atmosphere, where the jet stream flows, is driving this change. During the ongoing cold pattern, the jet stream – a river of air that acts as a divider between warm and cold air – has been draped across the southern tier of the US. This positioning allows bursts of cold air to race from the Arctic, rush through Canada and barrel deep into the US. But the jet stream will be positioned farther north across the US next week. This will do two things simultaneously: trap very cold air in Canada and allow warm air from the tropics to surge northward into the US. The warming trend will begin as early as Sunday for parts of the West and north-central US. Milder conditions will expand in scope and strength across more of the country gradually early next week. Chicago could finally rise above freezing on Monday. It could be the first time since Saturday afternoon that thermometers in the city eclipse the 32 degree mark. But the most drastic temperature changes from week-to-week will happen by midweek in the central and eastern US. Parts of the Plains and Midwest will flip from temperatures 30 to 40 degrees below average last Sunday to temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average by next Wednesday. Both Des Moines, Iowa, and Minneapolis will undergo 40- to 50-degree temperature swings from this week’s brutal cold to next week’s unseasonable warmth. The high temperature in Des Moines on Sunday failed to climb past minus 7 degrees. By next Wednesday, a high in the upper 30s is expected – more akin to March. Minneapolis only hit 2 degrees on Sunday but will surge to a springlike high around 40 degrees next Wednesday. It will feel more like late February farther east. Highs in the 40s will be common by midweek in Indianapolis, Cleveland, Philadelphia and New York City. And this above-average warmth is likely to persist through the end of January across much of the country, according to the Climate Prediction Center."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/20/travel/artificial-snowmaking-technology-climate-intl/index.html,New artificial snowmaking technology could offer a lifeline to struggling ski resorts,01-22-2024,                                                 A Spanish ski resort is testing a new snowmaking technique that promises to be far less resource intensive and produce snow at warmer temperatures.                                             ,"Laura Paddison, CNN","Nestled in the Pyrenees mountains, La Molina is Spain’s oldest ski resort. It boasts the biggest superpipe in the Pyrenees and its slopes have hosted high-profile events, from the Alpine Skiing World Cup to the Snowboard World Championships. But La Molina now faces an existential threat: A dearth of snow. As global temperatures rise, the resort, like many around the world, is being forced to rely increasingly on artificial snow. But fake snow comes at a cost. It is both water and energy intensive — a difficult combination anywhere but especially in a country grappling with a prolonged and severe drought fueled by climate change. That’s why La Molina will spend the next three years testing a new snowmaking technique that promises to be far less resource intensive, as well as being able to produce snow at warmer temperatures — increasingly important as some resorts are approaching temperatures too warm to make even fake snow viable. Called the Snow Laboratory, and run by the Barcelona Institute of Materials Science (ICMAB-CSIC) and FGC Turisme, which manages public ski slopes, the project will make fake snow by adding a mineral to the water going into snow guns, the machines that pump out water and air at high pressure to create snow. The idea is to mimic processes that happen in the clouds, said Albert Verdaguer, the scientist at ICMAB-CSIC who has been leading the project. Ice is formed in the atmosphere from water droplets in clouds by a process called “ice nucleation.” Pure water droplets can remain unfrozen in clouds at temperatures as low as minus 38 degrees Celsius. But ice nucleation can happen at much higher temperatures when the water droplets interact with particles in the atmosphere, such as aerosols or dust, triggering them to freeze. A couple of years ago, Verdaguer read a research paper which found that one mineral — feldspar — was particularly efficient at this process and could trigger the freezing of water droplets at temperatures close to zero degrees. It set off a lightbulb: What if feldspar could help make snowmaking more efficient? “We thought, why don’t we take advantage of that?” he told CNN. During lab tests, Verdaguer and his team found the technique reduced energy costs by around 30% and was able to produce snow at temperatures around 1 to 1.5 degrees higher than traditional methods. They were also able to get a better “conversion ratio,” Verdaguer said, referring to the volume of snow that comes out of the guns in relation to the amount of water that goes in. Usually, it’s around 75%, he said, as some water remains in the gun or doesn’t freeze and is blown away. The Snow Laboratory expects to increase that to 90%. Roughly a Coke can-sized amount of feldspar — an abundant mineral which makes up roughly 60% of the Earth’s crust — would keep two snow guns running all season, said Verdaguer. Spain has been struggling with scorching heat waves an﻿d a years-long drought, and Catalonia, the region where La Molina is located, has been particularly hard hit. It’s “one of the most intense droughts in recent years,” said Ramón Pascual Berghaenel, a meteorologist at Spain’s weather agency AEMET. But La Molina is far from the only ski resort trying to plot a future in a warmer, dryer world. An unusually warm winter last year left ski resorts across Europe bare of snow, and this year, resorts in the Indian Himalayas lay empty as a lack of snow kept tourists away. “Of course, there are shifts and changes year on year, but the long term trend (for snow) is decline,” said sports ecologist Madeleine Orr, who is not involved in the Snow Laboratory. Over the past four decades, human-caused global warming has led to reduced snow across much of the Northern Hemisphere, a recent study shows. These changes mean artificial snow, used by resorts for decades, is increasingly becoming a lifeline. “Current best estimates are that 95% of ski resorts rely on snowmaking to some extent to remain viable,” Orr told CNN. But as temperatures rise, there are questions over how viable snowmaking will be in the future. When it’s not cold enough, the machines simply won’t work. That’s why Snow Laboratory’s new technique is so appealing. The science makes sense, said Jordy Hendrikx, a leading snow scientist and the chief scientific advisor for Antarctica New Zealand. “It’s a question of whether that can be scaled,” Hendrikx,  who is not involved in the Snow Laboratory, told CNN. That’s exactly what the La Molina project aims to do — to see if the lab results can be replicated in the real world. For the past few weeks, Verdaguer and colleagues have been setting up the snow guns at the resort. The water will come from a reservoir which fills with melted snow from the mountains in the spring and isn’t used for drinking water. As well as testing snowmaking efficiency, the project will undertake environmental tests to make sure there are no adverse impacts. Verdaguer is confident there won’t be, as feldspar is already widely used in glassmaking, ceramics and paints. “If this new technology is able to produce snow with less water, and without adding extra chemical agents … that could be a huge win,” Orr said. But Hendrikx warned that even if the technique lives up to its promise, it may not be enough. As temperatures and humidity levels continue to climb, he said, “the improvement you’ve got to make has to be quite significant to outweigh what the natural environment is producing.” More broadly, Hendrickx believes snowmaking is a “maladaptation,” an attempt to adapt to climate change that can end up having a harmful effect. “You’re solving a problem locally, but you’re increasing the problem globally by your energy usage.” Resorts could use green energy for fake snow, but as the world electrifies, Hendrikx said, this clean energy could arguably be better used elsewhere, “rather than making snow for a very small percentage of the population.” And this hits on a bigger problem: Declining snowpack is a problem far beyond the ski industry. “Snow represents our water towers,” said Hendrikx, acting as free storage when people need it most. If it falls as rain, or melts earlier than usual, “we don’t have that trickle down later in the spring and the summer when we really need it.” Hendrikx gets why resorts make snow. Mountain economies rely on it. Tourists have come to see snow as a resource that can be bent to their desire to ski or snowboard on powdery white slopes at certain times of the year. Ultimately, resorts are not going to stop making snow any time soon, he said, so “any way we can find more efficient ways to do that, let’s get on it,” he said. The next three years will see Snow Laboratory test its technique at La Molina but also eventually at two other ski resorts in the region to explore how well it works under different conditions. The hope is this technology will give breathing room to struggling mountain communities that depend heavily on snow, Vedaguer said. “We don’t want all the ski resorts to be closed in five years or 10 years, and not have had time to really think something through for the economy of the regions,” he said. “This is just to give us some time.”"

The death toll climbed on Sunday after emergency management agencies in Oregon, Mississippi and Tennessee reported additional weather-related fatalities. Now a series of fronts and low-pressure systems are working together to bring warmer air and tropical moisture into the eastern half of the US this week. The arctic chill will be ending, and cities will begin warming up, with some seeing daily high temperatures increase by close to 30 degrees over the course of three or four days. Temperatures will be significantly above average by the end of the week, with highs Thursday reaching the upper 60s to low 70s throughout the Southeast and temperatures in the 50s as far north as New York. Overnight lows will soar into the 60s for parts of the Southeast, potentially breaking over 100 records for warmest daily lows. This warmer air will finally chase out the arctic blast that his been dominating the majority of the country’s weather this weekend, but will bring several potential hazards, including ice and flooding. As moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is pushed northward Sunday into Monday, it will collide with cold air still lingering over portions of the central US to create ice and freezing rain in a wide swath from Dallas almost as far north as Fort Wayne, Indiana. “Meanwhile, the presence of arctic air farther north will support mixed precipitation, sleet and ice as the moisture reaches into Oklahoma and Kansas tonight,” the Weather Prediction Center said. Multiple state transportation offices urged travelers to stay off the roads. “Freezing rain is expected across most of the state overnight through Monday creating potentially icy conditions. Please avoid travel if possible or delay your trip,” the Missouri Department of Transportation said Sunday afternoon in a post on X, formerly Twitter. In Arkansas, transportation officials warned Monday’s commute would be severely impacted as a result of freezing rain late Sunday evening into the start of the work week. The National Weather Service issued an ice storm warning for parts of Arkansas and Oklahoma. A winter storm warning is also in effect for some areas of Oklahoma. Weather service forecasters in Tulsa warned of “significant icing,” – between a quarter to a half-inch of ice accumulation – along with 15 to 20 mph sustained wind speeds and higher gusts. “Scattered to numerous power outages may result from the combination of ice accumulation and wind,” Tulsa’s weather service office said in a forecast message. The majority of the regions facing an icy forecast are likely to receive less than a quarter of an inch of ice by Monday evening, but up to half an inch of ice is in the forecast for northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, according to the National Weather Service. As the warm air continues its northward trajectory, freezing rain and icy precipitation will transition to rain, bringing the threat of flooding. Approximately 37 million people are under threat of flash flooding and excessive rainfall this week from Monday to Thursday morning along the Gulf Coast and in the western portions of the Southeast. There is a Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall and flash flooding moving eastward throughout the week: • Monday – eastern Texas• Tuesday – Lower Mississippi River Valley• Wednesday – Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee• Thursday to Friday morning – Gulf coast of Mississippi and Alabama into Tennessee Some areas will be under a Level 2 risk of excessive rainfall for several days in a row. Rainfall totals over the next five days may reach 5 to 6 inches with localized areas getting higher amounts. The regions most impacted by the heavy rain are also slightly at risk of developing severe weather, the Lake Charles, Louisiana, the weather service office said."

In December, the legislation was used to sentence a climate protester to a six-month prison term for taking part in a slow march on a public road as part of the activist group Just Stop Oil. The protester is now appealing the sentence. “It had been almost unheard of since the 1930s for members of the public to be imprisoned for peaceful protest in the UK,” Forst wrote. A spokesperson for the UK Home Office, the government department that tackles policing and other elements of national security, said that “while decisions on custodial sentences are a matter for the independent judiciary, the Public Order Act brings in new criminal offences and proper penalties for selfish, guerrilla protest tactics.” Forst said he was “alarmed” to learn that some judges were banning defendants from explaining the motivation behind their protest, including mentioning climate change. “It is very difficult to understand what could justify denying the jury the opportunity to hear the reason for the defendant’s action,” he wrote. The report referred to “highly concerning” information about “harsh” bail conditions for peaceful protesters awaiting trial — a period that could span up to two years — including wearing electronic ankle tags and curfews. “I seriously question the necessity and proportionality of such conditions for persons engaging in peaceful protest,” Forst wrote. He also said he was “distressed” to see how environmental defenders are “derided” by the media and political figures in the UK. It puts them at risk of “threats, abuse and even physical attacks,” he said. This “toxic discourse” can also be used by the government as justification for “adopting increasingly severe and draconian measures against environmental defenders,” he said. “In the course of my visit, I witnessed firsthand that this is precisely what is taking place in the UK right now,” he said, adding this had a “significant chilling effect” on civil society and fundamental rights to peaceful protest. “The right to protest is a fundamental part of our democracy,” the Home Office spokesperson told CNN, “but we must also protect the law-abiding majority’s right to go about their daily lives.” Climate protesters are increasingly undertaking high-profile and disruptive actions. But the fact they cause disruption does not mean they are not peaceful, Forst said. In January last year, one of the best known climate groups in the UK, Extinction Rebellion, announced it was pausing mass public disruption campaigns to focus on building more support. But other organizations have scaled up their protests. Last year, Just Stop Oil, for example, disrupted several major sporting events in England, including Wimbledon, the Ashes cricket test series and the World Snooker Championship, as well as a performance of the musical “Les Misérables.” This story has been updated with additional information."

An 84-year-old man died in Scotland on Sunday when a tree crushed the car he was traveling in. A 60-year-old man died on Sunday when his car collided with a fallen tree in Northern Ireland, and two people were killed in Ireland in separate storm-related road accidents on Sunday and early Monday morning. But while Jocelyn is expected to be less extreme, it comes as the UK is still grappling with the extensive damage Isha caused and as the ground in some places is already saturated from rainfall. “With the damage and clean up still underway, we could potentially see more impacts from Storm Jocelyn,” Willington said. Climate change, driven primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, is causing extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, to become more frequent and more intense. While there is no evidence of changes in the frequency or intensity of windstorms in the last few decades in the UK, future climate projections suggest that winter windstorms will increase slightly in number and intensity, Bentley said. “There is more confidence though, that the storms will be more impactful,” she added. “We are seeing more rainfall associated with these storms – a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, leads to heavier rainfall – climate projections indicate warmer, wetter winters in the future.” Climate change has also led to sea level rise, Bentley added, “so the impact of these storms is greater.”"

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","The West’s recent heat-driven megadroughts are unprecedented in at least 500 years, new research shows. “Hot drought” — when extreme drought and heat occur simultaneously — has increased in severity and frequency over the last century due to human-caused climate change, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. “What we’re seeing is that megadrought conditions are being amplified by anthropogenically driven (human caused) temperature increases,” said Karen King, lead author of the study and assistant professor in physical geography at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. Wednesday’s study builds on previous research, including one study that found the last two decades in the West have been the driest in 1,200 years, and the human-caused climate crisis made the yearslong dry spell 72% worse. Both studies used tree ring data, which can serve as scientific time capsules as they are affected by sunlight, rainfall and temperature, allowing researchers to reconstruct the past. While the previous study measured the length and width of the tree rings to gauge drought conditions, King’s research analyzed the density of the rings to measure how temperatures changed over time. “More dense rings mean warmer temperatures, and less dense rings mean cooler temperatures, typically,” King explained. She spent the last few years driving around the Pacific Northwest and the Interior Mountain West, including parts of Utah, Arizona and Colorado, to measure different tree species. After collecting tree ring data to analyze summer maximum temperatures across the region from 1553 to 2020 as well as existing historical drought records, King and her team were able to corroborate that the last two decades have been among the hottest years on record in at least five centuries across much of the western US. “It wasn’t that surprising, but when you put the two (studies) together, it paints a very cohesive picture that this anthropogenic influence on increased hot drought, particularly in the Southwest, is unprecedented over the last several centuries.” While droughts have frequented the West in the past, researchers say the effects are much more pronounced today due to alarmingly high temperatures. And the water supply has taken a large hit. According to the study, the regions most affected by hot droughts include the Great Plains, which contain the Ogallala aquifer — one of the country’s largest that supports nearly 25% of the region’s agriculture — and portions of the Colorado River Basin, which has been plagued by extreme drought and overuse in recent decades. Jonathan Overpeck, climate scientist and dean of the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability, told CNN the implications are huge if the climate crisis accelerates. “Water security and wildfire will become bigger problems until climate change is stopped,” said Overpeck, who was not involved with the study but has done research on hot droughts. “These impacts were predicted long ago and are now becoming clear.”"

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","The Biden administration is contemplating an overhaul of the way federal agencies approve massive natural gas export projects to allow for consideration what the climate impact of those facilities would be, according to an environmental advocacy source familiar with the plans. The overhaul would effectively pause the federal approval process for a massive and controversial gas export project known as CP2, the source said – a facility that is being proposed for the southwest Louisiana coast, as well as other natural gas projects that are pending federal approval. The administration’s potential change in posture on these facilities comes as President Joe Biden gears up for a tough reelection campaign, seeking to win the support of young, climate-minded voters. Environmental groups have recently turned their focus to the surge of new and planned fossil fuel infrastructure along the Gulf Coast – and the Biden administration’s role in approving it. The administration is considering a broad overhaul of how the Department of Energy makes so-called public interest determinations – a key step needed to approve liquified natural gas facilities. This could include updating how the administration determines climate impacts of these projects, modernizing and updating the climate impact considerations, and considering the full upstream and downstream life cycle impacts of these projects, the source said. The Energy Department, which is responsible for making public interest determinations as one step in the approval process, has never rejected a proposed natural gas project on these grounds. The White House declined to comment. The Department of Energy did not return CNN’s request for comment. The New York Times and Bloomberg also reported the administration is considering changes to how it approves natural gas projects. Natural gas is big business for the US fossil fuel industry, which has been exporting much of the product to other countries, particularly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Europe’s subsequent move away from Russian gas. US companies have stepped in to fill that gap, compressing or freezing gas at export terminals and shipping it across the ocean in enormous tankers. Biden is facing pressure on all sides as climate groups push back on the continued greenlighting of natural gas projects and the fossil fuel industry continues to invest in them. The CP2 project, which could export up to 20 million tons of natural gas a year, is the largest natural gas export facility proposed to date in the US and has been the subject of contentious debate. Shaylyn Hynes, a spokesperson for CP2’s owner Venture Global, said the reported plans from the Biden administration would “create uncertainty about whether our allies can rely on US LNG for their energy security” and would “shock the global energy market.” Environmental groups, who maintain the US is already producing and exporting enough gas to satisfy the energy needs of its foreign allies, cheered the plan. “That decision would be one we would get behind; these LNG export projects have been rubber stamped up to this point,” said Mahyar Sorour, the director of beyond fossil fuels policy at the Sierra Club. “We’re encouraged.” CNN Business’s Matt Egan contributed to this report."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/china/shipping-pollution-global-warming-climate-intl/index.html,The world successfully tackled a dangerous pollutant. But did it accidentally warm the planet in the process?,01-26-2024,                                                 Ships have been forced to cut the harmful air pollution they belch out. It’s a victory for human health but some scientists warn it might accelerate global warming.                                             ,"Laura Paddison, CNN","The huge cargo ships that criss-cross the world’s oceans sometimes leave “tracks” in their wake — long, wispy clouds that trail through the sky, lasting for a handful of days at most before disappearing. These ghost clouds look beautiful, but they are a visible sign of deadly air pollution. They form when tiny sulfur dioxide particles belched out from ships’ smokestacks interact with water vapor in the atmosphere, creating low-lying, highly reflective clouds. Ships’ sulfur pollution causes tens of thousands of premature deaths a year. But in what may seem a cruel twist — especially from an industry responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions — this type of pollution also helps cool the planet by brightening clouds and reflecting the sun’s energy away from the Earth. So, when in 2020 the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations body regulating shipping, slashed sulfur content permitted in ships’ fuel by 80%, it was a victory for human health. An estimated 30,000 premature deaths will now be avoided each year. But it was “a silver cloud with a dark lining,” said Michael Diamond, assistant professor at Florida State University’s Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science. The regulations ended a vast, accidental geoengineering project. Ship tracks reduced sharply, and with them, the cooling impact of this pollution. As global temperatures soar, it has left scientists﻿ trying to unpick whether these shipping regulations may be inadvertently fueling an alarming acceleration of global warming — a controversial hypothesis that has divided some experts. It’s a debate made more urgent by last year’s record-breaking heat. “Scientists are amazed at the outlier that 2023 was,” said Olaf Morgenstern, a scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand. The heat was especially pronounced in some parts of the oceans, where water temperatures in areas including the North Atlantic shot wildly off the charts. Scientists say the surge in global temperature was primarily driven by two factors: the impacts of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon that tends to have a global heating impact, combined with the backdrop of long-term global warming caused by burning fossil fuels. But some have speculated the heat spiked so abnormally high that other influences may also be at play. Theories include a lack of sunlight-reflecting dust from the Sahara, a change in wind patterns, and the January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga underwater volcano, which injected enough planet-warming water vapor into the atmosphere to fill 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. Of all of the theories, however, the impact of shipping regulations is swiftly becoming one of the most discussed. Scientists have long known that reducing this particle pollution﻿ would have a warming effect, but by how much “is where the controversy starts,” Morgenstern said. In November, the prominent climate scientist James Hansen co-authored a paper which argued the curtailing of shipping pollution was the main driver of an alarming acceleration in global warming that goes beyond what climate models have predicted. The IMO shipping regulations were “an unintentional scientific experiment,” Hansen told CNN. His research predicted global temperatures would breach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels in the 2020s and 2 degrees in the 2050s — a catastrophic level of warming that could trigger a slew of climate tipping points. But other scientists have urged caution, not least because the relationship between pollution particles and clouds is extremely complex. Unraveling it is “one of the biggest challenges in climate science,” Diamond said. Piers Forster, a professor of climate physics at Leeds University in the UK, said the reduction in shipping pollution is likely to have a very small warming influence. According to Forster’s calculations, the regulations will increase global warming by around 0.01 degrees Celsius, which could grow to about 0.05 degrees by 2050 — equivalent to around two additional years of human-caused emissions. However, he added, the uncertain effect of the pollution on clouds means there’s a possibility the warming impact could be much larger — an additional 0.1 or 0.2 degrees by 2050. Diamond, whose own work estimates the regulations will bring levels of warming over the next few decades of between 0.05 and 0.1 degrees, said this heat won’t be “a showstopper” but is important. Every fraction of a degree matters when the world is hurtling towards levels of warming to which even humans will increasingly struggle to adapt. Diamond, along with most of the other scientists CNN spoke to, doesn’t believe the decline in shipping pollution was a major factor in last year’s global heat, not least because there is usually a time lag before changes in the atmosphere are reflected in the Earth’s temperature. “But I think it could have mattered quite a bit more regionally,” he said. Shipping is unevenly distributed, with much of it concentrated between Europe, North America and Asia, meaning air pollution impacts are also likely to be skewed. In areas such as the North Atlantic, where temperatures soared several degrees above usual in 2023, Diamond said, “shipping is a decent explanation for part of why that was so warm.” There are only a few years of data so far, and it will take time for scientists to unravel the exact impact of the fall in shipping pollution. But it is clear that particle pollution from all sources, including burning fossil fuels, has had a cooling impact. Without it, the world would be about 0.4 degrees hotter, according to a 2021 report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And pollution decreases in the future could have a big impact. Annica Ekman, professor of meteorology at Stockholm University in Sweden, said her research has found that decreases in human-caused particle pollution between 2015 and 2050 could warm the planet as much as 0.5 degrees. But this is not an argument against cutting air pollution, Diamond said, it’s an argument for tackling it alongside reducing carbon emissions. The cooling impact of air pollution is far outweighed by the heating impact of burning fossil fuels. It’s when air pollution is tackled without also reducing carbon emissions, that “we can get into trouble,” Diamond said. That is what’s happening in this shipping industry, where huge container vessels are still propelled across the oceans by hundreds of millions of tons of fossil fuels. “We must not forget why the regulation exists,” Forster said. “It is there to save lives from air pollution.” While reducing this pollution will have a small warming impact, immediate action to reduce emissions will both slash the rate of global warming and improve air quality, he said. We are not “on some doomed trajectory,” he added."

This isn’t just a record for the day – it makes Friday DC’s warmest January day on record. Additionally, the toasty reading is now the earliest 80-degree calendar day for the city by nearly a month, crushing the record previously held by February 21, 2018. Washington Dulles International Airport also logged a new record for the history books when its weather station hit 79 degrees. This reading eclipsed the old daily and monthly high temperature records at the airport. A normal high temperature for the DC area in late January is 45 degrees. Highs near 80 are more common for the capital starting in late May. The eastern half of the country is experiencing a dramatic warm-up after a pattern change in the upper levels of the atmosphere that’s allowing tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico to push north. The weather whiplash comes after scientists announced earlier this month that 2023 was the warmest year on record, as planet-warming pollution continues to surge from fossil fuel use. DC’s record-breaking temperatures also come on the heels of its snowiest period in years. Last Friday, 3 to 6 inches of snow fell across the DC area, ending a record streak of more than 700 days without an inch of snow falling in a single day. The winter storm followed several days in which high temperatures struggled to approach 32 degrees. Low temperatures plummeted even further, reaching the single digits in some spots as recently as Tuesday morning. Friday’s warmth is fleeting, though. Temperatures will return to near-normal this weekend as rain also moves in; highs on Saturday will be in the mid-50s, and Sunday in the high 40s. CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward contributed to this report."

","Anna Cooban, CNN","The outlook for the global economy is brightening, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday as it upgraded its growth forecast for 2024. But it warned that the “surprisingly resilient” recovery from the pandemic, Russia’s war in Ukraine and the ensuing cost-of-living crisis could be jeopardised by attacks on container ships in the Red Sea, which risked scrambling supply chains and causing a spike in commodity prices. Inflation wasn’t beaten yet, it added. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF said that it expects the world’s economy to match last year’s growth of 3.1% in 2024 — 0.2 percentage points more than it predicted in October. It expects global growth in gross domestic product — a key measure of economic activity — to pick up slightly to 3.2% next year. “The clouds are beginning to part. The global economy begins the final descent toward a soft landing, with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up,” IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog accompanying the report. “But the pace of expansion remains slow, and turbulence may lie ahead.” The upward revision was driven by stronger-than-expected economic growth in the United States during the latter half of 2023, the IMF said, as well as robust growth in several emerging and developing economies. India, for example, is forecast to expand 6.5% this year and next, putting it far out in front of other major economies. The IMF also upgraded its 2024 view on China’s economy. It now sees growth of 4.6% this year, 0.4 percentage points up on its October forecast, owing partly to a better-than-expected performance in 2023 as well as increases in government spending. The world’s second-biggest economy has grappled with a cocktail of challenges in recent years, including an ongoing crisis in real estate and high youth unemployment. China’s economy grew 5.2% in 2023, beating government projections, but that still amounted to one of the country’s worst growth numbers in the past three decades. Despite the IMF’s upgrades, its projections for global growth for 2024 and 2025 are below the annual average of 3.8% clocked up over the first two decades of this century. That reflects, in part, the impact of high interest rates, the fund said. Higher official borrowing costs push up the cost of capital, which tends to dampen borrowing by households and businesses, reining in overall spending in the economy. Economists and investors have been hoping for a so-called “soft landing” — that is, a successful attempt by central banks to cool inflation without tipping their economies into recession. Global inflation is expected to average 5.8% this year, down from an estimated 6.8% in 2023, according to the IMF, reflecting a pullback in energy prices and a loosening of labor markets. Although inflation is entering its “final descent,” recent disruptions to the flow of global trade through the Red Sea have raised the risk of price spikes for certain commodities, the IMF said. Iran-backed Houthi rebels have ratcheted up attacks on ships in the Red Sea — a vital trading route — in retaliation for Israel’s war against Hamas. As a re﻿sult, several major container shipping companies have diverted their vessels away from the waterway, and some oil tankers have also been forced to take longer routes. The longer and costlier journeys have raised fears of a renewed rise in global inflation. “Continued attacks in the Red Sea — through which 11% of global trade flows — and the ongoing war in Ukraine risk generating fresh adverse supply shocks to the global recovery, with spikes in food, energy, and transportation costs,” the IMF said Tuesday. A spillover of the Israel-Hamas war into a wider conflict in the Middle East would threaten global growth, the fund added. The region accounts for about 35% and 14% of the world’s oil and gas exports respectively. For now, though, a rise in shipping costs since the escalation of the attacks in the Red Sea is not having a “major macroeconomic impact,” Gourinchas told journalists Tuesday. “As of now, the impact that we see on inflation in, let’s say, European economies, is fairly modest,” he said. “Even though the increase in shipping costs is substantial, this hasn’t really translated into an overall increase, of a sizable nature, in inflation.” The IMF also warned that core inflation could still prove problematic, particularly if the cost of services keeps rising and upward pressure on wages persists. Indebted governments could be forced to cut spending or raise taxes, if financial markets become less convinced that interest rate cuts are imminent."

","Chris Lau, CNN","Heavy snow and rain is forecast to hit central and eastern China in the coming days, threatening travel plans for hundreds of millions of Chinese workers heading home for the Lunar New Year. Also known as the Spring Festival, the Lunar New Year holiday traditionally sees the nation pause as migrant workers pile onto trains, planes and buses to go home to see their family. Forecasters warn the extreme winter weather could cause mass disruption, with state broadcaster CCTV predicting the “most complex weather” since early 2008, when heavy snow affected more than 67 million people. However, Xu Jun, chief forecaster from the Central Meteorological Observatory, told CCTV the forecast snowfall won’t be as heavy or widespread as that experienced around the holiday season 16 years ago. “Its extreme nature comes from the fact that it is a rare weather event with great intensity and impacts,” she said. At least 10 provinces - including Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Liaoning and Hubei - are anticipating blizzards until the start of next week, just days before the Lunar New Year begins next Saturday, CCTV said, citing China’s Central Meteorological Observatory. “The rain and snow overlap with the peak period of Spring Festival travel. This has posed risks to safe (travel) and brought inconvenience to the transportation,” weather expert Wang Lijuan, from China Meteorological Administration, told CCTV. The Central Meteorological Observatory has already issued a blizzard warning for some of the affected region, with snow running up to 5 centimeters (nearly 2 inches) thick in some areas, according to its Chinese social media account. In Zhengzhou, a central eastern city, authorities canceled some high-speed train services and said they would order trains to operate at reduced speed due to the blizzards and rain. At least five provinces - including Henan, Hubei and Anhui - will be hit by freezing rain, CCTV reported, which is likely to further complicate travels. The weather phenomenon refers to raindrops being frozen into ice droplets upon contact with surfaces after they hit the ground, which could damage electricity cables and make roads slippery, China Meteorological Administration warned in a Weibo post, urging drivers to slow down. Xu, from the Central Meteorological Observatory, told CCTV freezing rain could affect many provinces over an area as wide as 43,000 square kilometers (16,600 square miles). Blizzards struck many parts of China in early 2008, damaging power lines and blocking highways and railways, leaving hundreds of thousands of travelers stranded. At least 24 people died while 827,000 people were evacuated in 14  provinces. China, like many other parts of the world, has been hit by extreme weather in recent years. Its lowest ever temperature was recorded last January, when Jintao town in Mohe, northeastern Heilongjiang province, dropped to -53° C. Last summer, China recorded its hottest year on record and was also hit by the heaviest rainfall in decades, causing flooding and billions of dollars in damage."

","Ariel Edwards-Levy, CNN","The public’s long-held pessimism about the economy shows signs of easing since last year, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds. But even with the uptick, many Americans’ views of the economy – and the nation as a whole – remain bleak. Only 35% of Americans say that things in the country today are going well, but that’s an improvement from the 28% who felt positively about the state of affairs last fall. And while just 26% of Americans say they feel the economy is starting to recover from the problems it faced in the past few years, that’s also up from 20% last summer and 17% in December 2022. Overall, 26% of Americans currently say that economic conditions have stabilized, and 48% say they believe the economy remains in a downturn. Yet, the US economy has been growing strongly since 2020, and the jobs report released Friday showed a stunning gain of 353,000 jobs last month, a stronger-than expected kickoff for 2024. Of those who think the economy is recovering, nearly three-quarters (73%) say President Joe Biden’s economic policies have helped to improve things. An even broader 83% of those who say the economy is continuing to devolve say his policies have instead made things worse. Views of the nation’s economic trajectory are inflected by partisanship, with the uptick in sentiment coming mainly among Democrats (49% now say the economy is recovering, up 10 percentage points from July) and independents (24%, up 7 points). Just 6% of Republicans say they see a recovery beginning, nearly unchanged from last summer. But within the Democratic Party, there’s also a significant age divide, with most younger Democrats less likely to see the economy on the upswing. About one-third of Democrats younger than 45 (35%) say that the economy is starting to recover, compared with 63% of those 45 and older. And more broadly, a narrow majority of Democratic adults younger than 45 (54%) say that things in the country are going badly, a view shared by only about one-quarter of their older counterparts (22%). Recent Commerce Department numbers show the US economy remaining robust, CNN reported in January, with the first jobs report for 2024 expected to look strong. When Americans who say the economy remains in a downturn were asked to explain why they feel that way, most cite inflation and the cost of living generally (50%) or the price of specific items like food (9%) or housing (7%), with many pointing to their own financial situations. Another 13% who feel the economy is still in decline cite Biden or Democratic policies, and 9% name wages and income. Fewer mention jobs, gas prices or the stock market. “Everything that matters in life is continuing to get more expensive, regardless of what the inflation index says,” wrote one Republican from Georgia who responded to the poll. “Everything is still expensive and many people are struggling with that,” said a Republican-leaning independent from Louisiana. “Consumer debt is way up. Wall Street is doing well but that doesn’t help the average worker.” Overall, 42% of all Americans say their financial situation is worse than it was a year ago, down from 49% who felt that way in December of 2022 when the nation’s inflation rate was nearly double what it is today. In the new poll, 37% say they’re doing about the same as a year ago, and 20% that they’re now doing better. A 55% majority of Americans overall say they feel Biden’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, while just 26% believe his policies have improved conditions and another 19% say they’ve had no effect – numbers that are nearly unchanged from last summer. A near-universal 91% of Republicans say that Biden’s policies have worsened the economy, while a more modest 55% majority of Democrats say that his policies have improved things. Biden’s approval rating for handling the economy, which hasn’t broken the 40% mark since December 2021, currently stands at 37% among the full public. Biden’s lowest issue approval rating in the poll comes on his handling of immigration, with just 30% of Americans approving. That number reflects heightened concerns about the state of affairs at the US-Mexico border. Asked whether or not the current situation at the border is a crisis, 79% of Americans – including majorities across party lines – say that it is, matching the elevated level of concern last seen in April 2021. And the poll also finds a rise in hardline immigration sentiments. In multiple polls taken during Donald Trump’s presidency, the overwhelming majority of Americans said they favored developing a plan to allow some undocumented immigrants living in the US to become legal residents; in 2019, 15% or fewer said that the government should instead make it a priority to deport all people living in the US illegally. The share favoring mass deportations, while still a minority, has now roughly doubled to 31%. A 54% majority of Republicans now say the US should prioritize deportation, up from 32% who felt that way in 2019. Americans give Biden a 41% approval rating for his handling of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while 34% approve of his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. That disparity highlights the president’s particular weakness with his base on issues relating to Israel. While most Democrats give him positive ratings on Ukraine (72% approve), only about half (51%) say they approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war; among Democrats younger than 45, that falls to just 35%. Overall, a slim plurality (37%) of Americans say that the US is doing about the right amount to help Israel in its war with Hamas, while 33% say it’s doing too much and 29% that the US is doing too little. The public is closely split between saying the US is doing too much (35%) or about the right amount (34%) to help Ukraine in its war with Russia, with 30% saying the US is doing too little to assist there. Partisan views of the two conflicts differ sharply. Republicans are roughly twice as likely as Democrats (40% to 19%) to say that the US is doing too little to help Israel. By contrast, Democrats are about twice as likely as Republicans (41% to 21%) to say that the US isn’t doing enough to help Ukraine. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from January 25-30 among a random national sample of 1,212 adults drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer.

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Winter has been more wet and warm than white in the Northeast, with no major snowstorms to speak of in what’s been a two year wait for a big snow event. Major cities along the region’s I-95 corridor are running deficits on their typical winter snowfall despite a few batches of modest snow that ended record long snowless streaks. But winter isn’t over yet, despite that famous groundhog’s prediction, and February has historically proven to be its best chance for blockbuster snowstorms. Mix in El Niño’s influence, and even March could hold snowy surprises if the right conditions align. Winter did not get off to a promising start. December was the second-warmest on record across eight Northeast states, according to data from NOAA. It was one of the 10-warmest Decembers for several other states, including parts of the mid-Atlantic. January continued the trend and was warmer than average for every major city in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, despite a short-lived blast of frigid air mid-month. It’s part of a larger trend. Winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the US and snowfall is declining around the globe as temperatures rise because of human-caused climate change. More snow has fallen in major cities so far than in recent lackluster winters, despite the warmth – but the bar is incredibly low. Most cities’ seasonal snowfall totals are still pacing behind average. New York City’s snowfall total this season is just over 2 inches even after multiple storms. This is well short of the 13.7 inches the city typically sees by January 31. The problem is major snowstorms have eluded the region. Philadelphia hasn’t had a snowstorm unload 6 inches or more in a day since December 2020. It’s been more than two years since the last time such a heavy snowfall event hit New York City and Washington, DC. February could finally bring a big snow if the right conditions align. Trace a path along I-95 from Richmond, Virginia, to Portland, Maine, and nearly every city along and east of the busy roadway typically gets more snow in February than any other month. This is because ocean temperatures close to the coast usually cool off by February, allowing coastal storms – like nor’easters – to tap into colder air and produce more snow, Paul Fitzsimmons, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey, told CNN. Global ocean temperatures are still at record-warm levels, but sea surface temperatures along much of the immediate Atlantic coast have chilled considerably compared to early January, when the Northeast’s first snowstorm arrived and produced little to no snow along I-95. Ocean temperatures are typically coldest in the late winter because water loses its heat built up during the warm season much slower than land does, Fitzsimmons explained. As a result, more impactful Northeast snowstorms occur in February than any other month, according to a scale used to rank snowstorms from the National Centers for Environmental Information. January is a close second, with March third and December fourth. In one of the most recent examples, a Category 3 “major” storm on the NCEI scale dumped over a foot of snow in New York City’s Central Park right at the start of February 2021. El Niño – a natural phenomenon in the tropical Pacific that influences weather around the globe – could also provide a boost for snow along the I-95 corridor in February. El Niño winters favor a storm track along the southern tier of the US, increasing the chances for storms to push off the coast and become potent, snowy nor’easters. Nor’easters can also get “juiced up” by abundant tropical moisture and deliver “two to three big snowstorms” on average during an El Niño winter, Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, previously told CNN. Not all hope is lost if February doesn’t produce a big snowstorm. Opportunities for snow persist into March, but really plummet in April. Nor’easters continue to be a threat in March, as evidenced by an extraordinary series of four storms that unfolded in 2018. The four nor’easters slammed the Northeast in under four weeks, earning them the moniker of “four’easter.” These storms brought considerable coastal flooding, damaging winds and heavy snow to much of the Northeast that March. At least 10 to 20 inches of snow fell across parts of every state in the region, with 20 to 30 inches in portions of upstate New York and New England. Blockbuster snowstorms are not guaranteed, especially with so much warmth, but these next few weeks may be the last real chance this winter. Average snowfall amounts become quite abysmal in April. New York City, Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey, all average 0.5 inches of snow or less for the month."

But there are some science-based links between plants, animals and incoming weather.                                             ","Jackie Wattles, CNN","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Punxatawney Phil, the central character of the annual rite of winter known as Groundhog’s Day, isn’t great at his job. His predictions are wrong more often than they are right. On Friday, the divining marmot did not see his shadow, indicating an early spring. Though, technically speaking, winter will end on the spring equinox, which falls on the evening of March 19. But the groundhog is just one of numerous animals that, according to folklore, possess an uncanny ability to forecast the weather, including cows that are said to lie down before early rain and woolly bear caterpillars that are supposedly decorated with less color before a frigid winter. Most of these associations are unmoored from modern science — but there is an occasional hint of documented fact among the myths. Phenology is the study of how seasonal events in the lives of plants and animals shift according to the weather and climate, such as how fish or migratory birds respond to the temperature of water and air. (The field of study can be practiced as a hard science, for the record, and is entirely distinct from the pseudoscientific “phrenology.”) The USA National Phenology Network tracks when ecological markers of spring arrive across the United States — and the season is already in bloom in certain locations on the east and west coasts. Theresa Crimmins, the director of the USA National Phenology Network, said that while Punxatawney Phil is not a reliable predictor of spring’s arrival, phenology does offer scientific backing for other seemingly superstitious axioms about the natural world. “People have been observing (environmental conditions) for many millennia, for basically as long as humans have been around,” Crimmins said. “So (a lot of these adages) actually work because they are, in a sense, capturing those relationships between the environmental conditions and plant response.” But while folklore often supposes animal behavior portends future weather events, in reality, flora and fauna react to weather and climate. The roots of Groundhog Day lie in traditions that were likely imported to the United States from Germany, where the winter-forecasting animal was a badger rather than a groundhog. However, numerous tried-and-true proverbs about the natural world come from Native American populations. “One example is planting corn when oak leaves are the size of a squirrel’s ear,” notes an article on phenology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “You know that planting corn has nothing to do with oak leaves or squirrels. However, Native Americans made the observation centuries ago that the soil was warm enough to prevent seeds from rotting, yet it was still early enough to reap a suitable harvest if corn was planted at this time.” Crimmins points out that there are plenty of other predictors for coming ecological events spelled out in the leaves, berries and flowers of plants. For example, the shadblow serviceberry is a small tree that is native to parts of eastern North America, and it’s believed that its name came from the fact that it bears flowers at the same time of year that shad fish begin their river migration. The Lenape and other Native American populations made note of the phenomenon long ago and prepared to fish when the plant began to bloom. The Old Farmer’s Almanac  has aggregated a couple dozen adages about insects, animals and their ability to predict weather patterns. Some of the claims are dubious. Dogs eating grass, for example, is likely a far less accurate predictor of rain than a meteorologist’s weather report. But there is research out there that suggests some animals may possess an innate sense that helps them detect when a disaster is on the way. Golden-winged warblers, for example, evacuated an area of Tennessee more than 24 hours before a devastating string of tornadoes hit the area, according to a December 2014 study published in the journal Current Biology. The study authors predicted the migrant birds listened to infrasound — sound at frequencies too low for humans to hear — associated with the storms and heeded it as a warning sign. Researchers in Germany also looked into whether various species of animals could detect an oncoming earthquake. The scientists found that, collectively, animals including cows, sheep and dogs exhibited more activity before an earthquake up to 20 hours in advance, according to a report from Germany’s Max Planck Society, a nonprofit association of research institutes. There is also truth to the notion that crickets can act as nature’s thermometer. The insects are ectotherms, meaning their body temperature changes with that of their surrounding environment — and they routinely chirp faster in warmer weather. According to Dolbear’s Law, a formula describing this association between crickets and weather, “you can count the number of chirps per 15 seconds, add 40, and that will give you the temperature in Fahrenheit,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notes. Frogs also deliver unique calls when it’s about to rain. “Many twentieth-century herpetologists have confirmed and clarified the traditional observation that various species of frogs sometimes utter a distinctive vocalization, a ‘rain call,’ a short time before wet weather,” said Dr. Gordon Miller, a professor emeritus of environmental studies at Seattle University, via email. The calls “are perhaps triggered by a rise in humidity prior to precipitation,” Miller said. Other tropes about animals’ ability to predict seasonal conditions, however, are wrong. The woolly bear — a species of caterpillar, also called the woolly worm — famously is thought to forecast the severity of the impending winter with its colored bands. More black coloring on the insect supposedly indicates harsher conditions on the way. But in reality, the “caterpillar’s coloring is based on how long (the) caterpillar has been feeding, its age, and species,” according to the National Weather Service. “The better the growing season is the bigger it will grow. This results in narrower red-orange bands in its middle. Thus, the width of the banding is an indicator of the current or past season’s growth rather than an indicator of the severity of the upcoming winter.” Unusual animal behavior can also be a reaction to a changing climate, Crimmins emphasized. And often not in good ways. The climate crisis and human development are causing all sorts of ecological problems, Crimmins noted. Bears, for example, are entering hibernation later and arising earlier because of the warmer weather. That can lead to more human-bear interactions  as bears search for food, and there is concern about how shorter hibernation periods are affecting bear pregnancies. Miller added that, while frogs may be able to foretell incoming rainfall, “with so many amphibian species continuing to decline due to various environmental and climatic factors, perhaps their most clarion call to us today, as Rachel Carson noted of birds in 1962, is their diminishing chorus and growing silence.”"

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Using sponges collected off the coast of Puerto Rico in the eastern Caribbean, scientists have calculated 300 years of ocean temperatures and concluded the world has already overshot one crucial global warming limit and is speeding toward another. These findings, published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, are alarming but also controversial. Other scientists say the study contains too many uncertainties and limitations to draw such firm conclusions and could end up confusing public understanding of climate change. Sponges — which grow slowly, layer by layer — can act like data time capsules, allowing a glimpse into what the ocean was like hundreds of years ago, long before the existence of modern data. Using samples from sclerosponges, which live for centuries, the team of international scientists was able to calculate ocean surface temperatures going back 300 years. They found human-caused warming may have started earlier than currently assumed and, as a result, global average temperature may have already warmed more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Researchers say the results also suggest global temperature could overshoot 2 degrees of warming by the end of the decade. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries pledged to restrict global warming to less than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, with an ambition to limit it to 1.5 degrees. The pre-industrial era — or the state of the climate before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels and warming the planet — is commonly defined as 1850-1900. The study authors argue their findings suggest the pre-industrial era should be pushed further back to between the 1700s and 1860. Changing that baseline would mean the world has already warmed at least 1.7 degrees (scientists say long-term global warming currently stands at between 1.2 to 1.3 degrees). “The big picture is that global warming, and the urgent need for emission reductions to minimize the risk of dangerous climate change, has been brought forward by at least a decade,” Malcolm McCulloch, lead author of the study and marine geochemist at the University of Western Australia, said at a news briefing. “So, this is a major change to thinking about global warming.” However, several climate scientists have questioned the study’s findings, especially using one type of sponge from one location in the Caribbean to represent global temperatures. Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist, said estimating global average temperature requires data from as many locations as possible, as climate varies across the planet. “Claims that records from a single record can confidently define the global mean warming since the pre-industrial are probably overreaching,” he said in a statement. Gabi Hegerl, a professor of climate system science at the University of Edinburgh, said the study was “a nice new record that illustrates how temperatures in the Caribbean started to rise over the industrial period.” But, she added in a statement, “the interpretation in terms of global warming goals overstretches it.” Some went further. Yadvinder Malhi, professor of ecosystem science at the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, said the way the findings have been communicated were “flawed” and have “the potential to add unnecessary confusion to public debate on climate change.” A co-author of the study defended its robustness and argued that temperature changes in the part of the Caribbean the sponges came from have always mimicked changes around the globe. “It’s probably one of the best areas if you’re trying to figure out global averaging on the Earth,” said Amos Winter, a professor of geology at Indiana State University. Ocean temperatures in the region are predominantly affected by planet-heating pollution, rather than natural climate variability like El Niño, he said. Whatever the baseline for measuring global warming, what remains clear, experts say, is that the impacts will worsen with every fraction of a degree of warming. “It’s exciting to see new research that allows us to peek centuries in the past,” said Joeri Rogelj, director of research at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, in a statement. But, he added, “relabeling the warming that has occurred until today by using a different starting point does not change the impacts we are seeing today, or the impacts we are aiming to avoid.” Winter hopes the study will function as a call to action. “Hopefully this will help change our viewpoints of what is happening in the globe, make us act now, and not wait for some disaster to happen for us to change our habits.”"

","Taylor Ward, CNN","As temperatures rise and the world’s oceans store more potential fuel for storms, a new study proposes adapting the scale that measures the intensity of hurricanes to account for stronger storms. The Saffir-Simpson scale currently goes from Category 1 to 5; the study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, suggests adding a Category 6. A Category 5 hurricane is a storm that has sustained winds of 157 mph or greater. The new scale would cap Category 5 storms at 192 mph and anything above 192 mph would become a Category 6 hurricane. The study’s authors – Jim Kossin, a distinguished science advisor at the First Street Foundation, and Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory – argue as climate change leads to soaring ocean temperatures, the potential wind intensity of hurricanes – also known as tropical cyclones or typhoons in oceans outside the Atlantic and East Pacific – is increasing. In fact, of the 197 tropical cyclones worldwide that reached Category 5 status between 1980 and 2021, five exceeded the hypothetical Category 6 threshold, the study found. All five occurred since 2013, including 2015’s Hurricane Patricia, which hit Mexico, and Super Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated the Philippines in 2013. But the idea of adding a Category 6 to the scale is nothing new: It’s been discussed for years. The Saffir-Simpson scale, which has been around since the early 1970s, also has limitations in that it is only a wind scale and does not include the impacts of storm surge and rain-induced flooding, which can be the most deadly and damage-causing aspects of landfalling storms. As the planet warms, these impacts of hurricanes are becoming more dangerous. Sea level rise of only a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference in how far inland storm surge can travel, and a warmer climate also means there will be more water vapor available in the atmosphere to potentially fall as rain."

But can it deliver?,02/06/2024,"                                                 The Commission published one of the world’s most ambitious goals to slash planet-heating pollution, but protesting farmers and elections could threaten its success.                                             ","Angela Dewan, CNN","The European Commission announced one of the world’s most ambitious goals to slash planet-heating pollution on Tuesday, but protesting farmers and upcoming elections could threaten its success, analysts say. The Commission — which is part of the European Union’s executive government — is backing a 90% cut in carbon emissions by 2040, from 1990 levels, taking a stance that is likely to set a benchmark for developed nations around the world. EU Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra made the announcement in parliament, and a roadmap outlining how to reach the target was published by the Commission shortly after, touching on the future of fossil fuels, transportation and industry. The announcement will kick off months of talks that could take up to a year before the European Parliament rubber stamps the target. The Commission removed a separate target for climate action in the agricultural sector that had appeared in an earlier draft, obtained by CNN. It is a concession to European farmers who have been protesting for weeks, some of whom had explicitly rallied against climate policies they consider a threat to their livelihoods. The earlier draft had called for a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, compared to 2015 levels. Questions are now being raised over whether the EU can deliver, and not only because of its farmers. The 27-nation bloc already has a 55% emissions reduction target for 2030, but the Commission warned in December that member states were off track to reach that goal. While there is fairly broad support for the new 90% target — which was the minimum recommended by the EU’s scientific advisory body — deliberations on how to achieve it may take a radical turn in June, when the EU holds elections for the European Parliament, the bloc’s legislative body. The European Greens — a faction of environmentally conscious lawmakers from several countries — are expecting big losses in the vote, after making sweeping gains in the 2019 election. Conservative and far-right parties are forecast to snap up many of those lost seats, putting the EU’s more ambitious climate goals at risk. A new-look parliament might choose to keep the 90% goal, said Manon Dufour, executive director of the climate think tank E3G’s Brussels office, but there will likely be sticking points over issues like agriculture and when to ban the sale of combustion engine cars. “This might be a bit of a new world that we are entering, where the parliament might not be the most progressive institution, which has been the status quo until now,” Dufour told CNN. “Of course, the political makeup of the European Parliament will have an impact on European action across the board, whether it’s on markets, or foreign policy, or climate.” One of the biggest changes that a more conservative EU parliament might see is more resistance to increased regulation, Dufour said, particularly outright bans. “We’re looking at a European Parliament that is more in favor of regulatory freedom for member states,” Dufour said. “So that could also impact some of the policies going forward, being more skeptical of environmental policies and climate policies.” Already, the EU’s center-right alliance, the European People’s Party (EPP), is seeking to roll back key elements of the EU’s broader Green Deal, such as a ban on the sale of combustion engine cars by 2035, aimed at phasing in electric vehicles more widely. The EPP is pitching itself as the champion of farmers ahead of the June election and has been vocal in its opposition to the EU’s environmental policies in agriculture. Bas Eickhout, who was elected to co-lead the European Greens alliance in parliament at the weekend, accepts the Greens are likely to lose seats in June, and that may weaken EU climate action. “It’s clear that we will be challenged this campaign,” said Eickhout, who is also a Dutch politician. In 2019, green issues were a priority for many voters, he said. “It was a kind of climate election,” he told CNN. The Greens had been successful in achieving a strong climate agenda through the EU parliament, he added. “And now there’s a bit of a pushback on it.” Eickhout said that the EU’s climate program had, at times, failed to be inclusive of everyday Europeans, including farmers. “It’s clear that there needs to be a more sustainable model for agriculture, but we also understand why farmers feel how they [do] with their backs against the wall,” Eickhout said. “If you say you have to change your entire agriculture system, of course you get resistance. I would also resist, especially if I’m not even sure I can make a living out of it now.” The Greens will campaign in the upcoming elections for even more ambitious climate targets, including reaching net zero by 2040, 10 years before the current goal. But it will also seek to include more social policy in the Green Deal, the EU’s overarching climate plan. Linda Kalcher, executive director of the Brussel-based climate think tank Strategic Perspectives, is more optimistic. She said new conservative or even far-right lawmakers may also back some ambitious climate policies because so many make sense in terms of economics and security, as well. Kalcher said that recent years had shown that economics and energy security were boosting the green transition, rather than climate policy alone. “We clearly saw that the recovery has been green because that was the best opportunity to really make sectors thrive and create additional jobs in response to the pandemic. We also saw that in response to the war in Ukraine, leaders were increasing renewable energy targets and energy efficiency targets.”"

What’s in store for the coming months",02/08/2024,"                                                 The current El Niño is now one of the strongest on record, new data shows, catapulting it into rare “super El Niño” territory, but forecasters believe that La Niña is likely to develop in the coming months.                                             ","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","The current El Niño is now one of the strongest on record, new data shows, catapulting it into rare “super El Niño” territory, but forecasters believe that La Niña is likely to develop in the coming months. One of the main ways scientists determine whether El Niño is present, and a key indicator of its strength, is through ocean surface temperatures. And from November to January, the temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean where El Niño originates was 2 degrees Celsius warmer than normal, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction center – a threshold that has only been breached six times on record. It means a very strong El Niño is ongoing. But this so-called super El Niño’s strength won’t last long – it has reached its peak strength and is headed on a downward trend, said Michelle L’Heureux, a climate scientist with the Climate Prediction Center. “We’re slightly past peak [strength] at this point,” L’Heureux told CNN. Forecasters believe the switch could get totally flipped to La Niña – cooler than average conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific – as soon as summer, but more likely by fall, and issued a La Niña watch on Thursday. El Niño influences weather around the globe, so its strength and demise will continue to have an impact on the weather we experience in the coming months. The stronger an El Niño gets, the more likely it is to influence the global weather over time. But its impact is measured on a seasonal timescale, and not in terms of individual weather events, L’Heureux explained. El Niños have hallmark seasonal signs, particularly on winter in the US. A warmer-than-average winter with less snow across the northern tier of the US is one of these signs. This exact scenario is unfolding this winter. Multiple states in the region experienced the warmest-ever December and an overall toasty January with paltry amounts of snow – a trend that’s continuing into February. El Niño also manifests as a wetter-than-average winter for the southern tier of the US as it often points the storm-steering jet stream south. A serious drought in parts of the South has largely been wiped out this winter by repeated bouts of rain from storm systems. And California was just deluged by back-to-back potent atmospheric river-fueled storms that unloaded record rainfall and hundreds of mudslides. El Niño has been known to enhance atmospheric river events on the West Coast. “It’s difficult to attribute any single weather system or series of them to El Niño. With that said, it seems probable that there were some links to El Niño [with California’s storms],” L’Heureux noted. The additional source of heat from warmer water in the eastern Pacific Ocean can be especially impactful to weather patterns in the western portions of both Americas that border the Pacific. The recent disastrous, deadly fires in Chile reflect the El Niño connection. The pattern is linked to decreased precipitation in the northern part of the country which contributed to extensive drought that left areas tinder-dry. El Niño has also left its fingerprints on temperature and precipitation patterns in several other continents, including South America, Africa, Australia and parts of Asia, according to L’Heureux. But L’Heureux is careful to caution that not every extreme weather event can be attributed directly to El Niño in a warming world. “El Niño impacts don’t occur in isolation anymore. There’s certainly a climate change component,” L’Heureux said. Human-caused climate change is driving up global temperatures, leading to more frequent and intense extreme weather events. A La Niña watch is now in effect, meaning conditions are favorable for a La Niña to form within the next six months, according to a forecast released by the CPC Thursday. The center is eyeing this transition to unfold during the summer months, with La Niña conditions increasingly likely to be in effect through the fall. There is a 55% chance of La Niña to develop from June to August and a 77% chance from September to November, according to L’Heureux and the forecast. This abrupt pattern flip is not unprecedented. Historically, strong El Niños are followed by La Niña conditions about 60% of the time, L’Heureux said. Depending on when – or even if – La Niña materializes, this large-scale pattern flip could have significant implications for how the rest of the year’s weather plays out. La Niñas often produce the opposite weather patterns as El Niño, including a more active Atlantic hurricane season. La Niña conditions were in place for a portion of the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record: 2020. A quicker switch to La Niña could mean more of an impact on the upcoming hurricane season, which begins in June and typically peaks in September – particularly if oceans stay exceptionally warm. Last year’s Atlantic hurricane season was unusually active amid record warm oceans, despite attempts by El Niño to tamp down activity. CNN’s Rachel Ramirez and Brandon Miller contributed to this report"

","Angela Dewan, CNN","Global warming surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius over the past 12 months for the first time on record, new data shows, breaching a critical threshold that, if it continues, will push the limits of life on Earth to adapt. The past year was 1.52 degrees hotter on average than temperatures before industrialization, according to data from Copernicus, the European Union’s climate and weather monitoring service. That 12-month average was boosted by the hottest January on record, which was 1.66 degrees warmer than the average January temperature in pre-industrial times. Keeping global warming below 2 degrees, but preferably 1.5, was the centerpiece goal of the Paris Agreement, which most of the world’s nations signed onto in 2015. Scientists are more concerned with ﻿multi-year warming above these thresholds, but the 12-month record shows the world is fast approaching the Paris Agreement’s limits. Matt Patterson, a postdoctoral research assistant in atmospheric physics at the University of Oxford, said the record was a “significant milestone,” but didn’t mean the Paris Agreement had failed. “However, exceeding 1.5C in one year underlines the rapidly shrinking window of time humanity has to make deep emissions cuts and avoid dangerous climate change.” Heat records on land and sea have tumbled over the past year. The last eight months in a row have been the hottest such months on record, Copernicus said, while 2023 was the hottest calendar year. The average global sea surface temperature for January was also the hottest on record for that month by a large margin: 0.26 degrees warmer than the previous record, set in 2016. “2024 starts with another record-breaking month – not only is it the warmest January on record but we have also just experienced a 12-month period of more than 1.5°C above the pre-industrial reference period,” Copernicus Deputy Director Samantha Burgess said in a statement. “Rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are the only way to stop global temperatures increasing.” The climate crisis is driven primarily from humans burning coal, oil and gas for energy. El Niño, a natural climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean, has also boosted temperatures in much of the world in recent months. Extreme weather events already made more frequent and severe by long-term global warming are now being supercharged by El Niño, scientists say. The combination of the two has proved particularly destructive. More than 160 wildfires that spread over an area of Chile this week have killed more than 120 people and reduced entire neighborhoods to ashes, making them the deadliest blazes in the country’s recent history. The twin threat also supercharged the California storms this week, scientists said, enhancing rainfall and boosting the storm’s destructive power."

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet holds enough water to raise sea levels by about 5 meters – more than 16 feet — which would cause devastating flooding in coastal towns and cities around the world. The study is “an excellent piece of detective work” about a major part of the Antarctic ice sheet, said Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. The key message is “the amount of ice stored in Antarctica can change very quickly — at a pace that would be hard to deal with for many coastal cities,” he told CNN. Ice cores are historical archives of the Earth’s atmosphere. Made up of layers of ice that formed as snow fell and compacted over thousands of years, they contain bubbles of ancient air as well as contaminants that provide a record of environmental changes over millennia. The ice core analyzed in the study was drilled from Skytrain Ice Rise located at the edge of the ice sheet, near the point where the ice starts to float and become part of the Ronne Ice Shelf. Scientists extracted it in 2019, in a painstaking process that involved drilling constantly for 40 days, pulling up a thin cylinder of ice a few feet at a time. They then cut the core into sections, packed them in insulated boxes kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius, and sent them to the UK via plane then ship. Once in the UK, the scientists measured the ice core’s water isotopes, which provide information on temperature in the past. Warmer temperatures indicate lower-lying ice — think of it like a mountain, Wolff said, the higher up you go the colder it gets. They also measured the pressure of trapped air bubbles in the ice. Lower-lying and thinner ice contains higher pressure air bubbles. It was a surprise when the data revealed just how quickly the ice had thinned at the end of the last Ice Age, Wolff said. “We actually spent a lot of time checking that we hadn’t made a mistake with the analysis.” The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is particularly vulnerable to climate change, because the land under it is below sea level and slopes downward. When warm water gets underneath, it can melt very fast. “It can have a runaway process, and that’s evidently what happened 8,000 years ago,” Wolff said. What makes the findings so alarming, said Isobel Rowell, an ice core scientist at the British Antarctic Survey and a study co-author, is that once that runaway happens “there’s really very little, if anything, that we can do to stop it,” she told CNN. The crucial thing “is not to test it too far,” Wolff said, and that means tackling climate change. “We can avoid these tipping points still,” he said. The new data will help improve the accuracy of the models scientists use to predict how the ice sheet will respond to future global heating, the report says. David Thornalley, an ocean and climate scientist at University College London, said the study’s data was “striking.” He cautioned that as the study looked at a period 8,000 years ago, when climate conditions were different, the results aren’t a direct example of what could happen today. But, he added, they are still able to offer an “insight into the way that ice sheets can collapse.” The study comes as scientists continue to sound the alarm about what is happening to the Earth’s most isolated continent. For example, the Thwaites Glacier, also in West Antarctica, is melting rapidly. A 2022 study said the Thwaites — dubbed the Doomsday Glacier for the catastrophic impact its collapse would have on sea level rise — was hanging on “by its fingernails” as the planet warms. This new study adds to these concerns, Scambos said. “(It) shows that the very same processes we are seeing just beginning now, in areas like Thwaites Glacier, have played out before in similar areas of Antarctica and indeed, the pace of ice loss was equal to our worst fears about a runaway ice loss.”"

The rocket’s booster successfully landed back on Earth about 10 minutes after launch. Just over half an hour after liftoff, the team confirmed that the spacecraft’s solar arrays deployed and it was receiving power. The launch, initially set for Tuesday morning, was delayed twice due to high winds and cumulus clouds. But the weather conditions were more than 95% favorable for launch Thursday morning. Scientists began envisioning a way to better understand how oceanic and atmospheric processes shape the planet about 20 years ago, said Jeremy Werdell, PACE project scientist. The mission will shed light on how aerosols and clouds as well as phytoplankton in the ocean serve as indicators for ocean health and global warming. The three instruments aboard PACE, including two polarimeters and one camera, will capture a rainbow of data across different wavelengths of light that “allows us to see things we’ve never been able to see before,” said Karen St. Germain, director of NASA’s Earth Science Division. “What we’re doing here with PACE is really the search for the microscopic, mostly invisible universe in the sea and the sky, and in some degrees, on land, too,” Werdell said. Although designed as a three-year mission, PACE has enough fuel to continue orbiting and studying Earth for up to 10 years. The spacecraft will join a fleet of more than two dozen NASA Earth science missions circling our planet that gather data on oceans, land, ice and the atmosphere to provide more insights into how Earth’s climate is changing. Together, missions like PACE and the international Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission, known as SWOT, that launched in 2022 could also change the way researchers understand Earth’s oceans. “We are undeniably in the midst of a climate crisis,” said NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy. “Our planet is undergoing transformative changes from the surge in extreme weather events and devastating wildfires to the rising sea levels. NASA is not just a space and aeronautics agency. We are a climate agency. We leverage the unique vantage point of space to study our home as a holistic planet, collecting vital earth science data. This information is then available to people worldwide, empowering them to make informed decisions on how to safeguard our planet and its inhabitants for generations to come.” In January, NASA and other agencies announced that 2023 was the hottest year on record, part of an overall trend in which global temperatures have warmed over the past decade, said Kate Calvin, chief scientist and senior climate advisor at NASA. The warming is largely driven by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. After being released, carbon dioxide is absorbed by land and the oceans, but some of it remains in the atmosphere and traps greenhouse gases that warm up the planet. “One of the great things about a mission like PACE is it’s going to give us a better understanding of the exchange of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere,” Calvin said. But other factors contribute to warming, including aerosol particles in the atmosphere that are collectively made of pollutants, dust, smoke and sea salt. Aerosols can reflect or absorb sunlight and affect cloud formation, Calvin said. Aerosols play a tremendous role in Earth’s weather, air quality and climate, St. Germain said. “They come from sources like dust blowing off the Sahara wildfires and even human activities,” St. Germain said. “They seed clouds that can grow into hurricanes coming across the Atlantic, but they also reflect a lot of the sun’s energy. So, they to play an important role in the long-term stability of Earth’s climate.” Aerosols can contribute to bad air quality that drives chronic conditions like asthma, and understanding the composition of aerosols and their location in the atmosphere can help determine hotspots for polluted air and provide better warnings, said Andy Sayer, PACE atmospheric scientist. The two polarimeter instruments on PACE will help scientists study the particle size, composition and amount of aerosols in Earth’s atmosphere across an array of wavelengths to provide a detailed portrait of the most problematic areas. About 70% of Earth’s surface is covered by oceans, and these massive bodies of water typically present more questions than answers — but scientists hope PACE can help change that. “In many ways, we know more about the surface of the moon than we do about our own oceans,” St. Germain said. “PACE will be the most advanced mission we’ve ever launched to study ocean biology. It’s going to teach us about the oceans in the same way that Webb is teaching us about the cosmos.” From orbit, PACE will search for the light reflected from tiny organisms called phytoplankton to see where they thrive floating on the surface of Earth’s oceans. The mission carries the Ocean Color Instrument. It will use more than 100 different wavelengths of light to study phytoplankton on a global scale and identify different species, including some that pose a threat to other life-forms, from space for the first time. Phytoplankton exist at the base of the marine food web. Without the tiny organisms, that web would collapse, and a lack of global fisheries could be devastating for humans, according to NASA. These microalgae use photosynthesis to absorb carbon dioxide and sunlight, generating oxygen and carbohydrates that nourish all types of marine life. Phytoplankton began photosynthesizing more than 3 billion years ago, long before trees and plants did, and have contributed about 50% of all the oxygen ever produced on Earth, according to NASA. While phytoplankton play a major role in drawing carbon dioxide from Earth’s atmosphere, some species can be harmful, too. Algal blooms can be critical to marine food webs like those in polar regions, but some blooms produce dangerous toxins that can spoil drinking water and disrupt entire ecosystems. The observations from PACE can help scientists understand which species cause the toxic blooms, track and monitor them over time, and determine how to prevent them going forward. “I like to say that PACE is a mission that will use that unique vantage point of space to study the smallest things that have the biggest impact in the oceans,” St. Germain said."

And as the planet warms, there are already indications it is heading in this direction. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (the AMOC) — of which the Gulf Stream is part — works like a giant global conveyor belt, taking warm water from the tropics toward the far North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southward. The currents carry heat and nutrients to different areas of the globe and play a vital role in keeping the climate of large parts of the Northern Hemisphere relatively mild. For decades, scientists have been sounding the alarm on the circulation’s stability as climate change warms the ocean and melts ice, disrupting the balance of heat and salt that determines the currents’ strength. While many scientists believe the AMOC will slow under climate change, and could even grind to a halt, there remains huge uncertainty over when and how fast this could happen. The AMOC has only been monitored continuously since 2004. Scientists do know — from building a picture of the past using things like ice cores and ocean sediments — the AMOC shut down more than 12,000 years ago following rapid glacier melt. Now they are scrambling to work out if it could happen again. This new study provides an “important breakthrough,” said René van Westen, a marine and atmospheric researcher at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and study co-author. The scientists used a supercomputer to run complex climate models over a period of three months, simulating a gradual increase of freshwater to the AMOC — representing ice melt as well as rainfall and river runoff, which can dilute the ocean’s salinity and weaken the currents. As they slowly increased the freshwater in the model, they saw the AMOC gradually weaken until it abruptly collapsed. It’s the first time a collapse has been detectable using these complex models, representing “bad news for the climate system and humanity,” the report says. What the study doesn’t do, however, is give timeframes for a potential collapse. More research is needed, van Westen told CNN, including models which also mimic climate change impacts, such as increasing levels of planet-heating pollution, which this study did not. “But we can at least say that we are heading in the direction of the tipping point under climate change,” van Westen said. The impacts of the AMOC’s collapse could be catastrophic. Some parts of Europe might see temperatures plunge by up to 30 degrees Celsius over a century, the study finds, leading to a completely different climate over the course of just a decade or two. “No realistic adaptation measures can deal with such rapid temperature changes,” the study authors write. Countries in the Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand, could see increased warming, while the Amazon’s wet and dry seasons could flip, causing serious disruption to the ecosystem. The AMOC’s collapse could also cause sea levels to surge by around 1 meter (3.3 feet), van Westen said. Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer at Potsdam University in Germany, who was not involved with the study, said it was “a major advance in AMOC stability science.” “It confirms that the AMOC has a tipping point beyond which it breaks down if the Northern Atlantic Ocean is diluted with freshwater,” he told CNN. Previous studies finding the AMOC’s tipping point used much simpler models, he said, giving hope to some scientists that it might not be found under more complex models. This study crushes those hopes, Rahmstorf said. Joel Hirschi, associate head of marine systems modeling at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK, said the study was the first to use complex climate models to show the AMOC can flip from “on” to “off” in response to relatively small amounts of freshwater entering the ocean. But there are reasons to be cautious, he added. Even though the study used a complex model, it still has a low resolution, he said, meaning there could be limitations in representing some parts of the currents. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that the AMOC may be approaching a tipping point — and that it could even be close. A 2021 study found that the AMOC was weaker than any other time in the past 1,000 years. And a particularly alarming — and somewhat controversial — report published in July last year, concluded that the AMOC could be on course to collapse potentially as early as 2025. Yet huge uncertainties remain. Jeffrey Kargel, senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona, said he suspected the theory of a potentially imminent shutdown of the AMOC “will remain somewhat controversial until, one year, we know that it is happening.” He likened its potential collapse to the “wild gyrations of a stock market that precede a major crash” — it’s nearly impossible to unpick which changes are reversible, and which are a precursor to a disaster. Modern data shows the AMOC’s strength fluctuates, but there is no observed evidence yet of a decline, Hirschi said. “Whether abrupt changes in the AMOC similar to those seen in the past will occur as our climate continues to warm is an important open question.” This study is a piece of that puzzle, Rahmstorf said. “(It) adds significantly to the rising concern about an AMOC collapse in the not too distant future,” he said. “We will ignore this risk at our peril.”"

","Angela Dewan, CNN","The area of Greenland’s ice loss in the past three decades is roughly 36 times the size of New York City — land that is rapidly giving way to wetlands and shrubs, a study published Tuesday shows. The amount of vegetation in Greenland doubled between the mid-1980s and mid-2010s, as swaths of the country that were once covered in ice and snow were transformed into barren rock, wetlands or shrub area. Wetlands alone quadrupled in that time. By analyzing satellite imagery, the scientists found that Greenland had lost 28,707 square-kilometers (around 11,000 square-miles) of ice in the three-decade period, and warned of a cascade of impacts that could have serious consequences for climate change and sea level rise. Warmer air temperatures have driven ice loss, which has in turn raised land temperatures. That has caused the melting of permafrost, a frozen layer just beneath the Earth’s surface and found in much of the Arctic, and that melt releases planet-warming carbon dioxide and methane, contributing to more global warming. Permafrost melt is also causing land instability, which could impact infrastructure and buildings. “We have seen signs that the loss of ice is triggering other reactions which will result in further loss of ice and further ‘greening’ of Greenland, where shrinking ice exposes bare rock that is then colonized by tundra and eventually shrub,” one of the report’s authors, Jonathan Carrivick, said in a press release. “At the same time, water released from the melting ice is moving sediment and silt, and that eventually forms wetlands and fenlands.” The loss of ice is creating what’s known as a feedback loop. Snow and ice typically reflect the sun’s energy back into space, preventing excessive heating in parts of the Earth. But as ice disappears, those areas absorb more solar energy, raising land surface temperatures, which can cause further melt and other negative impacts. Ice melt also increases the amount of water in lakes, where water absorbs more heat than snow, which increases land surface temperatures. Greenland has been warming at twice the global mean rate since the 1970s, and the study’s authors warn that more extreme temperatures in the future are likely. Greenland is the world’s biggest island and is mostly covered by ice and glaciers. Around 57,000 people live in the country, which is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. Much of the population is indigenous and many people there rely on natural ecosystems for their survival. Michael Grimes, the report’s lead author, said that the flow of sediments and nutrients into coastal waters was particularly problematic for indigenous communities that rely on fishing, as well as for hunters on other parts of the island. “These changes are critical, particularly for the indigenous populations whose traditional subsistence hunting practices rely on the stability of these delicate ecosystems,” he said. “Moreover, the loss of ice mass in Greenland is a substantial contributor to global sea level rise, a trend that poses significant challenges both now and in the future.”"

","Rosa Rahimi, CNN","The Amazon rainforest is on course to reach a crucial tipping point as soon as 2050, with devastating consequences for the region and the world’s ability to tackle climate change, according to a study published Wednesday. The Amazon has proven resilient to natural changes in the climate for 65 million years, but deforestation and the human-caused climate crisis have brought new levels of stress and could cause a large-scale collapse of the forest system within the next three decades, the study said. The researchers predict that 10% to 47% of the Amazon will be exposed to stresses that could push the ecosystem to its tipping point, a critical threshold that once crossed will lead to a downward spiral of impacts. The study, led by researchers at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil and published in the journal Nature, takes a holistic approach to estimating how soon the Amazon could reach that threshold. The study’s authors looked at the impact of warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and fires to draw their conclusions. “We already knew about all these factors at play, but once we connected the pieces of this complex puzzle, the image was alarming,” Bernardo Flores, lead author of the study, told CNN. “Our findings revealed how the Amazon forest system could enter a phase of self-reinforced collapse sooner than previously thought.” Previous studies had not predicted a collapse of this scale could happen in the 21st century. A collapse of the Amazon, the world’s vastest tropical rainforest, would weaken its ability to absorb planet-warming carbon pollution from the atmosphere, which would exacerbate global warming. Once known as the lungs of the planet, the Amazon has already become a net emitter of carbon emissions, meaning it releases more carbon into the atmosphere now than it absorbs. Forest fires and logging are the main reasons for that change. But the forest is still a huge, crucial carbon sink. It holds the equivalent of 15 to 20 years of the entire world’s global carbon stores. The study also shows how a deteriorating Amazon could impact forests in other parts of South America. The Amazon is crucial for water supply across the region, the study said, contributing as much as half of its rainfall through what the authors call “flying rivers” – rain that originates over the Amazon and spreads to other parts of the region. That means other forests and ecosystems that rely on rain are able to thrive. Those places include the Pantanal wetlands — the world’s largest tropical wetlands that cross Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay — and the La Plata River basin, a biodiverse and crucial water system that drains one-fifth of South American land. The Amazon provides moisture beyond the region, too. “The Amazon forest is a major pump of moisture into the atmosphere, contributing to circulation processes that transfer moisture across the globe,” Flores said. “When the forest is reduced, this weakens this process, causing the global climate to find a new equilibrium.” The authors of the study noted that water stress was a common factor in the disturbances to the Amazon. Water stress occurs when there is not enough water to meet human or ecological needs. Global warming is intensifying the effects of water stress by causing the Amazonian climate to become drier and warmer. This increases water stress on trees, particularly those with low drought resistance in northwest parts of the forest, which “could suffer massive mortality if suddenly exposed to severe water stress,” according to the study. Reaching its tipping point could also make parts of the Amazon uninhabitable due to unbearable heat and a lack of resources for indigenous peoples and local communities, the study shows. “A war of attrition on the Amazon rainforest is being waged through human-caused climate change and deforestation, which is sending this irreplaceable jewel of the planet to the brink,” said Richard Allan, a professor in Climate Science at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the study. “These critical effects … are compounded by continued destruction of forest for agriculture, settlement, and industry.” The study recommends ending deforestation, promoting forest restoration, and expanding protected areas and Indigenous territories. Flores also stressed the need for global cooperation to cut greenhouse gas emissions and emphasized the importance of Amazonian countries cooperating to promote forest restoration."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/16/business/gas-prices-inflation/index.html,Don’t look now but gas prices are rising fast,02-16-2024,                                                 You’re not imagining it: Gasoline prices are moving swiftly higher across the country.                                             ,"Matt Egan, CNN","You’re not imagining it: Gasoline prices are moving swiftly higher across the country. The national average has climbed 11 cents in the past week alone, to $3.28 a gallon, according to AAA. That means millions of Americans hitting the roads this Presidents’ Day weekend will be greeted by the highest prices in nearly three months. Some of this jump in pump prices is normal. Gas prices always rise as winter winds down because demand increases and gas stations must switch over to more expensive summer fuel. Some of this jump is abnormal. Refinery outages — including a weekslong shutdown of the largest refinery in the Midwest — are limiting the supply of gas. No matter the cause, rising gas prices are bad news for consumers already frustrated by the cost of living. And this trend could cause headaches for officials in Washington — especially if it accelerates. Higher gas prices complicate the Federal Reserve’s war on inflation. And they undercut the election year message of a White House that previously pointed to cheap gas prices as evidence that Bidenomics is working. The higher prices go, the bigger the headaches. “It’s a very sensitive subject for Americans,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “The White House is somewhat powerless. The president doesn’t really deserve credit or blame. The market will do what it’s going to do.” Gas prices bottomed at $3.07 a gallon nationally on January 15. Since then, the national average has increased by 21 cents to $3.28 on Friday. So far, this is well within what’s considered normal. De Haan said that over the past decade, gas prices have increased by between 35 and 85 cents a gallon between the winter low and the spring-summer peak. This happens for good reasons. First, oil prices — the main driver of retail gas prices — tend to increase during this time of the year. That’s true again now. US crude has increased by about $10 since mid-December, to $78 a barrel today. Investors know that demand for fuel increases as people drive more often and take road trips in warmer weather. “January and February are the lowest gas demand months,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates. “We are moving into higher demand months. That should be no surprise. It’s been this way for 50 years.” Another annual tradition: Gas stations switch over to more expensive summer blends of fuel. That transition has already happened in Southern California — a switch that can add about 30 cents a gallon to gas prices. At the same time, refineries often shut down for regularly scheduled maintenance late in the winter and early in the spring. Those shutdowns limit how much oil the refinery system can turn into gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. What’s complicated matters this winter is there have been some unscheduled refinery outages. Most notably, BP’s Whiting refinery in northwest Indiana has been shut down for weeks. That’s a big deal because this refinery is not just BP’s largest in the world, it’s the biggest in the Midwest. BP says Whiting can produce enough gasoline each day to support the average daily travel of 7 million cars. It’s no coincidence then, that states in the Midwest have experienced the biggest price spikes. Over the past month, gas prices have surged by 47 cents in Ohio, 40 cents in Indiana and 36 cents in Illinois, according to AAA. Refinery outages in the Rocky Mountain region — which includes Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico — have also helped drive up the price of gas there. In the past week, gas has risen by 26 cents in New Mexico and by 21 cents in Colorado, according to the driving club. A series of refinery closures in recent decades has made the country more vulnerable to unexpected outages — including those caused by extreme weather. For instance, without the usual backstop, last summer’s historic heatwave that knocked some refineries offline unexpectedly lifted gas prices across the country. It’s worth noting that while gas prices have gone up sharply in recent weeks, it’s cheaper to fill up than it was a year ago. The national average for regular gas stood at $3.42 a gallon at this point last year. Looking ahead, experts are confident gas prices will continue to rise — but likely at a slower pace. As long as there are no major surprises, Lipow expects the national average will peak at between $3.50 and $3.75 a gallon this summer. That’s a far cry from the unprecedented spike above $5 a gallon in June 2022. “There is more than adequate crude oil supply — unless we get a major disruption due to tensions spreading throughout the Middle East,” Lipow said. If the Israel-Hamas war spreads and derails supply from Iran and Saudi Arabia, prices would likely spike. GasBuddy’s De Haan expects the national average will hit $3.50 a gallon by March or April. But he doesn’t see gas prices hitting $4 a gallon this year — unless something goes wrong. “A refinery outage here or an Arab Spring there could cause prices to go up a lot more,” he said."

","Elliana Hebert and Sara Tonks, CNN","Two storms, including another long-lasting atmospheric river event, will drench much of California starting Saturday and well into next week, raising the risk of flooding and landslides. The state is still recovering from a particularly potent storm that brought record-breaking rain and hundreds of mudslides to Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California in early February. The two storms aren’t forecast to be as devastating as early February’s, but the repeated rounds of rain and the slow-moving nature of the second storm will bring a significant threat for flooding. As a result, more than 27 million people are under flood watches stretching from Northern California south to parts of the Los Angeles area. The first storm is expected to be weaker than the second, but “will act as a primer, increasing soil moisture and causing the streams and rivers to rise before the heavier rain on Sunday” from the second storm, the National Weather Service said. It will march into the Northern California coast early morning Saturday and spend the rest of the day soaking the region with ﻿1 to 2 inches of moderate rainfall. Only light rain is expected in the Central Coast and Southern California. Emergency management officials in Santa Barbara County issued evacuation warnings in some parts of the county on Saturday ahead of the expected storm. The second, more potent storm will arrive on Sunday afternoon and stall near the coast into early next week, increasing the potential for excessive precipitation through Wednesday across much of the state. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for the county beginning Sunday afternoon and lasting through Wednesday morning. Impactful weather in the northern part of the state will mostly occur on Sunday, with 1 to 3 inches of rain in the lowlands and 3 to 5 inches expected in higher elevations. “Soils around the Bay Area are near saturation, so the rainfall will runoff quickly and likely contribute to numerous shallow landslides along areas of steep terrain,” the National Weather Service office in San Francisco said. There will also be gusty winds, but not nearly as severe as the deadly hurricane-force gusts in the early February storm that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands. Wind gusts of 35 to 50 mph are most likely Sunday night into Monday and “could lead to more downed trees and potential power outages,” the San Francisco forecast office said. The heaviest rain will begin to shift south late Sunday and early Monday, enveloping the Central Coast and parts of Southern California. Santa Barbara in particular is under a Level 3 of 4 risk for flooding rain starting Sunday and lasting through Monday night. By Monday afternoon the heavy rain reaches Los Angeles, where a Level 2 of 4 risk for flooding rain is in place from Tuesday into early Wednesday. “Rainfall rates in this region have the potential to reach 0.5 to 1 inches per hour, with over 1 inch per hour rates possible,” the Weather Prediction Center said. Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches are forecast in coastal areas and 4 to 6 inches in higher elevations from Sunday to Wednesday. “This amount of rain along with last week’s totals will bring significant concerns for flooding and landslides,” the National Weather Service office in Los Angeles said. While the coast is to be drenched with significant rainfall, higher elevations are forecast to receive more snow. Saturday’s storm is going to be the weaker of the two systems in terms of snow accumulation, with 4 to 10 inches of snow expected in high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade mountains by Sunday morning. “Mount Shasta could easily see two feet of snow accumulation Saturday/Saturday night across their high terrain which may lead to some happy folks at the ski park,” says the National Weather Service office in Medford, Oregon. The second storm, however, has a lot more snow to bring to the region. By Wednesday, snowfall totals in the Sierra Nevada could reach up to 1 to 2 feet for areas above 5500 feet in elevation, and the highest peaks could see up to 4 feet of snow. “Mountain travel is highly discouraged while the Warning is in effect, as potential impacts include difficult to impossible travel conditions, snow covered roads, chain controls, reduced visibility and road closures,” warns the National Weather Service office in Sacramento."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/18/weather/la-nina-hurricane-season-climate/index.html,It’s already hurricane season in the waters of the Atlantic. That could spell danger with La Niña coming,02-18-2024,                                                 Experts say there are already warning signs that there could be a supercharged hurricane season.                                             ,"Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Hurricane season is months away, but the waters where hurricanes roam haven’t received the memo. Ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic are historically warm for this early in the year, raising the risk of a hyperactive storm season that could also be supercharged by a budding La Niña. “This season should be full speed ahead, as there are no factors going against an active season,” Brian McNoldy, a senior research scientist at the University of Miami, told CNN. “We’ll likely have an anomalously warm ocean and neutral or La Niña conditions for the peak of hurricane season – all the things you don’t want if you want less Atlantic storms.” Stronger ones, too. Warm water provides the necessary fuel not just to help storms form, but to also boost their strength. Sea surface temperatures across the North Atlantic Ocean reached a level unheard of for February earlier this month: 1 degree Celsius above what’s typical, and more akin to June than February. They were even higher in the part where most Atlantic hurricanes form, reaching July-like levels from West Africa to Central America. It’s a continuation of record-smashing global ocean heat that started last March and hasn’t stopped since – driven by a super El Niño and global temperature rise from human-caused climate change, McNoldy said. “(The heat) was so far above anything ever observed that it seemed impossible it would happen,” McNoldy said. But it did. And ocean temperatures this year are off to an even warmer start than last year, including in the Atlantic, which could set the stage for a dangerous hurricane season. “It’s February and a lot can still change. But if it doesn’t, then it could potentially be a very busy season,” said Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University. North Atlantic temperatures typically only go up from here, climbing in spring and reaching a maximum in early fall when hurricane season also peaks. And they are “almost certainly” going to continue to be warmer-than-normal into the summer, McNoldy said. That forecast becomes even more alarming when paired with the likelihood of a La Niña – an ocean and weather pattern over the tropical Pacific that has a tendency to amplify Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical systems need several atmospheric factors to come together to form, but one of the most important is low levels of wind shear – upper level winds that, if strong, can rip storms apart or even keep them from forming in the first place. Wind shear in the Atlantic typically decreases during La Niña, making it easier for more storms to form, strengthen and potentially impact land. La Niña’s timing matters, since the resulting changes in the atmosphere will not be instantaneous, according to Klotzbach. It takes time for La Niña’s influence to percolate to the Atlantic. The earlier La Niña arrives, the sooner it would influence hurricane season. “If you don’t want an active hurricane season, you would need La Niña to wait as long as possible to begin,” McNoldy said. Forecasters with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center believe La Niña could arrive as soon as summer, but more likely by fall. It’s difficult to know what the combination of near-record ocean warmth and a La Niña could be capable of, since there has been no other hurricane season in which temperatures were this extreme, Klotzbach said. The 2010 and 2005 seasons were two of the most active and included notorious storms like like Katrina, Rita and Irene. Both had neutral or La Niña conditions in place, “but (similar outcomes aren’t) a guarantee since the anomalies now are very much warmer than any other year in recent record,” Klotzbach said. Last year’s very active season also had no perfect analog. It was under the influence of El Niño, which should have suppressed storm activity, but was partly neutralized by the record-warm Atlantic. Twenty storms formed – the fourth-most on record. Even if the season starts without any of La Niña’s influence, abnormally warm waters could still mean we see storms develop quite early in the season, a concern echoed by both McNoldy and Klotzbach. But an active season isn’t necessarily the same as an impactful season. Many of last year’s storms didn’t hit land or populated areas, but having more storms increases the chances of a high-impact landfall. “The more darts you throw at a dartboard, the more likely some are to stick. So, when more storms develop, it becomes more likely some will make landfall,” Klotzbach explained. It’s simply too soon to know with confidence that this season will be impactful, as “day-to-day weather patterns” steer storms toward or away from land, Klotzbach said. However the upcoming season shakes out, McNoldy urged anyone located in hurricane-prone regions to do two important things. “Pay close attention to each storm that develops and don’t get complacent.”"

Nowhere has this been more the case than in the central and eastern US. Despite a brief but significant outbreak of Arctic air in mid-January and a few chilly days last week, mild conditions have been the norm. The warmth is about to ratchet up a notch next week. An area stretching from Dallas north to Minneapolis and east to Philadelphia will soar to levels more akin to May or June than the end of February. More than 200 daily temperature records could be tied or broken as daytime highs climb and overnight lows fail to cool off. The significant warming trend kicks off Sunday in the central US and become more intense by Monday. A northward shift in the jet stream will allow very warm air to rush north from the Gulf of Mexico and reach the Canadian border. Monday will likely be the warmest day of the year so far for cities including St. Louis, Dallas and Chicago. That will also notably be the case in typically-cold parts of the central US. High temperatures there could be as much as 30 degrees above normal. Omaha, Nebraska, is forecast to climb into the 70s on Monday. The city should normally top out around 40 degrees at the end of February and typically doesn’t record its first 70 degree temperature until late March. Dallas may flirt with the 90-degree mark on Monday – a threshold that isn’t typically eclipsed until late April. Triple-digit temperatures are possible for parts of Texas near the Mexico border. The core of the unseasonable warmth spreads east on Tuesday to encompass much of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. High temperatures in the 60s are likely from Chicago to Cleveland, while St. Louis could approach 80 degrees. And there won’t be any relief for Texas with highs in the 80s and 90s likely. Warmth reaches the East Coast by Wednesday. Philadelphia and New York City could top out in the 60s. The Gulf Coast and the Southeast will continue to sizzle. With spring-like warmth comes spring-like weather. A storm forecast to develop near the Great Lakes late Tuesday could unload rain and thunderstorms on much of the East into Thursday. The clash of warm, moist air with the storm’s potent cold front could set the stage in parts of the Plains and Midwest for some severe thunderstorms late Tuesday. The same threat could carry on east into parts of the Southeast and Ohio Valley Wednesday. A quick flip back to a more-seasonable chill is likely in the north-central US Tuesday and Wednesday behind the cold front. But the brief burst of cold is likely too little too late to resurrect a largely nonexistent winter, which officially ends in March. This winter is on pace to become one of the warmest on record in dozens of US cities, with the highest concentration in the Midwest and Northeast. Warmth and winter weather do not get along. Winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the US and snowfall is declining around the globe as temperatures rise because of human-caused climate change. Across the Midwest and Great Lakes, snowfall is a few feet below what’s normal by this point. Over a foot and a half of snow is still missing for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, despite finally recording a few inches of snow earlier this month. Snowfall deficits are extreme downwind of the Great Lakes where Syracuse, New York, and Erie, Pennsylvania, are each missing nearly 5 feet of snow. Ice is also almost nowhere to be found on the Great Lakes. Close to 40% of the Great Lakes are typically covered in ice by late February, but total ice coverage was near a record-low 6% Thursday. There’s more bad news for snow and ice chances – the warmth is sticking around. Temperatures across the eastern two-thirds of the US are forecast to remain above average through at least early March. The northern tier of the US will also likely remain unseasonably warm beyond then, through much of March, according to the Climate Prediction Center."

Sometimes it comes on for an hour or two, but only a small trickle, barely enough to fill a couple of buckets. Then nothing for many days. Gomez, who lives in Mexico City’s Tlalpan district, doesn’t have a big storage tank so can’t get water truck deliveries — there’s simply nowhere to store it. Instead, he and his family eke out what they can buy and store. When they wash themselves, they capture the runoff to flush the toilet. It’s hard, he told CNN. “We need water, it’s essential for everything.” Water shortages are not uncommon in this neighborhood, but this time feels different, Gomez said. “Right now, we are getting this hot weather. It’s even worse, things are more complicated.” Mexico City, a sprawling metropolis of nearly 22 million people and one of the world’s biggest cities, is facing a severe water crisis as a tangle of problems — including geography, chaotic urban development and leaky infrastructure — are compounded by the impacts of climate change. Years of abnormally low rainfall, longer dry periods and high temperatures have added stress to a water system already straining to cope with increased demand. Authorities have been forced to introduce significant restrictions on the water pumped from reservoirs. “Several neighborhoods have suffered from a lack of water for weeks, and there are still four months left for the rains to start,” said Christian Domínguez Sarmiento, an atmospheric scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Politicians are downplaying any sense of crisis, but some experts say the situation has now reached such critical levels that Mexico City could be barreling towards “day zero” in a matter of months — where the taps run dry for huge swaths of the city. Densely populated Mexico City stretches out across a high-altitude lake bed, around 7,300 feet above sea level. It was built on clay-rich soil — into which it is now sinking — and is prone to earthquakes and highly vulnerable to climate change. It’s perhaps one of the last places anyone would choose to build a megacity today. The Aztecs chose this spot to build their city of Tenochtitlan in 1325, when it was a series of lakes. They built on an island, expanding the city outwards, constructing networks of canals and bridges to work with the water. But when the Spanish arrived in the early 16th century, they tore down much of the city, drained the lakebed, filled in canals and ripped out forests. They saw “water as an enemy to overcome for the city to thrive,” said Jose Alfredo Ramirez, an architect and co-director of Groundlab, a design and policy research organization. Their decision paved the way for many of Mexico City’s modern problems. Wetlands and rivers have been replaced with concrete and asphalt. In the rainy season, it floods. In the dry season, it’s parched. Around 60% of Mexico City’s water comes from its underground aquifer, but this has been so over-extracted that the city is sinking at a frightening rate — around 20 inches a year, according to recent research. And the aquifer is not being replenished anywhere near fast enough. The rainwater rolls off the city’s hard, impermeable surfaces, rather than sinking into the ground. The rest of the city’s water is pumped vast distances uphill from sources outside the city, in an incredibly inefficient process, during which around 40% of the water is lost through leaks. The Cutzamala water system, a network of reservoirs, pumping stations, canals and tunnels, supplies about 25% of the water used by the Valley of Mexico, which includes Mexico City. But severe drought has taken its toll. Currently, at around 39% of capacity, it’s been languishing at a historic low. “It’s almost half of the amount of water that we should have,” said Fabiola Sosa-Rodríguez, head of economic growth and environment at the Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico City. In October, Conagua, the country’s national water commission, announced it would restrict water from Cutzamala by 8% “to ensure the supply of drinking water to the population given the severe drought.” Just a few weeks later, officials significantly tightened restrictions, reducing the water supplied by the system by nearly 25%, blaming extreme weather conditions. “Measures will have to be taken to be able to distribute the water that Cutzamala has over time, to ensure that it does not run out,” Germán Arturo Martínez Santoyo, the director general of Conagua, said in a statement at the time. Around 60% of Mexico is experiencing moderate to exceptional drought, according to a February report. Nearly 90% of Mexico City is in severe drought — and it’s set to get worse with the start of the rainy season still months away. “We are around the middle of the dry season with sustained temperature increases expected until April or May,” said June Garcia-Becerra, an assistant professor in engineering at the University of Northern British Columbia. Natural climate variability heavily affects this part of Mexico. Three years of La Niña brought drought to the region, and then the arrival of El Niño last year helped deliver a painfully short rainy season that failed to replenish the reservoirs. But the long-term trend of human-caused global warming hums in the background, fueling longer droughts and fiercer heat waves, as well as heavier rains when they do arrive. “Climate change has made droughts increasingly severe due to the lack of water,” said UNAM’s Sarmiento. Added to this, high temperatures “have caused the water that is available in the Cutzamala system to evaporate,” she said. Last summer saw brutal heat waves roil large parts of the country, which claimed at least 200 lives. These heat waves would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change, according to an analysis by scientists. The climate impacts have collided with the growing pains of a fast-expanding city. As the population booms, experts say the centralized water system has not kept pace. The crisis has set up a fierce debate about whether the city will reach a “day zero,” where the Cutzamala system falls to such low levels that it will be unable to provide any water to the city’s residents. Local media widely reported in early February that an official from a branch of Conagua said that without significant rain, “day zero” could arrive as early as June 26. But authorities have since sought to assure residents there will be no day zero. In a press conference on February 14, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that work was underway to address the water problems. Mexico City’s mayor, Martí Batres Guadarrama, said in a recent press conference that reports of day zero were “fake news” spread by political opponents. Conagua declined CNN’s interview requests and did not answer specific questions on the prospect of a day zero. But many experts warn of a spiraling crisis. Mexico City could run out of water before the rainy season arrives if it carries on using it in the same way, Sosa-Rodríguez said. “It’s probable that we will face a day zero,” she added. This doesn’t mean a complete collapse of the water system, she said, because the city isn’t dependent on just one source. It won’t be the same as when Cape Town in South Africa came perilously close to running totally dry in 2018 following a severe multi-year drought. “Some groups will still have water,” she said, “but most of the people won’t.” Raúl Rodríguez Márquez, president of the non-profit Water Advisory Council, said he doesn’t believe the city will reach a day zero this year — but, he warned, it will if changes are not made. “We are in a critical situation, and we could reach an extreme situation in the next few months,” he told CNN. For nearly a decade, Sosa-Rodríguez said she has been warning officials of the danger of a day zero for Mexico City. She said the solutions are clear: Better wastewater treatment would both increase water availability and decrease pollution, while rainwater harvesting systems could capture and treat the rain, and allow residents to reduce their reliance on the water network or water trucks by 30%. Fixing leaks would make the system much more efficient and reduce the volume of water that has to be extracted from the aquifer. And nature-based solutions, such as restoring rivers and wetlands, would help provide and purify water, she said, with the added advantage of greening and cooling the city. In a statement on its website, Conagua said it is undertaking a 3-year project to install, develop and improve water infrastructure to help the city cope with decreases in the Cutzamala system, including adding new wells and commissioning water treatment plants. But in the meantime, tensions are rising as some residents are forced to cope with shortages, while others — often in the wealthier enclaves — remain mostly unaffected. “There is a clear unequal access to water in the city and this is related to people’s income,” Sosa-Rodríguez said. While day zero might not be here yet for the whole of Mexico City, some neighborhoods have been grappling with it for years, she added. Amanda Martínez, another resident of the city’s Tlalpan district, said for people here, water shortages are nothing new. She and her family often have to pay more than $100 for a tank of water from one of the city’s water trucks. But it’s getting worse. Sometimes more than two weeks can go by without water and she fears what may be coming, she told CNN. “I don’t think anyone is prepared.” CNN’s Laura Paddison and Jack Guy reported from London, and Fidel Gutiérrez reported from Mexico City."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/climate/doomsday-glacier-antarctic-ice-melt-climate-intl/index.html,The ‘Doomsday Glacier’ is rapidly melting. Scientists now have evidence for when it started and why,02-27-2024,                                                 Scientists have looked back in time to reconstruct the past life of Antarctica’s “Doomsday Glacier.” Their findings give an alarming insight into future melting                                             ,"Laura Paddison, CNN","Scientists have looked back in time to reconstruct the past life of Antarctica’s “Doomsday Glacier” — nicknamed because its collapse could cause catastrophic sea level rise. They have discovered it started retreating rapidly in the 1940s, according to a new study that provides an alarming insight into future melting. The Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica is the world’s widest and roughly the size of Florida. Scientists knew it had been losing ice at an accelerating rate since the 1970s, but because satellite data only goes back a few decades, they didn’t know exactly when significant melting began. Now there is an answer to this question, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. By analyzing marine sediment cores extracted from beneath the ocean floor, researchers found the glacier began to significantly retreat in the 1940s, likely kicked off by a very strong El Niño event — a natural climate fluctuation which tends to have a warming impact. Since then, the glacier has been unable to recover, which may reflect the increasing impact of human-caused global warming, according to the report. What happens to Thwaites will have global reverberations. The glacier already contributes 4% of sea level rise as it sheds billions of tons of ice a year into the ocean. Its complete collapse could raise sea levels by more than 2 feet. But it also plays a vital role in the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, acting like a cork holding back the vast stretch of ice behind it. Thwaites’ collapse would undermine the stability of the ice sheet, which holds enough water to raise sea levels by at least 10 feet, causing catastrophic global flooding. The study’s findings match previous research on the neighboring Pine Island Glacier, one of the largest ice streams in Antarctica, which scientists also found started retreating rapidly in the 1940s. This makes the research significant, said Julia Wellner, an associate professor of geology at the University of Houston and one of the study’s authors. What’s happening to Thwaites is not specific to one glacier, but part of the bigger context of a changing climate, she told CNN. “If both glaciers are retreating at the same time, that’s further evidence that they’re actually being forced by something,” Wellner said. To build a picture of Thwaites’ life over the past nearly 12,000 years, the scientists took an icebreaker vessel up close to the edge of the glacier to collect ocean sediment cores from a range of depths. These cores provide a historical timeline. Each layer yields information about the ocean and ice going back thousands of years. By scanning and dating the sediments, the scientists were able to pinpoint when the substantial melting began. From this information, they believe Thwaites’ retreat was set off by an extreme El Niño that happened at a time when the glacier was likely already in a phase of melting, knocking it off balance. “It’s sort of like if you get kicked when you’re already sick, it’s going to have a much bigger impact,” Wellner said. The findings are alarming because they suggest that once big changes are triggered, it’s very hard to stop them, said James Smith, a marine geologist at the British Antarctic Survey and a study co-author. “Once an ice sheet retreat is set in motion it can continue for decades, even if what started it gets no worse,” he told CNN. While similar retreats have happened much further back in the past, the ice sheet recovered and regrew, Smith said. But these glaciers “show no signs of recovery, which likely reflects the growing influence of human-caused climate change.” Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved in the research, said the study confirms and adds detail to our understanding of how Thwaites’ retreat began. A system that was already close to being unstable “took a big shot from a mostly natural event,” said Scambos, referring to the El Niño. “Further events arising more from the warming climate trend took things further, and started the widespread retreat we’re seeing today,” he told CNN. Martin Truffer, a physics professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said the research shows if a glacier is in a sensitive state, “a single event can knock it into a retreat from which it is difficult to recover.” “Humans are changing the climate and this study shows that small continuous changes in climate can lead to step changes in glacier state,” said Truffer, who was not involved in the research. Antarctica is sometimes called the “sleeping giant,” because scientists are still trying to understand how vulnerable this icy, isolated continent may be as humans heat up the atmosphere and oceans. Wellner is a geologist — she focuses on the past not the future — but she said this study gives important and alarming context for what might happen to the ice in this vital stretch of Antarctica. It shows that even if a trigger for rapid melting has ended, that doesn’t mean the response stops. “So if the ice is already in retreat today,” she said, “just because we might stop warming, it might not stop its retreat.”"

But they typically become more frequent starting in the spring – May to July in the same parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes at risk Tuesday – as warmer temperatures take hold. The risk of severe storms was increased from a Level 2 of 5 to a Level 3 of 5 in these regions by the Storm Prediction Center as confidence grew in a potentially impactful severe storm event. The storms will rumble to life as a large portion of the US is strapped into a temperature roller coaster with notable rises and falls through the weekend. Dozens of daily and monthly records were shattered in the central US Monday as temperatures soared to springlike levels. At least 200 more records are in jeopardy through Wednesday over the eastern two-thirds of the US. The extreme warmth caps what has been one of the warmest winters on record for many from the Midwest to the Northeast and is emblematic of the kind of winters scientists expect more often as global temperatures rise because of human-caused climate change. Winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the US. The heat from this week’s event is being steered by a northward bulge in the jet stream – a river of air in the upper atmosphere that acts as a divider between warm and cold – over the central US. It’s allowing warmer, humid air to surge north from the Gulf of Mexico. The warm, moist air is two of the three ingredients needed to create thunderstorms. A potent cold front associated with a storm tracking into the Midwest will serve as the third ingredient and ignite the severe thunderstorms on Tuesday. Damaging wind gusts, large hail and a few tornadoes are the main risks associated with severe storms, but Tuesday could also have “a strong tornado or two,” the Storm Prediction Center said. Strong tornadoes are EF2-plus with winds greater than 111 mph. A Level 3 of 5 risk for severe storms is in place for parts of Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Within this area, far southern Illinois, southern Indiana and parts of northern Kentucky are most at risk for tornadoes. Other parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes are under a Level 2 of 5 risk for severe storms. Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Indianapolis could all face damaging thunderstorms. Disruptive thunderstorms look to hold off until the evening across southern Michigan, allowing many voters to stay dry at the polls for the Presidential primary Tuesday. Chicago’s greatest risk for strong thunderstorms and possible tornadoes will occur Tuesday evening. The risk for severe thunderstorms will decrease by Wednesday as the storm spreads into the East. Rain with a few embedded thunderstorms could soak much of the East Wednesday while temperatures plummet over the central US in the cold front’s wake. Temperature records were shattered in the central US Monday as the thermometer reached triple digits for the first time this year. Dallas sizzled as the high topped out at 94 degrees: smashing the daily record and falling just shy of the all-time February high. Killeen, Texas, reached 100 degrees. Minneapolis recorded its warmest-ever February day. Chicago smashed its daily high temperature record as it climbed to 71 degrees. The extreme heat spreads east on Tuesday. High temperatures climb 20 to 30 degrees above average from the southern Plains through the Great Lakes. Additional monthly records could be in jeopardy, especially in the Midwest and Great Lakes. High temperatures come crashing right back down for much of the region Wednesday. Temperatures could drop 30 to 40 degrees in just 24 hours in the central US. The cold will arrive so abruptly that Tuesday’s stormy weather may end as a bit of wintry mix or snow early Wednesday morning in Chicago. Chicago is forecast to reach the 70s again on Tuesday before plummeting to a high in the 20s Wednesday. Low temperatures in Minneapolis are forecast to plunge into the single digits by early Wednesday morning. Wednesday will likely be the warmest day of the week for the East Coast before the potent cold front arrives and topples temperatures Thursday. And the weather whiplash won’t stop. The blast of chill will be short-lived as temperatures in the central US climb close to springlike levels again by Friday and much of the East by Saturday. Above-average warmth is likely to persist through early March over the eastern half of the US, according to the Climate Prediction Center."

But this season, the resorts look more like muddy wastelands.                                             ","Barbie Latza Nadeau and Photography by Fiona Sibbett, CNN","Just an hour’s drive from Rome, local skiers have made the Apennine Mountains their winter playground for decades. But this season, the usually pristine white resorts look more like muddy wastelands. The few chairlifts operating glide over barren hills, peppered with hikers where snowboarders normally stream. In the midst of an exceptionally warm winter, resorts like Campo Felice have a major problem: there’s no snow. And a long-running drought means there isn’t enough water to make the amount of artificial snow needed to paint its slopes white. What little snow the resort’s owners produce is at constant threat of melting in the warmth. But they have managed to make enough for four pistes — ribbons of white on the bald brown hills. It’s something, at least, but a far cry from its usual 14 slopes. February is on track to be the warmest on record for the planet, following a record-hot year, as climate change and El Niño combined to make for a miserable ski season in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Devastating snow loss has hit European skiing particularly hard, including in the more famous Alps and Dolomites to the north. The climate crisis is making winters milder and shorter in many parts of the world, but Andrea Lallini, who runs Campo Felice with his brother, said it was as if winter didn’t show up this year at all. It’s been the worst in the 23 years his family has run the resort. All the snow they do have is artificial. “The problem this year is that there hasn’t been any precipitation, plus it has never gotten cold,” he told CNN. “We should have opened in December, but we couldn’t even make snow until mid-January,” he said, explaining it was too warm then to produce the snow. “We will have to close down a month early at this rate.” Temperatures need to be below the freezing mark to make artificial snow stick, and there just haven’t been enough such days this year. And with a lack of rain and record-breaking heatwaves, the lakes that normally provide water for artificial snow have run dry. The resort is literally buying water this season to feed its snow-making guns. Lallini worries that if they get more tough seasons, the whole operation may eventually become unsustainable. But Campo Felice is by no means the only one feeling the heat. Across all of Italy’s ski resorts, nearly 90% use artificial snow to some degree, according to Carlo Carmagnola, a snow expert with Météo France who studies the impact of climate change on ski resorts. In the French Alps, it’s 40%. In Austria, it’s up to 80%, he said. “These aren’t perfect systems, in the sense that you need to have sufficiently low temperatures and humidity conditions to be able to produce the snow,” Carmagnola told CNN. “And then, of course, you need water. And today, one of the most sensitive issues is the availability of and access to water resources, which in some valleys is already complicated, with conflicts at specific times of the season between agriculture, drinking water and snowmaking.” Snowmaking is incredibly energy intensive, and if the guns or cannons used to produce it run on fossil fuels, the process contributes to global warming — which is why natural snow is declining in the first place. There’s also concern snowpacks could hit a tipping point where they will decline more rapidly. A recent study showed that once average winter temperatures rise above 17 degrees Fahrenheit in a particular place, snowpacks there essentially fall off a cliff edge. Even fractional temperature rises above that point accelerate the loss of snow. Lallini and his brother, Luca Lallini, are running the family business in radically different conditions to those their father faced when he opened the resort. In the 1980s and 1990s, Campo Felice had no need for artificial snow at all, Luca Lallini told CNN, as he scrolled through old photos of snow so deep, it had to be scooped out of windows in the resort’s restaurants and bars. Now those same amenities sit closed, surrounded by dirt. These changes have been hard not just on the Lallini brothers, but their employees, which usually number 250 in the ski season. Just 50 have been called to work so far this year. “On an average Sunday in February, we’d see more than 6,000 people on all the slopes,” Lallini told CNN. “We don’t even have 500 for a whole weekend this year.” The year-end holidays and the month of February are usually the area’s best seasons. Holidays in Italy include an annual settimana bianca, or white week, in February, when schools close across the country so families can go skiing. Now Italian media are joking that the holiday was more of a settimana verde, a green week, with nearly half the nation’s ski slopes only partially open, or not open at all. The ski industry in this part of Italy is the main employer in the region, said Gennarino Di Stefano, the mayor of Rocca di Cambio, the highest altitude town in these mountains. “The effects of the lack of snow cause a series of problems,” he says, looking out over the muddy fields. He said each town in the region is deeply invested in skiing, which provides jobs for ski instructors, managers, bar and restaurant staff, and people who run the lifts, from all over the region. “Many people are not working,” he said. The lack of snow also impacts future skiers — the central Italian stretch of the Apennine Mountains is popular with budding winter sport athletes. Isidoro Francesi, a ski instructor at Campo Felice, says young competitive skiers have had to seek other sites at higher altitudes, where snow is more plentiful, to train. Usually, that means traveling farther north as well. “That’s expensive for families, but it is also an added economic burden here. We are all working less,” he said. “For those of us who have always worked here, it is heart-breaking to see nature spoiled like this.” CNN’s Camille Knight contributed from Paris and Antonia Mortensen contributed from Rome."

The EPA will move forward with finalizing rules cutting emissions from existing coal and new natural gas plants this spring, and begin work immediately on a separate rule for existing gas plants. It is yet another sign of an administration under pressure to dial back its ambitious climate policies as President Joe Biden and swing-state Democrats seek re-election in 2024 while facing Republican attacks on energy costs. The process to propose and enact new federal regulations is lengthy, and a new rule would not be done in time before the election. “As EPA works towards final standards to cut climate pollution from existing coal and new gas-fired power plants later this spring, the agency is taking a new, comprehensive approach to cover the entire fleet of natural gas-fired turbines, as well as cover more pollutants including climate, toxic and criteria air pollution,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. Regan stressed that “this stronger, more durable approach” to starting a separate rulemaking for existing gas plants would “achieve greater emissions reductions than the current proposal,” because it would focus on a wider range of pollutants and air toxins. The move comes as several environmental justice and climate groups have pressured the EPA to consider a stronger proposal for existing gas plants, complaining in letters to the agency that the proposed rule would have exempted too many facilities. “We applaud EPA as it moves to finalize urgently needed standards for existing coal plants and new gas plants, and we agree that we must have comprehensive solutions for fossil gas plant pollution,” Abigail Dillen, president of environmental law firm Earthjustice, said in a statement. “This more ambitious strategy will enable EPA to consider technologies that were not considered in its initial proposal and ensure that new standards do not shift pollution to dirty, uncontrolled plants and the communities they pollute.” Some groups have also been critical of the EPA’s proposed rule because it would require the use of emerging and expensive technologies, which environmental justice groups fear will be built in already marginalized communities. “We don’t need any false solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture that will add to the pollution burden that already exists in our communities,” said Robert Bullard, director of the Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice at Texas Southern University, and often referred to as the father of the environmental justice movement. Industry groups, including the trade association for electric utilities, also praised the delay. “While EEI has not seen the final rules, we appreciate that EPA has acknowledged our concerns with the proposed regulations for existing natural gas,” Emily Fisher, general counsel for Edison Electric Institute, said in a statement. While some groups applauded the move, others criticized the Biden administration. “We are extremely disappointed in EPA’s decision to delay finalizing carbon pollution standards for existing gas plants, which make up a significant portion of carbon emissions in the power sector,” Frank Sturges, attorney at the Clean Air Task Force. “Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants have gone uncontrolled for far too long, and we have no more time to waste.” Whether the Biden administration will be able to finish the work it started on its signature power plant rule depends on the results of the election. CNN and other outlets have also reported the Biden EPA is planning to delay rules that would cut down on pollution from cars and other light-duty vehicles, giving automakers more time to meet the standards."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Texas is no stranger to winter wildfires, but the ferocity of the Smokehouse Creek fire — the state’s largest on record after burning through more than 1 million acres — caught even the experts off guard. Its severity was due to a perfect storm of environmental factors: highly flammable grasses and strong winds combined with record-high temperatures and dry conditions — the kind of extreme weather often exacerbated by climate change. This fire adds to an ever-lengthening list of rapidly spreading, destructive wildfires in the US and elsewhere. As humans continue to heat up the world with fossil fuel pollution, scientists warn these kinds of fires will only become more common. The past several years have brought some of the United States’ most devastating fires. The fire that ripped through Maui in August, whipped up by a combination of heat, drought and strong winds, killed at least 100 people and was the deadliest US wildfire in more than a century. In California, 80% of the state’s largest wildfires have occurred in the last decade, including the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise. But it’s not just the US grappling with alarming new fire behavior. Canada experienced its worst wildfire season on record in 2023, with flames scorching more than 18 million hectares (44.5 million acres) — more than double the previous record. In Greece, winds and record temperatures led to deadly fires last summer, the largest ever recorded in the European Union. And in early February, wildfires tore through parts of Chile, killing more than 130 people. “We have certainly seen plenty of extreme and catastrophic fires and fire seasons across the globe in the past decade,” said John Abatzoglou, a climate professor at the University of California, Merced. What ties many of these fires together, he told CNN, is “rapid rates of fire spread and a sense of surprise on how quickly individual fires grew — or in the case of Canada, their entire fire season.” In many cases, climate change is playing a role, he added, “enabling more active fire seasons and very large fire events.” To understand why the Texas fires have been so fierce you have to look to last spring, said Luke Kanclerz, a fire analyst at Texas A&M Forest Service. Parts of the Texas Panhandle were drenched with rain, around 300% to 400% above average levels, which allowed grasses to grow very fast, he told CNN. Then, a hard freeze late in the fall meant all that grass went dormant. Sapped of moisture, they were highly flammable. It only took a short period of warm, dry weather for them to dry out further, providing a carpet for the fire to spread. Temperatures were unseasonably hot the day the fires started, climbing to more than 85 degrees Fahrenheit in some parts of the panhandle, Kanclerz said. Strong winds helped the fire pick up, and the passage of a windy cold front whipped it up further, causing the fire to shift direction and expand. The region’s geography compounded the situation. The fire was able to rage across the open landscape with little to stop it, making firefighting efforts extremely challenging. The fire grew explosively, engulfing up to 150 football fields of land every minute in the first few days. Kanclerz said it was clear before the fires broke out that wind, temperature and humidity indicators added up to critical fire conditions. “But the magnitude of the fire exceeded our expectations,” he said. It’s hard to witness, he added. Huge fires in these parts of Texas are “not unheard of,” he said, “but we hate to see the frequency of them.” Wildfires are fueled by a knot of factors, both natural and human-caused, but scientists say that global warming is loading the dice in favor of more intense and severe blazes. Hotter temperatures are the clearest climate change-fueled contributor to wildfires. Heat sucks the moisture from vegetation making it much more combustible. “Drier fuels are a critical part of fire, the drier the fuel the easier it is to start a fire,” said Mike Flannigan, professor of wildland fire at the University of Alberta. As well as drying out vegetation, heat could also change the vegetation. In Hawaii, hotter summers have made it easier for fast-growing and more combustible invasive species to take hold, displacing native vegetation such as shady forests. Periods of drought, which are becoming longer and more intense as the world warms, also dry out vegetation and increase the likelihood of fires igniting and spreading rapidly. The Maui fires happened as a third of the island struggled with drought. But drought isn’t always needed for fires to spread explosively, Abatzoglou said – something evidenced by the fact that as of earlier in the week, there was no drought where the Smokehouse Creek fire ignited and spread to. In West Texas, shorter periods of dryness can be enough to fuel huge fires when there is a bumper crop of grasses as well as high winds, he said. And these dry conditions are happening more often in the state, as elsewhere in the US. “There’s been a general decrease in relative humidity,” John Nielsen-Gammon, Texas state climatologist, told CNN. Scientists are still working to understand what impact, if any, global warming is having on the winds that whip up wildfires. Research has found climate change is fueling the rapid intensification of hurricanes, pushing storms to explode at a deadly pace. Hurricane Dora, a Category 4 storm which passed about 700 miles south of Hawaii’s Big Island, enhanced the strong winds that helped drive the Maui fires. But it’s hard to attribute climate change to the winds that fueled the Texas fires, Abatzoglou said, “any link right now is most likely weak.” Overall, however, climate projections “paint a future of more extreme fire weather conditions for the general region,” he added. It’s a picture that extends across the US, according to a recent report from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group, which found wildfire seasons are lengthening and intensifying as climate change increases the likelihood of the kind of extreme weather that favors fires. West Texas is one of the most affected states, said Kaitlyn Trudeau, a senior researcher at Climate Central. The Texas High Plains region, for example, experiences 32 additional days of warm, dry, windy conditions compared to the 1970s, she said. Devastating wildfires are increasingly part of life in the US, and elsewhere, Trudeau told CNN. “As long as the climate keeps warming and makes fire weather more common, the risks will only keep rising.” CNN’s Rachel Ramirez contributed to this report."

The version the Securities and Exchange Commission passed won’t require companies to include some of the secondary climate effects of their products. On Wednesday, SEC chairman Gary Gensler said he thought the finalized rules would “produce more useful information to investors. Far more useful, I think, than what they get today.” Parts of the rule will take effect in 2025 and it comes amid a push by the Biden administration to tackle climate change. “This was a widely expected political compromise in an election year,” Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor of accounting and auditing at Columbia Business School said. The newly adopted rule dropped one of the most contentious elements of the SEC’s initial March 2022 proposal, requiring companies to disclose emissions they are indirectly responsible for, called scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions from an oil company, for example, might be the thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide produced by gas-powered vehicles, even though oil companies do not produce cars. Critics have argued that tracking those emissions would be overly expensive and difficult for companies. Instead, the finalized rule requires large public companies to disclose the direct and indirect greenhouse gas pollution they deem material, meaning important enough to share with investors. Examples of the required emissions disclosures, called scope 1 and scope 2, include waste produced by a manufacturing process or the amount of air conditioning used in an office building. The new rules also require companies to share physical risks posed by climate change, including the threat of rising natural disasters like wildfires or hurricanes. Gensler has faced accusations of caving to business interests and Republican lawmakers by dropping some emissions requirements. “There is unfortunately a glaring problem with some of what I think are the political compromises that appear to have been made here, and that problem arises from the failure to adequately provide for the single most important data point that investors use and have been very clear they need which is greenhouse gas emissions data,” former acting chair and SEC commissioner Allison Herren Lee said on Wednesday. “To me, it’s like asking for a description of the portion of the iceberg that’s visible above the water when we all know that the real danger is what lurks below,” she added. On Wednesday, Gensler said scope 3 emissions were dropped “based upon public feedback,” noting that the agency has received 24,000 public comments since releasing the rule’s initial proposal in 2022. But even as some companies are concerned with the costs of tracking emissions, investors seem to welcome the new rules. According to a survey of 103 institutional investors by Workiva, a reporting compliance company, 91% believe new climate disclosure regulations will help them make more informed investments. Still, the SEC’s rule has been criticized by some groups who say it doesn’t go far enough. The Sierra Club, an environmental organization that pushes financial institutions to reduce investments in fossil fuels, called the rule a “positive step,” albeit one that “falls significantly short of what’s needed.” On Wednesday, Gensler said that the SEC has “no role” regarding climate risk and that the rule is focused on providing accurate disclosures for investors. Opponents of the rule say that even the new watered-down version is an overstep for the SEC, however. On Wednesday, nine Republican state attorneys general, led by West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, filed a legal challenge to the new regulations. “While the administration and the SEC has made some changes to the proposed rule, what they’ve released today is still wildly in defect and illegal and unconstitutional,” Morrisey said in a press conference announcing the filing. “We believe that we’re going to proceed in court and prevail.” Other Republican lawmakers voiced their criticism with the SEC on Wednesday, as well. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, called the rule “federal overreach at its worst,” in a statement Wednesday. “Ignoring the concerns of Americans, small business owners, and stakeholders from across the country, Chair Gensler pressed forward with a final rule that falls outside his agency’s authority and does far more to advance the Biden administration’s far-Left climate agenda than uphold the SEC’s mandate,” Scott said. Hester Pierce, an SEC commissioner who voted “no” on the rule, argued that the agency is underestimating the financial burden that tracking emissions and climate risk will pose for public companies. “At a time when few companies are choosing to go public, why would we add so substantially to the price tag?” she said. American multinational companies in Europe and California will likely have to report scope 3 emissions, even without the SEC’s rule. The SEC rules “set a relatively low bar in comparison to other widely accepted climate disclosure requirements,” said Steve Soter, a vice president and accountant at Workiva. In October, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a climate disclosure bill requiring private and public companies that do business in California to disclose scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions beginning in 2026. California’s bill comes after Europe passed its own rule, called the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. It forces certain companies that do business in Europe to publish information on environmental and social matters. That rule took effect in January 2023."

As remarkable as this might appear, it is not really surprising as the continuous warming of the climate system inevitably leads to new temperature extremes,” Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus, said in a statement. Even in the context of back-to-back months of unprecedented temperatures, February has been extreme. Global temperatures in the first half of the month in particular were “exceptionally high,” according to the analysis. Four consecutive days, from February 8 to 11, were 2 degrees warmer than those same days pre-industrial times. Restricting global heating to well below 2 degrees was a centerpiece of the Paris Agreement that almost every country signed up to in 2015. While scientists are much more concerned with longer-term warming, these temporary breaches are a clear and alarming sign of accelerating heating. Global ocean temperatures were also off the charts last month, hitting 21.06 degrees — the highest average for any month on record, according to the Copernicus data, beating the previous record of 20.98 degrees set in August 2023. Experts have expressed shock at just how hot the oceans have been, especially the North Atlantic, which has set a new daily temperature record every day since March 5 last year, according to Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School. “At times, the records have been broken by margins that are virtually statistically impossible,” McNoldy told CNN. Record ocean heat has significant global impacts. Not only is it dangerous for marine life but it also fuels extreme weather, including scorching heat waves, intense rainfall and ferocious hurricanes. The Copernicus data “tells a familiar story of warming temperatures and shifting patterns of weather,” said Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist and professor at the University of Reading in the UK. It is entirely consistent with what scientists have predicted would happen “as greenhouse gases continue to build up in our thin, life-giving atmosphere,” she told CNN. It provides yet more evidence that the world needs to reduce emissions drastically and immediately, Cloke said. If this evidence is ignored, Cloke added, “our children’s generation, and all those that follow, will be justified in pointing to the people who lived in 2024 and cursing our reckless stupidity.” CNN’s Derek Van Dam contributed to this report."

",Opinion by Bill McGuire,"Editor’s Note: Editor’s Note: Bill McGuire is professor emeritus of geophysical & climate hazards at University College London and author of “Hothouse Earth: An Inhabitant’s Guide.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN opinion here. Are you frightened by climate change? Do you worry about what sort of world we are bequeathing to our children and grandchildren? In the words of science writer and author of “The Uninhabitable Earth” David Wallace-Wells, “No matter how well informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough.” I would put it even more strongly. If the fracturing of our once stable climate doesn’t terrify you, then you don’t fully understand it. The reality is that, as far as we know, and in the natural course of events, our world has never — in its entire history — heated up as rapidly as it is doing now. Nor have greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere ever seen such a precipitous hike. Think about that for a moment. We’re experiencing, in our lifetimes, a heating episode that is probably unique in the last 4.6 billion years. While those of us working in the climate science field know the true picture, and understand the implications for our world, most others do not. And this is a problem — a big one. After all, we can’t act effectively to tackle a crisis if we don’t know its full depth and extent. What’s happening to our world scares the hell out of me, but if I shout the brutal, unvarnished truth from the rooftops, will this really galvanize you and others into fighting for the planet and your children’s futures? Or will it leave you frozen like a rabbit in headlights, convinced that all is lost? It is an absolutely critical question. With politicians and corporations unable or unwilling to take action rapidly enough to stymie emissions as the science demands, all we as climate scientists are left with is to seek to rouse the public to try and force through — via the ballot box and consumer choices — the enormous changes required to curb global heating. But would telling it like it is do the trick, or would the burden of truth be too much to bear? A major psychological study, published by the scientific journal Lancet Planetary Health in 2021, found that most 16–25 year olds in 10 countries across the globe were moderately to extremely worried about climate change, but more than half felt overwhelmed and powerless to act. It would seem reasonable to argue, on this basis, that painting an even worse picture wouldn’t help. But if this is the case, does it mean we shouldn’t provide people with the full facts if they are too scary? Surely not. In fact, this isn’t a matter of scaring or not scaring people, but of informing them. As a climate scientist, it is my duty to tell you about what is happening to our world, whether it engenders fear or not. A failure to do this will mean that the public is left ignorant of the true extent of the climate emergency, which in turn can only hinder engagement and action. This is already becoming a problem, with many commentators on the right of the political spectrum, along with some climate scientists, denigrating as “doomers” anyone flagging the worst outcomes of global heating. Such climate “appeasement” is increasingly taking the place of denial and could be an even greater driver of inertia than fear, as it plays down the enormity of the problem — and as an inevitable consequence, the urgency of action. The truth is that people can take being scared if they know there is still hope and that they can do something to make things better, or at least stop things getting worse. A 2022 study by researchers from the University of Bath in the UK found that scary images of wildfires and other climate-related catastrophes around the world were particularly effective at cultivating climate anxiety, defined by the American Psychological Association as the chronic fear of environmental doom. Rather than leading to inaction, however, the study showed that this could be a motivating force that spurred the sample of UK adults to adopt measures that helped to reduce emissions. Critically, the authors of the study observed that the reality of climate change has to be communicated without inducing a feeling of hopelessness — and this is the key. One of the ways of doing this is to encourage collective action. Many people have said to me that they feel isolated or that as individuals, they don’t think they can make a worthwhile difference. My answer is always to join a group of like-minded people and to work with them to drive institutional and systemic change. In every case, this has had a galvanizing effect, replacing hopelessness with hope; inertia with action. The bottom line is that many things in life are scary or worrying, from going to the dentist to noticing a potential sign of cancer, but ignoring them almost invariably results in something far worse happening down the line. Climate change is no different. Everyone has the right to know the facts — scary or not — so as to provide the opportunity to act based upon the reality of what we are doing to our planet, and not on some sanitized version. Rather than leading to inaction, I believe this could be transformative."

Here’s what the US missed out on this season",03/08/2024,                                                 The final chapter of winter has been written and it’s the story of a season that didn’t live up to its name.                                             ,"Mary Gilbert and Eric Zerkel, CNN","The final chapter of winter has been written and it’s the story of a season that didn’t live up to its name. This winter was the warmest on record for the Lower 48, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information said Friday. Records date to the late 1800s. The record warmth has left vast areas of the country without typical amounts of snow and ice, fueling a worsening drought in the Midwest and disrupting local economies. It’s another clear signal that global temperatures are on the rise due to human-caused planet-warming emissions. Five of the 10 warmest winters on record in the US have occurred in the last 20 years as winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the country. A normal winter was hard to come by, according to an index from the Midwest Regional Climate Center which tracks the aggregate toll of cold and snow at hundreds of locations across the country. Places with more cold and snow have “severe” or even “extreme” winters as it builds over time, whereas locations with less of both experience mild winters. Dozens of locations have experienced the mildest winter since 1950. Winter warmth started off at a blistering pace. December was the warmest on record for the Lower 48, a full 7.3 degrees Fahrenheit above average. Aside from one brutal cold spell in January, it continued through the season, with February finishing as the third-warmest on record. Unusual February heat wasn’t limited to the US. February was the Earth’s hottest on record, marking the ninth month in a row global records tumbled, according to Copernicus, the European Union’s climate monitoring service. In the US, a classic El Niño pattern had a strong hand in amplifying temperatures, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast where winter felt more like spring. Eight states experienced a record-warm winter: North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire. Temperatures were several degrees above normal in dozens of cities from the north-central US to the Northeast – another clear indicator of exceptional warmth. More than two dozen other states experienced one of their 10-warmest winters on record. It was also one of the 10-warmest winters for many other cities in the northern half of the US, including the entire I-95 corridor from Portland, Maine, to Richmond, Virginia. The prolonged warmth still prevented many heavy snow events in the Northeast and Midwest, creating an ongoing snow drought measured in feet of missing snow. Despite finally ending a years-long wait for substantial snow, New York City and Philadelphia experienced snowfall deficits this winter. It was New York City’s fourth-warmest winter on record and Philadelphia’s sixth-warmest. Areas downwind of the Great Lakes had some of the greatest snowfall deficits due to a lack of lake-effect snow. Without these robust snow events to bulk up totals, Erie, Pennsylvania, missed out on just over five feet of typical winter snow. The lack of snow and ice is having a serious impact on small businesses that rely on it to operate, prompting the governors of Michigan and Minnesota to encourage business owners to seek federal assistance through the Small Business Administration. “From skiing and snowshoeing to winter festivals, snowy winters are part of our way of life in Minnesota,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Waltz said in a news release. “The low precipitation we’ve experienced this winter has had a real economic impact on small businesses that rely on snow and winter tourism to grow and survive.” Significant snowfall deficits and the unusual warmth are also worsening drought conditions in parts of the Midwest. Severe drought expanded over portions of Wisconsin and Michigan and extreme drought increased in Iowa, according to the latest US Drought Monitor. The lack of cold air also shattered chances for prolonged, expansive ice coverage across the Great Lakes. Ice coverage across all five lakes averaged just 5.6% from Jan 1 to March 7, the lowest level since 1973, said James Kessler, a physical scientist at NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab. “That’s fairly remarkable to say,” Kessler told CNN. The lakes usually average 29.5% ice cover from January to early March. This year’s deficit means the lakes are missing enough ice to cover an area roughly the size of West Virginia. The Great Lakes are losing more and more ice as global temperatures rise because of planet-warming emissions. Eight out of the 10 lowest average years for ice coverage have come since 2000, data provided by Kessler showed. CNN’s Laura Paddison and Allison Chinchar contributed to this report."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Summers are becoming increasingly dangerous, especially in cities where the warming effects of tall buildings, concrete and asphalt send temperatures soaring. But there might be a simple, potentially inexpensive way to put a chill on urban heat: retroreflectors. A study published Monday in the journal Nature Cities found when retroreflective material was installed on buildings, it decreased the surface temperature of those buildings by up to 36 degrees Fahrenheit, and air temperatures by nearly 5 degrees. Reducing building temperature is “very, very important” for pedestrians at street level, said Elie Bou-Zeid, co-author of the study and professor of civil and environmental engineering at Princeton University, “because those walls radiate a lot of heat on you.” Cooling those surfaces by 36 degrees “will make you feel significantly more comfortable,” he said. “It’s almost like being in the shade.” Cities are significantly warmer than their surrounding suburbs and rural areas because of the way they are built. Tall buildings, dark roofs, asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s rays and reflect its energy back into the environment as heat – the so-called urban heat island effect. Urban designers have started to implement simple solutions to counteract the urban heat phenomenon, including painting roads white, planting more trees and building green roofs. But researchers say using retroreflective materials would have a more powerful cooling effect. Retroreflectors take advantage of a simple concept: three mirrors in the shape of a cube corner reflect light back in the direction it came from. The same can be achieved with a mirror in the shape of a bowl. They’re used in road signs and bicycle reflectors, for instance, to ensure headlights reflect to drivers’ eyes. They’re also used in running clothes with reflective strips on them. Cats’ eyes have similar, naturally occurring retroreflectors, which is why they appear to glow when you shine a light on them. Bou-Zeid said retroreflective material could be developed as sheets or coatings to install on city surfaces. Given the material itself is relatively inexpensive, it could be a low-cost solution to an increasingly dangerous phenomenon, as temperatures continue to climb due to planet-warming pollution. Small-scale versions of the idea have already been tested in the Netherlands and Italy. But there is no large-scale example yet because of how difficult it is to retrofit existing buildings. “The building industry in general is a little bit slow to adopt new technology,” Bou-Zeid told CNN. “What we were hoping with this paper at least is to show that retroreflective material has a lot of cooling potential. And the next step would be to develop this technology, which already exists, but in buildings.” Some US cities have taken steps to tackle extreme heat. Los Angeles streets were painted with a grayish-white coating to reflect sunlight and keep air temperatures cooler – just like a light shirt will keep you cooler than a dark one in the hot summer sun. But researchers say this solution is less effective than retroreflective material, which reflects sunlight back toward the sun “and not to other objects on the ground,” Bou-Zeid said. There is one downside to it, though: It would make winters feel even colder – reflecting sunlight at a time when it’s beneficial – which could create new public health concerns. Bou-Zeid said it might be possible to design reflective materials that “turn off” when needed. “When it’s very hot during the summer, they become white and reflect a lot back to the sky,” Bou-Zeid said. “When it’s very cold during the winter, they become black and don’t reflect a lot and mostly absorb (the sun’s) energy.” To help reduce the urban impact of the climate crisis, cities need to implement as many measures as they can to adapt to and mitigate these changes, said Xinjie Huang, the lead author of the study and doctoral researcher at Princeton. “It should be noted that retroreflective surface, or any other single heat adaptation strategy, cannot be a ‘silver bullet’ for diverse urban environments worldwide,” Huang told CNN. Instead, “a multi-technology cooling portfolio with cooling techniques tailored to localized conditions is required to combat the exacerbating urban heat stress globally.”"

That 45 states and dozens of cities are either forming new plans or updating their old ones is significant, said Jennifer Macedonia, a deputy assistant administrator at the EPA. “This is quite remarkable and new to have this breadth of coverage,” Macedonia told CNN. “This is quite unprecedented in terms of comprehensive climate action plans across states, and we also have metropolitan areas covering the country as well.” Five states declined to compete for the federal climate funds: Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, South Dakota and Wyoming. But those states have cities and metropolitan areas that raised their hands for the funding, including Jacksonville, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa in Florida; Cedar Rapids and Des Moines in Iowa; Louisville and Lexington in Kentucky; Rapid City in South Dakota; and Cheyenne in Wyoming. Over 96% of the US population will be covered by a climate action plan, Macedonia said, which will both help states track their emissions and submit projects for funding. There are a wide variety of projects states and cities want funding for. Fargo, North Dakota, plans to upgrade most of its inefficient streetlights to LED bulbs, which would save money and cut pollution. The Utah Transit Authority is hoping to use the money to buy 15 electric buses for public transit in Salt Lake County, and to create a new voluntary electric school bus program for schools. And the state of Alabama wants to put more solar panels in rural areas to help power farm irrigation systems. “We’re seeing electricity sector proposals to update the grid and deploy renewable energy, including in Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arizona,” Macedonia said. “For states that have significant agricultural sectors, we’re seeing proposals about sustainable soil management.” But tension around the clean energy transition is still evident in some states’ plans. West Virginia, a state that still relies almost entirely on coal for electricity, has sued the EPA several times to halt regulations that would target coal-fired power plants and heavy industry. The state did not commit to phasing out coal in its plan, but said it would invest in cleaner energy sources like nuclear and hydropower. It also said it intends to focus on preventing leaks of methane, a super-polluting greenhouse gas, from its abandoned coal mines. Many of the states go into remarkable detail on their climate pollution and ways to cut it. In the coming years, states that receive IRA money will be required to demonstrate how they’re using the funds to achieve the climate and energy goals they laid out in their plans. This story has been updated with additional information."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Mars may be around 140 million miles away from Earth, but the red planet is influencing our deep oceans by helping drive “giant whirlpools,” according to new research. Scientists analyzed sediments, drilled from hundreds of deep-sea sites over the past half century, to look back tens of millions of years into Earth’s past, in a quest to better understand the strength of deep ocean currents. What they found surprised them. The sediments revealed that deep-sea currents weakened and strengthened over 2.4 million-year climate cycles, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. Adriana Dutkiewicz, the study’s co-author and sedimentologist at the University of Sydney, said the scientists didn’t expect to discover these cycles, and that there is only one way to explain them: “They are linked to cycles in the interactions of Mars and Earth orbiting the Sun,” she said in a statement. The authors say this is first study to make these connections. The two planets affect each other through a phenomenon called “resonance,” which is when two orbiting bodies apply a gravitational push and pull on each other — sometimes described as a kind of harmonization between distant planets. This interaction changes the shape of their orbits, affecting how close to circular they are and their distance from the sun. For the Earth, this interaction with Mars translates to periods of increased solar energy — meaning a warmer climate — and these warmer cycles correlate with more vigorous ocean currents, the report found. While these 2.4 million-year cycles affect warming and ocean currents on Earth, they are natural climate cycles and not linked to the rapid heating the world is experiencing today as humans continue to burn planet-heating fossil fuels, said Dietmar Müller, professor of geophysics at the University of Sydney and a study co-author. The authors describe these currents, or eddies, as “giant whirlpools” that can reach the bottom of the deep ocean, eroding the seafloor and causing large accumulations of sediments, like snowdrifts. The scientists were able to map these strong eddies through “breaks” in the sediment cores they analyzed. Deep-sea sediments build in continuous layers during calm conditions but strong ocean currents disrupt this, leaving a visible stamp of their existence. Because satellite data that can visibly map changes in ocean circulation has only been available for a few decades, sediment cores — which help to build a picture of the past going back millions of years — are very useful for understanding circulation changes in a warmer climate, Müller told CNN. If today’s human-caused warming continues on its current trajectory, Müller said, “this effect will dwarf all other processes for a long time to come. But the geological record still provides us with valuable insights about how the oceans operate in a warmer world.” The authors suggest it is possible that these eddies could even help mitigate some of the impacts of a potential collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a crucial ocean circulation which works like a huge conveyor belt transporting warm water from the tropics to the far North Atlantic. Scientists have been increasingly sounding the alarm about the health of this critical system of currents. There are fears it may even be showing early signs it is on course to collapse, as global warming heats up oceans and melts ice, disrupting the delicate balance of heat and salt that determines the AMOC’s strength. A collapse would have catastrophic climate consequences, including temperatures plunging rapidly in some places and rising in others. “Our work does not say anything about what may or may not happen to AMOC,” Müller said. “Our point is, rather, that even if AMOC were to shut down, there are still other processes to mix the ocean, even though their effects would be quite different.” There are fears that an AMOC shutdown would mean oxygen-rich surface waters would no longer mix with deeper waters, leading to a stagnant ocean largely devoid of life. “Our results suggest that more intense deep-ocean eddies in a warmer world may prevent such ocean stagnation,” he said Joel Hirschi, associate head of marine systems modeling at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK, who was not involved in the research, said the study’s finding of the existence of a 2.4 million-year cycle in sea sediments was noteworthy. The methodology is sound and a link with Mars is possible, he added. But, he told CNN, the “proposed link with the ocean circulation is speculative and the evidence that deep ocean circulation linked to eddies is stronger in warm climates is thin.” Satellite observations have shown that these eddies have become more active in the last decades but the currents don’t always reach the bottom of the ocean, he said, meaning they would not be able to prevent sediment build-up. It remains unclear exactly how different processes affecting deep-ocean currents and marine life will play out in the future, the study’s authors said in a statement, but they hope this new study will help build better model future climate outcomes."

Gusts up to 50 mph are possible into Wednesday night as the potent storm takes shape. These winds, in combination with warm, dry weather, and abundant dry grasses and other plant fuel, have raised the fire weather risk to its most extreme level – Level 3 of 3 – in parts of Texas and Oklahoma. Fire weather conditions are at Level 2 of 3 Wednesday for a larger portion of Texas, Oklahoma and parts of Kansas and New Mexico. The area most at risk was devastated by fast-moving wildfires in late February and early March, including Texas’ largest fire on record, the Smokehouse Creek Fire. “Dangerous fire weather conditions are likely and an outbreak of wildfires is possible,” the Storm Prediction Center said. If a fire starts, the dry fuels will quickly go up in flames and allow it to burn rapidly through anything it can reach, supporting a “large fire spread,” the center said. The Smokehouse Creek Fire burned through over 1 million acres of Texas land in just a couple of days. Winds are likely to fall just short of the ferocious 60 to 70 mph that drove that fire, but fires will still be able to spread quickly in similarly dry conditions. “We continue to strongly urge everyone to do their part and help prevent wildfires,” the National Weather Service in Amarillo, Texas, urged Wednesday. Officials urge residents to follow any burn bans in effect, avoid parking vehicles with hot engines on dry grass and to properly dispose of cigarettes. The wildfire risk will drop considerably on Thursday as winds ease. Around the same time the wildfire risk is peaking late Wednesday afternoon in portions of the southern US, rain and a few thunderstorms will change over to snow in the Rockies and won’t stop until Friday. Snow will fall from Wyoming to Arizona and New Mexico, but Colorado will be in the bull’s-eye. Feet of snow are possible in the state’s highest elevations. Snowfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour are possible starting late Wednesday afternoon or evening, according to the National Weather Service in Denver. But heavy snow will not be confined to mountain peaks. Denver could record the most snow in three years as 12 to 18 inches are possible. Over 20 inches could pile up in the far western portion of the metro area, close to the Front Range foothills. March is typically the snowiest month of the year for Denver, but this storm could bring  more than an entire month’s worth of snow in just three days. The heaviest snow for Denver is likely to fall from Wednesday night through Thursday when snowfall rates could reach 1 to 2 inches per hour at times. Travel is expected to become difficult within this window and could be nearly impossible in and near the foothills. Snowfall will begin to ease late Thursday and slowly come to an end Friday across the Rockies. The same storm system and atmospheric energy that will bury Colorado in snow and elevate dangerous fire weather in Texas and Oklahoma will also ignite a round of severe thunderstorms Wednesday and Thursday. Severe thunderstorms are forecast to rumble to life late Wednesday afternoon in portions of the Plains and Mississippi Valley and track into the Midwest through Wednesday night. The strongest storms will center over northeastern Kansas and western Missouri, including Kansas City, where a Level 3 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms is in place, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A larger portion of Kansas and Missouri, as well as parts of Nebraska and Iowa, are under a Level 2 of 5 risk. Large hail, damaging wind gusts, drenching rainfall and even a few tornadoes are all possible within severe thunderstorms through Wednesday night. The greatest tornado threat will center on parts of Kansas and Missouri, including cities like Topeka, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri. A few severe thunderstorms may also fire up in parts of Oklahoma and northeastern Texas late Wednesday afternoon, but the overall threat is more isolated than areas farther north. Thursday will unleash a much more expansive severe threat from the southern Plains into the Great Lakes as the storm system pushes east. An area stretching from Texas to Illinois and Indiana will be under a Level 2 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms able to produce damaging wind gusts, hail and a few tornadoes. A higher Level 3 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms will center on parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri. The risk for tornadoes will also be highest in this area. The overall severe threat will ease on Friday, but isolated severe thunderstorms are possible along the Gulf Coast."

Not only did Great Lakes ice cover reach historic lows last month, it was also the warmest February on record for North America and Europe, disrupting local economies that rely on winter recreational activities such as skiing and snowboarding. Meanwhile, parts of the planet also saw water-related disasters on both ends of the spectrum — dry and wet. As Ecuador and Madagascar faced heavy rainfall and destructive flooding, parts of southern Africa saw one of the driest Februarys in 40 years. Correction: A previous version of this story misstated how low Antarctic sea ice was last month.

","Allison Chinchar, Sara Tonks and Mary Gilbert, CNN","After weeks of spring-like warmth, parts of the United States will briefly plunge back into winter this week, with below-freezing temperatures possible for much of the eastern half of the country. Tuesday marks the official start of astronomical spring in the Northern Hemisphere after the warmest winter on record. But it seems Mother Nature has the seasons mixed up, because spring will feel more like winter early this week. More than half the US population will experience temperatures at or below freezing. The cold isn’t just an anomaly, it will pose a risk for agricultural interests in the Southeast with the growing season underway there. Freeze warnings stretch from Texas to North Carolina because of the risk to crops. The chilly weather will be a shock for many in the eastern half of the country experiencing warmer than average temperatures this past week. Many southern cities had highs in the 70s on Saturday – but that changed Sunday as cold crept into the Midwest and progressed south and east. Colder air has become widespread across much of the eastern half of the country Monday and will keep most of the region quite chilly Tuesday. St Louis could see more than a 20-degree swing from the high 60s Saturday to the low 40s Monday. Atlanta’s high temperature could drop by as much as 15 degrees from Saturday to Monday, from the low 70s to the mid-50s. These temperatures might not be frigid, but in parts of the South they’re more typical for the heart of winter. Memphis, Tennessee, and Huntsville, Alabama, are both forecast to see a high temperature around 50 degrees on Monday – more typical for mid-January. The cold air will continue to spread east Monday night into Tuesday, finally reaching much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. New York City will drop from a high of 61 degrees Saturday to the mid-40s Tuesday. Philadelphia’s high temperature on Tuesday is expected to be in the upper 40s, more typical of late February. Low temperatures will also be dropping. Temperatures in the Southeast Tuesday morning will be 10 to 15 degrees below normal for this time of the year. Atlanta, Charlotte, and Birmingham, Alabama, are all expected to see temperatures drop into the low 30s Tuesday morning, presenting the greatest risk to plants. The timing of this potential freeze is not out of the ordinary. Birmingham, Alabama, and Atlanta experienced their final freeze right around the spring equinox last year. But the threat to plant life is more substantial given the warmth preceding it. “Frost and freeze conditions will kill crops, other sensitive vegetation and possibly damage unprotected outdoor plumbing,” the National Weather Service in Atlanta said. Bringing plants indoors is the easiest way to protect them from a hard freeze, but if you can’t do that, covering them can also help. Sheets, towels or blankets can be used to help trap the radiant heat from the ground around the plants. Use stakes with your plant coverings or drape them over patio furniture so they don’t crush the plant. Temperatures will rebound rather quickly across the Southeast by the end of the week, so hang on to that sunscreen and allergy medicine, as spring will be in full swing shortly."

","Helen Regan, CNN","All but one of the 100 cities with the world’s worst air pollution last year were in Asia, according to a new report, with the climate crisis playing a pivotal role in bad air quality that is risking the health of billions of people worldwide. The vast majority of these cities — 83 — were in India and all exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines by more than 10 times, according to the report by IQAir, which tracks air quality worldwide. The study looked specifically at fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, which is the tiniest pollutant but also the most dangerous. Only 9% of more than 7,800 cities analyzed globally recorded air quality that met WHO’s standard, which says average annual levels of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms per cubic meter. “We see that in every part of our lives that air pollution has an impact,” said IQAir Global CEO Frank Hammes. “And it typically, in some of the most polluted countries, is likely shaving off anywhere between three to six years of people’s lives. And then before that will lead to many years of suffering that are entirely preventable if there’s better air quality.” When inhaled, PM2.5 travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, cancer, and other respiratory illnesses, as well as cognitive impairment in children. Begusarai, a city of half a million people in northern India’s Bihar state, was the world’s most polluted city last year with an average annual PM2.5 concentration of 118.9 — 23 times the WHO guidelines. It was followed in the IQAir rankings by the Indian cities of Guwahati, Assam; Delhi; and Mullanpur, Punjab. Across India, 1.3 billion people, or 96% of the population, live with air quality seven times higher than WHO guidelines, according to the report. Central and South Asia were the worst performing regions globally, home to all four of the most polluted countries last year: Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Tajikistan. South Asia is of particular concern, with 29 of the 30 most polluted cities in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. The report ranked the major population centers of Lahore in 5th, New Delhi in 6th and Dhaka in 24th place. Hammes said no significant improvement in pollution levels in the region is likely without “major changes in terms of the energy infrastructure and agricultural practices.” “What’s also worrisome in many parts of the world is that the things that are causing outdoor air pollution are also sometimes the things that are causing indoor air pollution,” he added. “So cooking with dirty fuel will create indoor exposures that could be many times what you’re seeing outdoors.” IQAir found that 92.5% of the 7,812 locations in 134 countries, regions, and territories where it analyzed average air quality last year exceeded WHO’s PM2.5 guidelines. Only 10 countries and territories had “healthy” air quality: Finland, Estonia, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, Bermuda, Grenada, Iceland, Mauritius and French Polynesia. Millions of people die each year from air pollution-related health issues. Air pollution from fossil fuels is killing 5.1 million people worldwide every year, according to a study published in the BMJ in November. Meanwhile, WHO says 6.7 million people die annually from the combined effects of ambient and household air pollution. The human-caused climate crisis, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, plays a “pivotal” role in influencing air pollution levels, the IQAir report said. The climate crisis is altering weather patterns, leading to changes in wind and rainfall, which affects the dispersion of pollutants. Climate change will only make pollution worse as extreme heat becomes more severe and frequent, it said. The climate crisis is also leading to more severe wildfires in many regions and longer and more intense pollen seasons, both of which exacerbate health issues linked to air pollution. “We have such a strong overlap of what’s causing our climate crisis and what’s causing air pollution,” Hammes said. “Anything that we can do to reduce air pollution will be tremendously impactful in the long term also for improving our climate gas emissions, and vice versa.” North America was badly affected by wildfires that raged in Canada from May to October last year. In May, the monthly average of air pollution in Alberta was nine times greater than the same month in 2022, the report found. And for the first time, Canada surpassed the United States in the regional pollution rankings. The wildfires also affected US cities such as Minneapolis and Detroit, where annual pollution averages rose by 30% to 50% compared to the previous year. The most polluted major US city in 2023 was Columbus, Ohio for the second year running. But major cities like Portland, Seattle and Los Angeles experienced significant drops in annual average pollution levels, the report said. In Asia, however, pollution levels rebounded across much of the region. China reversed a five-year trend of declining levels of pollution, the report found. Chinese cities used to dominate global rankings of the world’s worst air quality but a raft of clean air policies over the past decade has transformed things for the better. A study last year had found the campaign meant the average Chinese citizen’s lifespan is now 2.2 years longer. But thick smog returned to Beijing last year, where citizens experienced a 14% increase in the annual average PM2.5 concentration, according to the IQAir report. China’s most polluted city, Hotan, was listed at 14 in the IQAir ranking. In Southeast Asia, only the Philippines saw a drop in annual pollution levels compared to the previous year, the report found. Indonesia was the most polluted country in the region, with a 20% increase compared to 2022. Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand all had cities that exceeded WHO PM2.5 guidelines by more than 10 times, according to the report. Last month, Thai authorities ordered government employees to work from home due to unhealthy levels of pollution in the capital Bangkok and surrounding areas, according to Reuters. On Friday, tourism hot spot Chiang Mai was the world’s most polluted city as toxic smog brought by seasonal agricultural burning blanketed the northern city. The report also highlighted a worrying inequality: the lack of monitoring stations in countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, which results in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. Although Africa saw an improvement in the number of countries included in this year’s report compared with previous years the continent largely remains the most underrepresented. According to IQAir, only 24 of 54 African countries had sufficient data available from their monitoring stations. Seven African countries were among the new locations included in the 2023 rankings, including Burkina Faso, the world’s fifth most polluted country, and Rwanda, in 15th. Several countries that ranked high on the most polluted list last year were not included for 2023 due to a lack of available data. They include Chad, which was the most polluted country in 2022. “There is so much hidden air pollution still on the planet,” said Hammes. One bright spot is increasing pressure and civic engagement from communities, NGOs, companies, and scientists to monitor air quality. “Ultimately that’s great because it really shows governments that people do care,” Hammes said."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","The world’s oceans have now experienced an entire year of unprecedented heat, with a new temperature record broken every day, new data shows. Global ocean surface temperatures started breaking daily records in mid-March last year, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, fueling concerns for marine life and extreme weather across the planet. “The amplitude by which previous sea surface temperature records were beaten in 2023, and now again in 2024, is remarkable,” said Joel Hirschi, associate head of marine systems modeling at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK. Global average ocean temperatures in 2023 were 0.25 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous year, said Gregory C. Johnson, a NOAA oceanographer. That rise is “is equivalent to about two decades’ worth of warming in a single year,” he told CNN. “So it is quite large, quite significant, and a bit surprising.” Scientists have said ocean heat is being supercharged by human-caused global warming, boosted by El Niño, a natural climate pattern marked by higher-than-average ocean temperatures. The main consequences are on marine life and global weather. Global ocean warmth can add more power to hurricanes and other extreme weather events, including scorching heat waves and intense rainfall. High ocean temperatures are already proving catastrophic for coral. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is experiencing its seventh mass bleaching event, authorities announced in March following aerial surveys. Bleaching occurs when heat-stressed corals release the algae that live in their tissue and provide their food source. If ocean temperatures remain too high for too long, the coral can starve and die. Data from NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch tool shows that the problem goes well beyond Australia, and that the world could face a fourth global mass coral bleaching event in the next few months. Ocean heat sets the stage for more ferocious hurricanes. “The warmer the ocean, the more energy to fuel storms is available,” said Karina von Schuckmann, an oceanographer at Mercator Ocean International in France. Temperatures have been unprecedented in the North Atlantic, an area of ocean key to hurricane formation, surprising some scientists, who are still trying to unpick the exact causes. “At times, the records (in the North Atlantic) have been broken by margins that are virtually statistically impossible,” Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School told CNN. If very high ocean temperatures continue into the second half of 2024 and a La Niña event develops — El Niño’s counterpart that tends to amplify Atlantic hurricane season — “this would increase the risk of a very active hurricane season,” Hirschi said. About 90% of the world’s excess heat produced by burning planet-heating fossil fuels is stored in the oceans. “Measuring ocean warming allows us to track the status and evolution of planetary warming,” Schuckmann told CNN. “The ocean is the sentinel for global warming.” El Niño is weakening and predicted to dissipate over the next few months, which could level off the record ocean temperatures, especially if the cooling effects of La Niña replace it. “In the past, surface temperature values have decreased after the passage of El Niño,” Schuckmann said. But, she added, it’s currently impossible to predict when ocean heat will drop below record levels. While natural climate variability will cause ocean temperatures to fluctuate, over the long term, NOAA’s Johnson said, we should expect them to “continue to break records as long as greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise.” CNN’s Derek Van Dam contributed to this report."

Visible from space. The world’s biggest energy plant. Enough electricity to power Switzerland. The scale of the project transforming swathes of barren salt desert on the edge of western India into one of the most important sources of clean energy anywhere on the planet is so overwhelming that the man in charge can’t keep up. “I don’t even do the math any more,” Sagar Adani told CNN in an interview last week. Adani is executive director of Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL). He’s also the nephew of Gautam Adani, Asia’s second richest man, whose $100 billion fortune stems from the Adani Group, India’s biggest coal importer and a leading miner of the dirty fuel. Founded in 1988, the conglomerate has businesses in fields ranging from ports and thermal power plants to media and cements. Its clean energy unit AGEL is building the sprawling solar and wind power plant in the western Indian state of Gujarat at a cost of about $20 billion. It will be the world’s biggest renewable park when it is finished in about five years, and should generate enough clean electricity to power 16 million Indian homes. The success of the Khavda Renewable Energy Park is critical to India’s efforts to reduce pollution and hit its climate goals while meeting the burgeoning energy needs of the world’s most populous nation and fastest-growing major economy. Coal still accounts for 70% of the electricity India generates. Situated just 12 miles from one of the world’s most dangerous borders separating India and Pakistan, the park will cover more than 200 square miles and be the planet’s largest power plant regardless of the energy source, AGEL said. “A region so large, a region that is so unencumbered, there’s no wildlife, there’s no vegetation, there’s no habitation. There is no better alternative use of that land,” said Adani. The group’s big green plans haven’t been dented by the turbulent year it has had since January 2023, when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of engaging in fraud over decades. The Indian mining-to-media conglomerate denounced Hindenburg’s report as “baseless” and “malicious.” But that failed to halt a stunning stock market meltdown that, at one point, wiped more than $100 billion off the value of its listed companies. Gautam Adani’s personal fortune was also hammered, collapsing by more than $80 billion in the month following the release of the report. But the tycoon has since bounced back and the group is now pouring billions into the clean energy sector. It plans to invest $100 billion into energy transition over the next decade, with 70% of the investments ear-marked for clean energy. Adani Group’s clean energy pivot comes at a time when India has set itself some ambitious climate goals. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised that renewable sources such as solar and wind power will fulfil 50% of India’s energy requirements by the end of this decade. In 2021, Modi pledged India would achieve net zero emissions by 2070, which is still a couple of decades later than developed economies. The government has set a target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of non-fossil fuel electricity generating capacity by 2030. AGEL, the country’s largest renewable energy company, aims to provide at least 9% of that, with nearly 30 GW generated from its Khavda park in Gujarat alone. Failing to transition to renewable energy is not an option, said Adani. “There is no choice for India but to start doing things at a previously unimagined size and scale,” the 30-year-old said. That’s because energy demand is going to explode in the coming years. India is the world’s third-largest energy consuming country, although its energy use and emissions per person are less than half the world average, data from the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) shows. That could change rapidly. Thanks to rising incomes, energy demand has doubled since 2000, with 80% of it still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass. Over the next three decades, the rapidly-expanding economy will see the largest energy demand growth of any country in the world, the IEA said. “If India does what China did, if India does what Europe did, if India does what the US did, then we are all in for a very, very bleak climatic future,” said Adani, referring to the historic use of fossil fuels as those countries developed. His dire predictions are not dramatic. India is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, analysts say, and may become the world’s third largest economy before the end of this decade. As it develops and modernizes, its urban population will shoot up, leading to a massive rise in the construction of homes, offices, shops and other buildings. According to analysts, India is set to add the equivalent of a London to its urban population every year for the next 30 years. Electricity demand is expected to skyrocket in the coming years because of factors ranging from improved living standards to climate change. The latter has been fueling deadly heatwaves across India, and as a result, air conditioner ownership is set to see a sharp spike in the coming years. By 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners is set to exceed the total energy consumption in the whole of Africa today, the IEA said. India cannot rely on fossil fuels for its burgeoning needs without disastrous consequences for efforts to tackle the climate crisis. “If you imagine 800 GW of coal-fired thermal capacity being added … this by itself will kill all other sustainable energy initiatives happening all across the world, in terms of carbon emissions,” said Adani. The conglomerate’s green plans are impressive, but climate experts are critical of its continued massive investments in fossil fuels. “[Gautam] Adani continues to walk both sides of the street,” said Tim Buckley, director of Sydney-based think tank Climate Energy Finance. The Adani Group is not only one of the largest developers and operators of coal mines in India, but also operates the controversial Carmichael Coal Mine in Australia, which has faced fierce opposition from climate change campaigners who say it is a “death sentence” for the Great Barrier Reef. “Rather than ploughing billions into new fossil fuel projects, India would be far better served if Adani put 100% of its efforts and resources into developing low-cost zero emissions technologies,” Buckley added. That is not an option at the moment, said Adani. More than 600 million people in India will be “coming into middle income and upper income over the next decade, decade and a half,” he said. “They cannot be deprived of basic needs of energy. ” Everyone would be happy if we could “have a 100% of that being provided from sustainable energy sources …[but]… practically, that’s not an option” at the moment, he added. He also said that activists in developed nations, which have historically emitted more greenhouse gases, are often unable to understand the staggering challenge facing India to grow its economy and its clean energy industry at the same time. “I think it’s also very important to respect the fact that every country has its own right to make sure that the people of their own country are well-served from an energy perspective,” Adani said. “So is India doing a bit of coal? Yes, of course India is. But is India doing a massive amount of renewables? Yes, there’s no question,” he added"

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","It looks like Mother Nature has her seasons mixed up as a potent, far-reaching storm gears up to unload snow, ice and severe thunderstorms on the central US this weekend. In a seasonal role-reversal, back-to-back storms are sending some cities as much snow as they had all winter. The first storm dropped several inches of snow from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes, beginning Thursday night and continuing into Friday morning. Snowfall totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches over the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area during that time. Snow will persist through Friday evening over the Great Lakes before the quick-moving storm slides into the Northeast on Saturday. The second storm will arrive in the central US on Sunday. This encore is expected to outperform its predecessor, ushering in widespread, troublesome and longer-lasting impacts. “Disruptions to daily life” are likely as a result of this storm, the Weather Prediction Center warned on Friday. Snow is likely to spread from the northern Rockies to the Midwest on Sunday as the storm moves from the Rockies into the Plains and strengthens. Winds will become quite gusty as the storm grows. Blowing snow could create very poor visibility, affecting travel on the ground and in the air. Widespread snowfall totals of over half a foot are likely in multiple north-central states. Over a foot of snow is possible where the heaviest snow centers. This far in advance, it’s difficult to say exactly where these highest totals will occur, but the Dakotas and Minnesota could end up in the bull’s-eye. Snow will continue to bury the northern US as the storm pushes east on Monday. Minneapolis received less than a foot of snow from December through February – 2 feet short of what a typical winter brings. But what it got over the course of three months may be matched – or exceeded – in a matter of days. A similar scenario could play out in Fargo, North Dakota, and Aberdeen, South Dakota. Sleet and freezing rain will further complicate the snowfall forecast and travel concerns Sunday and Monday. In Iowa, precipitation could start out as snow on Sunday before mixing with sleet and turning over to rain on Monday. The opposite could occur in Nebraska, where Sunday rain could morph into an icy mix and eventually snow on Monday. Ice buildup could make travel treacherous or weigh down power lines to their breaking point. Unlike the first quick-hitting storm, the storm arriving early next week will create hazards beyond snow. Cold air trailing behind the wide-reaching storm’s cold front will clash with warm, moist air in place over the South and produce severe thunderstorms Sunday and Monday. The risk on Sunday will affect areas from Texas through Kansas. Damaging thunderstorms are expected to fire up late Sunday afternoon from central Texas to central Kansas and track slowly eastward through the evening. Wind gusts in excess of 60 mph, hail bigger than quarters and a few tornadoes are possible. The bull’s-eye of severe thunderstorm risk will shift east on Monday and capture parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast. Hazardous thunderstorm activity could get underway by Monday afternoon from Texas to Arkansas and expand in scope as storms track east through the evening hours. Severe hazards are once again possible Monday. Thunderstorms will rumble across the South on Tuesday, but the threat for widespread damaging storms appears to be limited."

","Rachel Ramirez and Elisa Raffa, CNN","Peach trees are blooming at Jaemor Farms in Alto, Georgia, this week. It’s a stark contrast from last year, when an abnormally warm winter followed by freezing temperatures destroyed a significant amount of the state’s favorite fruit. Owner Drew Echols, a fifth-generation farmer, said it has become harder to predict when fruits like the iconic Georgia peaches would start blooming. Like many growers, he’s had to resort to creative and strategic measures, such as trying out new fruit varieties or using wind machines to control the air temperature, to protect his crops. “The biggest worry that a farmer, especially a peach producer, faces is always the weather,” Echols told CNN. “You’re always looking at that forecast every single day, planning work and praying and hoping that you’re going to have a good crop.” As the climate crisis creates warmer winters and early springs, peaches and many fruit crops, including plums, apples and apricots are at risk. Warmer winters mean earlier blooms, and a sudden dip in temperatures during the season could damage or kill the fruits, drastically affecting the amount harvested for the year. Last year, Georgia lost more than 90% of the peach crop after an abnormally warm winter caused trees to bloom too early. The Peach State typically produces more than 130 million pounds of peaches annually, a haul that in 2021 was valued at nearly $85 million. While this year is turning out to be better than last, Echols fears another major loss. “As we see the climate changing, we see these more erratic events,” Louise Ferguson, professor of cooperative extension at the plant sciences department of the University of California, Davis, told CNN. Swings in temperatures, with overall warmer conditions, are becoming more common. The bottom line, Ferguson says: “You will see more climate-related events affecting the availability of your fruits.” This winter was the warmest on record since data-keeping began in the late 1800s for the Lower 48 US states, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Aside from one brutal cold snap in January, the winter warmth continued throughout the season. But then this week, parts of the country briefly saw temperatures drop below freezing, making the first few days of spring — and the Southeast growing season — feel a lot like winter. “What the USDA Climate Hub is showing is that the weather is overall warmer, but the place that is the most erratic in terms of really high highs and low lows, like 50-degree changes within a couple of days, is in the spring,” Dorothy Suput, a Boston-based agricultural consultant and senior fellow at the Croatan Institute, told CNN. This is a challenge for the flowers that turn into fruits, said Benjamin Cook, climate scientist at Columbia University and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “If you have a really intense frost event that damages an orchard, then the trees can lose those flowers,” Cook told CNN. “As a consequence, they oftentimes won’t replace them, and you’ll wind up with a much lower harvest than you otherwise would have had.” That’s what happened in Georgia and other parts of the country last year. New Hampshire apple growers also struggled to protect their early-bloomed fruits from a frost last year. By mid-May, most of the apples in orchards were severely damaged — saps frozen, insides blackened and fruit cells ultimately destroyed. “If there’s freezing in the cells, that’s a slightly deeper freeze, it tears the membranes apart and it damages the structure of the fruit and it can’t grow,” Ferguson said. Growing fruits require a certain number of “chill hours,” ranging between 32 degrees and 45 degrees Fahrenheit. The cold allows the crops to go into dormancy, much like people need sleep. The fruits begin to bloom as temperatures warm, but when a cold spell comes back, they become susceptible to damage. “In New England last year, because it was really warm, the trees started flowering or setting their buds,” Suput said. “But then it dropped to like crazy cold weather, which killed what would become the fruit.” As a result, Suput said there were barely any fruits at most local farmer’s markets. Fruits like peaches, strawberries, mangoes and plums typically reach their peak ripeness during the summer months. However, experts say the sudden shifts in weather may soon change that. Research shows erratic weather events like extreme heat, drought and sudden freezes can stress fruit trees, which can affect the plant’s sugar content, acidity and overall flavor. Some fruits can lack freshness and become less sweet or tarty under stress. Other fruits can even see changes in color. As farmers encounter more of these climate change-fueled erratic weather patterns, Suput said many are trying to find solutions — whether that’s tapping into new fruit varieties to offset the impacted yield or finding new ways to protect crops. At Jaemor Farms, for example, peaches aren’t the only fruits under threat. Against the backdrop of 150 acres of pink peach blooms lies a white tarp blanketing another crop of summer staple: strawberries. Jaemor’s 18-acre strawberry field is tucked under heavy blankets to protect them from the cold. “Our entire food system is at risk,” Suput said. “It’s about figuring out what we can do differently and learn from other people, rather than trying to hold on tight to the tried-and-true ways that have worked for many years, but what that looks like I’m not sure people know yet.”"

Wolf, CNN","A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Although many Americans and policy wonks see climate change as the major existential issue of our time, it ends up feeling like a relatively small piece of the American political conversation, which is more focused on the economy, immigration and democracy. The climate crisis ends up touching on all of those issues, as CNN’s chief climate correspondent Bill Weir told me. His new book, “Life As We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate and Hope in a Changing World,” comes out on April 16. We talked on the phone about his recent trip to Massachusetts, where some beachfront homeowners who want the state to do more to help protect the area from erosion and rising sea levels also deny the climate is in crisis. My conversation with Weir, edited for clarity, is below: WOLF: You’re on the ground covering the climate crisis every day. Where has that taken you recently? WEIR: To both ends of the spectrum. It’s the grim reality of what’s unfolding and also, we’re working on a special on innovation. Most recently, I was in Salisbury, Massachusetts, on the New Hampshire border where folks there, over the generations, have watched the high tide get higher, year by year. As is the case along the Atlantic coast, erosion is accelerating along with sea level rise. And so this year, over 100 homeowners banded together, spent $600,000 on 15,000 tons of sand in order to fortify their beachside homes from storms and higher tides. In years past, that would last them three or four years, but then they got yet another freak storm and high tide and most of it was washed away in a single day. They’re coming to grips in various forms with the five stages of climate grief. They very much want the state to kick in. I met some neighbors who refuse to acknowledge climate science and just believe that this is a string of bad luck, a one-off series of unfortunate events. Others are coming around to the to the idea and the actual scientific warnings that Massachusetts is bracing for, officially, a couple of feet of sea level rise above year 2000 levels just in the next decade or two. This was a fascinating case study in the psychology about it, and how people who don’t really acknowledge the warnings of science are the ones most dedicated to saving what’s there now, and so are a vital part of bracing for what’s unfolding. WEIR: I went down to Florida and met with a couple of inspirational developers. One is Syd Kitson, a former NFL player, who built the first solar power town in America. It’s called Babcock Ranch, Florida. I was riding out Hurricane Ian a few miles away where everything was plunged into darkness and flooded. But because of his designs and ideas, they never lost power and never flooded, and as a result, the demand for people to buy homes in Babcock Ranch has skyrocketed. He’s building them as fast as he can. And so I’m looking at glimpses into how the climate crisis is already changing neighborhoods and which direction we’re likely to go when it comes to construction and food supplies and energy. It’s all changing incredibly fast – an industrial revolution that nobody’s talking about. WOLF: You did another story recently about Buffalo as a landing spot for climate refugees. I think it’s interesting that on the one hand, you’re talking to people who are making it so that we can withstand climate change in Florida, but then also thinking about where people are eventually going to have to move because of climate change. How far out is the horizon where we actually see people moving away from the Sunbelt because that’s where people have been moving to for so long? WEIR: It’s a fascinating question for different reasons. Five thousand people who were driven out of Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria went to Buffalo for refuge because there’s a Puerto Rican community there; 3,000 of them stayed. The city embraced that. They need folks to revitalize these Rust Belt towns, and they have a ton of fresh water and clean energy with Niagara Falls. So they’ve declared themselves a climate refuge. For them, it’s not just the latitude, it’s the attitude around migration. At the same time, for the first time in human history, sun and wind energy are the cheapest forms of energy. And so the sun belts, now we’re gonna think of them as the solar belts, and the wind belts, the high plains of Texas, are going to be a huge magnet for big manufacturing who need a lot of abundant energy. Texas now leads the nation in clean energy just because of the economics, despite the politics and ideology. Bright-red Texas is the greenest state right now. The math, the economics of it, is going to change the landscape of what attracts companies, and then as a result, what attracts workers. But ultimately, the heat is going to win. As the belly on the planet becomes more intolerable, the northern latitudes become that much more attractive. Alaska could be the new Florida for retirees. It’ll be a lot wetter up there. But the band of the United States from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, across the Great Lakes is a refuge that is best positioned for that. The UN predicts tens of millions of folks forced to cross borders by sudden, unnatural disasters. You can see what’s happening on the border now. And as droughts get worse in Central America, you can just play it out. The strain is going to go up. WOLF: It’s interesting to hear you say that about Texas, because the governor and the Republican-dominated legislature there would seemingly be opposed to doing anything specifically because of climate change. But if there’s a capitalist urge, people seem more in tune with it. Joe Biden has tried to make the argument that addressing climate change should be an economic boom. Do you think that even if people are unwilling to accept that climate change is happening, they still might be doing things to address it? WEIR: Oh, absolutely. A story that I don’t get to tell enough is just this massive boom in renewables and clean energy and clean water tech. I think the most recent analysis was for every dollar spent by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, five-and-a-half bucks in private investment has chased that. And there are these massive growth rates in the sectors that people aren’t talking about – carbon removal, thermal storage, using big boxes of hot rocks to store clean energy, using the earth as a battery through pressure, geothermal – all of these things are exploding now. At the same time, the United States is the biggest petrostate in human history. Joe Biden has exported much more fossil fuels than Donald Trump. It’s the result of this big boom in fracked natural gas. That’s a big sticking point with the environmental wing of his base. The big question is how much this new energy boom replaces the old, dirty kind of energy or if we just are so ravenous in our appetites; humanity never cuts back. In places like Charleston (South Carolina), where they’re building a billion dollar seawall, and people are raising their 100-year-old mansions on the Battery, it’s not a political debate. It is reality. The physics are right there in your face. Matt Yglesias is among others who have said we shouldn’t talk too much about climate at all. Because the average person, when it comes to actual action, daily action, doesn’t really want to do it. WOLF: I’ve wondered about that with regard to electric vehicles. It seems like some people are turned off by them because it’s making a political statement when you buy an EV instead of simply trying to get the best deal. WEIR: I think what you’re seeing now is there’s been such sudden market saturation that now there’s a backlash, there’s a glut or an oversupply. These things happen in fits and starts. Offshore wind was super exciting. And then it hit inflation headwinds and supply chain problems. EVs were a novelty and a statement. And now there’s a tyranny of choice. There’s so many different models and sorting out all the incentives is still not easy. At the same time, we’ve crossed the point that I don’t think we’re going back to the internal combustion engine, as a species, the same way there was a certain point we weren’t going back to horses. It just makes more sense. Electrifying everything is the ultimate result, I think, of all this. It’s just a matter of how fast it takes. Look at these S-shaped curves of adaptation in history from the color television to the refrigerator that went from, you know, 10% of homes to 95% in a relatively short amount of time. We’ve seen that same thing with solar and battery storage, the same kind of thing with heat pumps. And there’s a big wave of efficiency and cleaner, more sustainable choices coming, regardless of the politics. WOLF: I read in CNN’s report that it was the warmest winter on record and that the planet was more than 2 degrees over the pre-industrial levels for a number of days in February. It seems clear that we’re going to burst through the 2-degree tipping point that had been previously suggested as the tipping point for climate change. What is the next marker? WEIR: The hardest thing for most folks to grasp – I still have a hard time grasping it even though I live in the space every day – is that the record-shattering year that we just had isn’t just the hottest year in 120,000 years or so. It’s among the coolest years of the rest of our lives. And there has been no meaningful reduction in emissions. The human hand on the global thermostat still has it cranked all the way up. And until that changes, until the atmosphere stabilizes at a certain rate, it’s just going to keep getting warmer. The really scary stuff is what we don’t see and what’s much harder to measure and to communicate, which is that the ocean temperatures have broken a record every day for the last year. Every new day on the calendar is the hottest such day that we’ve ever recorded. What that means for marine ecosystems and coral reefs, which are the cradles of life in the oceans, and what it means for the power of storms as we head into hurricane season has scientists really, really worried. WOLF: What are the little things that people should be doing? I don’t think anybody’s realistically asking people to stop travel completely. You travel to cover these stories. How do you layer the climate into your daily life? WEIR: When you take on this beat, you see everything in life differently. I used to just see an ice cream truck and smile. Now I see the fumes coming off the generator. I think about the sugarcane fields that burn to make delicious treats. Everything has a cost if you really think about it. I absolutely think about my flight footprint and for years would offset my air miles with clean energy projects that are vetted, charities I believe in. But we can’t offset our way out of this problem. We have to come up with a way to fly sustainably, and we have to figure out a way to build our homes and source our food and make our clothing in much more efficient and sensible ways. On the personal responsibility part of it, I do my best. I haven’t owned a car in a few years. I’m proud to say I have almost 4,000 miles on Citi Bikes (New York’s bike-share service), but I just like riding a bike. I’m not doing that to be some sort of Captain Planet statement maker; I just liked that way of getting around New York City. If I lived in Dallas or Chicago, it probably wouldn’t work. Personal choices are important because they’re an extension of our awareness of the problem of what’s in our air, what’s in our water, what our energy mix means for life as we know it and what it will mean for generations to come. What everybody chooses to do with that is important, but what is hugely important is talking about it. Letting it inform your choices as a consumer and a voter for sure. But also realizing that the decision-makers who work in C-suites of the biggest petrochemical companies, the biggest fossil fuel legacy companies in the world – you could fit all of them in a couple of Greyhound buses. Right now, governments are subsidizing fossil fuel. They’re paying companies to uncork the Godzilla that is changing weather in horrible ways. So until massive systems change, the best you can do as a consumer is just be aware and talk about it. WOLF: That’s kind of depressing. What am I missing? WEIR: There’s a couple of things that I like to point out. In 2022, if you asked the average American to guess how many of their fellow countrymen and women both understand the climate crisis and are supportive of meaningful action, the average response was 33% to 40%, regardless of party. In reality, it is like 66% to 80%. The authors of the paper call it “pluralistic ignorance.” If you care about an Earth in balance, you think you’re outnumbered two to one, when the opposite is true. People are surrounded by allies they didn’t know they had. People also underestimate how quickly nature can heal itself if given a chance and how quickly systems can adjust when people work together. The pandemic taught us a lot of lessons, but it also produced a number of vaccines in record time when everyone was focused on one mission. So there’s a lot of room for despair. But there’s so many reasons for hope, and it’s just really about the stories we tell around this topic."

It’s messing with time itself,03-28-2024,"                                                 One day in the next couple of years, everyone in the world will lose a second of their time. Exactly when that will happen is being influenced by human activities.                                             ","Laura Paddison and Rachel Ramirez, CNN","One day in the next couple of years, everyone in the world will lose a second of their time. Exactly when that will happen is being influenced by humans, according to a new study, as melting polar ice alters the Earth’s rotation and changes time itself. The hours and minutes that dictate our days are determined by Earth’s rotation. But that rotation is not constant; it can change ever so slightly, depending on what’s happening on Earth’s surface and in its molten core. These nearly imperceptible changes occasionally mean the world’s clocks need to be adjusted by a “leap second,” which may sound tiny but can have a big impact on computing systems. Plenty of seconds have been added over the years. But after a long trend of slowing, the Earth’s rotation is now speeding up because of changes in its core. For the first time ever, a second will need to be taken off. “A negative leap second has never been added or tested, so the problems it could create are without precedent,” Patrizia Tavella, a member of the Time Department at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France, wrote in an article accompanying the study. But exactly when this will happen is being influenced by global warming, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. Melting polar ice is delaying the leap second by three years, pushing it from 2026 to 2029, the report found. “Part of figuring out what is going to happen in global timekeeping … is dependent on understanding what is happening with the global warming effect,” said Duncan Agnew, professor of geophysics at the University of California San Diego and the study’s author. Before 1955, a second was defined as a specific fraction of the time the Earth took to rotate once in relation to the stars. Then came the era of highly precise atomic clocks, which proved a much more stable way of defining a physical second. From the late 1960s, the world started using coordinated universal time (UTC) to set time zones. UTC relies on atomic clocks but still keeps pace with the planet’s rotation. But as the rotation speed is not constant, the two timescales slowly diverge. This means a “leap second” must be added every now and then to bring them back into alignment. Changes in Earth’s rotation over the long term have been dominated by the friction of the tides on the ocean floor — which has slowed down its rotation. Recently, the impacts of melting polar ice, driven by humans burning planet-heating fossil fuels, have become a significant factor, Agnew said. As the ice melts into the ocean, meltwater moves from the poles toward the equator, which further slows the speed of the Earth’s rotation. Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved in the study, describes the process like a figure skater spinning with their arms over their head. As they bring their arms down toward their shoulders, their spin slows. Polar ice melt “has been large enough to noticeably affect the rotation of the entire Earth in a way that is unprecedented,” Agnew said. “To me, the fact that human beings have caused the rotation of the Earth to change is kind of amazing.” But while melting ice may be slowing the Earth’s spin, there’s another factor at play when it comes to global timekeeping, according to the report: processes in the Earth’s core. The planet’s liquid core spins independently of its solid outer shell. If the core slows down, the solid shell speeds up to maintain momentum, Agnew said, and that is what’s currently happening. Very little is known about what’s going on roughly 1,800 miles below the Earth’s surface, and it’s not clear why the core’s speed is changing. “It’s fundamentally unpredictable,” said Agnew. But what is clear, according to the study, is that despite polar ice melt exerting a slowing influence, overall the Earth’s rotation is speeding up. That means the world will soon need to subtract a second for the first time. “A second doesn’t sound like much,” Agnew said, but computing systems set up for activities such as stock exchange transactions need to be accurate to a thousandth of a second. Many computer systems have software enabling them to add a second, but few have the capability to subtract one. Humans will need to reprogram computers, introducing the potential for error. “Nobody really anticipated that the Earth would speed up to the point where we might have to remove a leap second,” Agnew said. Scambos, the University of Colorado Boulder glaciologist, said the “big deal” of the study is that it shows “changes from the Earth’s core are now trending bigger than the trends in loss of ice from the poles — even though ice loss has picked up in the last decade.” “It’s a ‘yikes’ moment for some computer applications,” he told CNN, but for most people life will carry on as usual. For Agnew, the findings could be a powerful tool to connect people with the ways humans are changing the planet. “Being able to say so much ice has melted that it’s actually changed the rotation of the Earth by a measurable amount, I think gives you the sense, OK, this is a big deal.”"

A multi-day system will slide across much of the country and bring the potential for tornadoes, large hail, flooding and even snow. As if that weren’t enough, there could also be record warm temperatures. Widespread precipitation is expected as the very large system traverses from the Central US on Sunday to the Northeast by midweek. Snow and freezing rain will fall to the north, while heavy rain and severe thunderstorms unfold on the warmer side of the system. April is traditionally when severe thunderstorm activity begins to ramp up. More than half of the tornadoes in an average year occur from April through June, according to the Storm Prediction Center. The weather this April is following suit. On Monday, severe thunderstorms are possible from northern Texas to southern Ohio. The main threats are tornadoes, damaging winds and golf ball-sized hail or larger. The best chance for severe storms will occur in the afternoon and continue through the evening hours. Nighttime tornadoes are more deadly, so make sure you have a way to get warnings if you live in these areas. By Tuesday, the severe threat shifts east into an area from northern Mississippi to southern Pennsylvania. While tornadoes cannot be ruled out, the greatest threat here will be damaging winds. The threat for flooding will be highest from Missouri through Pennsylvania beginning on Monday. As the storm progresses east, these areas could see rainfall totals of up to 3 inches through midweek. One of the elements fueling the severe threat is the clash of cold air behind the system with the warm air out ahead. For some Southern cities, the warmth could break records. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, along with Corpus Christi and Del Rio, Texas, could see record high temperatures on Monday. Laredo, Texas, could also break a daily record high on Monday if the city reaches its forecast of 101 degrees – its normal high temperature for July 24. But while some parts of the South may feel more like summer, parts of the northern tier of the US will look and feel more like winter next week. Snow as well as freezing rain could be the big threats from the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes on Monday. Rapid City, South Dakota, is forecast to pick up 3 to 6 inches of snow Sunday and Monday with high temperatures only in the mid-30s – the normal high for early February. Minneapolis will see a mix of rain and snow, but even just an inch or two of snow will bring the city’s spring snowfall total to more than 16 inches – more snow than they picked up all winter. By Tuesday, the snow and ice shifts to interior areas of the Northeast and in the higher elevations of the Green, White and Adirondack Mountains. Snow may linger well into Thursday. These areas could end up seeing more snow than the Midwest simply because of the longer duration of the snow event. Snow amounts are subject to considerable change with the forecast still 3 to 5 days out, so keep checking back over the next few days for the latest thinking."

When it does rain, dried-out ground is unable to absorb the moisture, making flooding more likely. El Niño is exacerbating the impacts of the climate crisis, caused primarily by burning fossil fuels, which is driving more frequent and severe weather — including drought and floods — across southern Africa, a region Oxfam describes as a “climate disaster hotspot.” As southern Africa enters its traditional dry season this month, vast parts of the region — including Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe — have already been grappling with a prolonged dry spell. From late January to February, rainfall levels were the lowest in at least 40 years, a recent report from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs revealed. Central parts of the region experienced the driest February in more than 100 years, according to a report by the United States Agency for International Development’s Famine Early Warning Systems Network. In Zambia, Malawi and Central Mozambique, extreme drought has damaged more than  2 million hectares of crops, Oxfam said. Zambia declared its drought a disaster on February 29. Malawi’s president declared a state of disaster across the majority of the country on March 23. It’s the fourth consecutive year the country has been forced to do this due to the impact of extreme weather conditions. The World Food Programme said this week the El Niño impact is “exacerbating the devastating effects of the climate crisis in Malawi.” Southern Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change despite being responsible for only a tiny portion of global planet-heating pollution. In Mozambique — a country accounting for only 0.2% of global emissions — 3 million people face hunger, according to Oxfam. The country’s capital, Maputo, experienced devastating floods in March, after Tropical Storm Filipo hit followed a few weeks later by further intense rainfall. “It is so deeply unjust that climate change impacts are hammering Mozambique over and over again. One of the poorest countries in the world is carrying the costs of the climate crisis it has done little to cause and is being pushed deeper into debt and spiralling poverty,” Teresa Anderson, ActionAid’s International Climate Justice Lead, said last week following the flooding. “Wealthy polluting  countries need to own up to their responsibility for the damage they are  doing through climate change and be willing to provide climate finance  so that vulnerable communities can cope with the climate disasters that  are being unleashed,” she added. Oxfam’s southern Africa program director, Machinda Marongwe, said the region is “in crisis” and called on donors to “immediately release resources” to prevent the spiral into an “unimaginable humanitarian situation.” “With all these countries facing multiple crises simultaneously, the urgency cannot be overstated,” Marongwe said."

",Opinion by Tom Steyer,"Editor’s Note: Tom Steyer is the founder and co-executive chair of Galvanize Climate Solutions, an investment firm focused on the energy transition. His upcoming book, “Cheaper, Faster, Better: How We’ll Win the Climate War,” is available now for pre-order. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his own. View more opinion on CNN. Earlier this year, during the warmest February in recorded history, the investment giants JPMorgan Chase, State Street, BlackRock and Pimco walked away from some of their boldest climate pledges. The leaders of these firms, with a combined more than $15 trillion under management, did not deny that climate change exists, that humans are its cause or that its potential consequences are catastrophic. Instead, some pointed to their legal responsibility to shareholders, which they said precluded them from following through on climate pledges. Others argued that their own climate standards were sufficient, or reserved the right to make business-related decisions without having to take the climate pledge into account. Some might think that, questions of morality aside, fossil fuel investments are just too good to pass up. In the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the oil and gas industry has seen its profits soar. Even in the United States, where President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act is making historic investments in clean energy, oil exports are at an all-time high. But if there’s one lesson I’ve learned in decades as an investor, it’s that things change. On closer examination, the simplest argument against funding new oil, gas and coal projects is not that they’re immoral. It’s that they’re unsound. For investors — and their shareholders — funding new fossil fuel projects is a risky bet. First off, an oil and gas project begun today won’t come online for years, sometimes even decades. According to the Global Energy Monitor, the global average timeline from discovery to production is 11 years, with one study finding that in the world’s largest oil fields, it takes an average of 17 years to go from the first barrel to maximum production. This means that when institutional investors bankroll fossil fuels, they’re not just betting that demand for oil and gas will be sky high in the short term. They’re betting that demand will remain sky high 10, 20 or even 30 years from now. The future is famously difficult to predict, and there’s a chance that that prediction will turn out to be correct. But it’s hardly a sure thing. Renewables such as solar and wind are growing at an exponential rate. Global conflicts are pushing countries without fossil fuel resources to seek energy independence. A wave of new technology is bringing down the cost of clean energy while making its adoption easier than ever. There’s enormous potential for fossil fuel demand to fall more quickly, and more sharply, than today’s investors expect. Oil and gas has a supply problem, too. The fossil fuel companies’ business model is the same as it was in 1985, when I was a young analyst at Morgan Stanley examining oil industry price decks: sell each barrel of oil or ton of natural gas for more than it costs to produce. What has changed is that the low-hanging fruit is gone. In many places where oil is easy to extract, the oil has either already been extracted, or someone is already extracting it. New technologies such as fracking have expanded the amount of oil than can theoretically be obtained, but at a substantially higher cost than traditional drilling. Even in Texas, where potential drilling sites are ranked on a three-tier scale, companies have no choice but to drill new wells in the less desirable tier two and tier three locations; there’s very little tier one left. Drilling in remote locations, such as the Arctic or far offshore, is more expensive still. The oldest piece of investment advice in the book is “buy low, sell high.” But in many cases, today’s fossil fuel investors aren’t following it. They’re buying high and hoping to sell even higher. What should be even more concerning to investors is that fossil fuel companies’ challenges go beyond supply and demand. Oil and gas companies face vast litigation risk as well. Over the past several years, states and municipalities across the country have sued oil companies, arguing, persuasively, that the companies knowingly deceived the public about climate change and its effects. In many ways, the fossil fuel industry finds itself where big tobacco was in the 1990s. They haven’t yet been forced to pay damages, but if the floodgates open, the projected cost to oil and gas companies could amount to more than $200 billion per year. Finally, there is perhaps the greatest risk fossil fuel investors face: the industry’s massive profits are largely dependent on special treatment by governments. Last year alone, oil, coal and gas received an estimated $7 trillion in subsidies worldwide. In the United States, fossil fuel companies enjoy a wide range of industry-specific tax breaks, including one allowing many oil producers to deduct 15% of their total income from their taxes. Clean energy, meanwhile, is already winning in the marketplace. In less than 50 years, the average cost of solar panels has fallen by more than 99.7%, from nearly $126 per watt of energy generated to 26 cents; in many parts of the country and the world, renewables are already cheaper than some fossil fuels. But even this obscures the full extent of fossil fuels’ market weakness. If the playing field ever becomes level, oil and gas will struggle to compete. Twelve years ago, I stepped away from Farallon Capital, the investment fund I founded, to focus on climate full time. When investing in promising, innovative companies, I now see returns as a means to an end, and the end is impact. That’s one reason the last 12 years have been among the most rewarding, fulfilling and fun of my life. But today, you don’t have to be an advocate or activist to see the opportunities in the clean energy transformation, or the danger in betting big on fossil fuels. All you have to do is follow the advice of the conservative economist Herbert Stein, who offered what I still consider to be among the greatest pieces of investment wisdom: “If something cannot go on forever it will stop.” Today, an institutional investor that backs new fossil fuel projects is betting that our addiction to fossil fuels will go on forever. Even if all I cared about was financial responsibility to my shareholders, I wouldn’t make that bet."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/weather/hurricane-season-forecast-climate/index.html,Earliest look at hurricane season is calling for more storms than it’s ever predicted,04/04/2024,                                                 The first forecast for this year’s Atlantic hurricane season is in and it’s going to be one to watch.                                             ,"Ritu Prasad, CNN","The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season isn’t here yet, but is already shaping up to be one for the books, with more hurricanes and named storms predicted in a pre-season forecast from Colorado State University than ever before. This June through November could see 23 named storms in all, including 11 hurricanes and five Category 3 or higher “major” hurricanes, according to the university’s Atlantic hurricane season forecast, released Thursday. “This is the most active April forecast that we have ever issued,” lead forecaster Phil Klotzbach told CNN. “Our prior highest hurricane forecast in April was 9 hurricanes, which we have called for several times” since the forecasts began in 1995. With the caveat that early outlooks aren’t set in stone given the “considerable changes that can occur in the atmosphere-ocean between April and the peak” of the season, it’s still an ill omen for a particularly active storm season. And, researchers say they have “above-normal confidence” for this April’s predictions. “We anticipate a well above-average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean,” the group said in a news release. On average, the Atlantic season brings 14 named storms, with seven hurricanes, three of them major. Last hurricane season had 20 named storms including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes. The only other Colorado State outlooks to predict this many hurricanes were mid-season forecasts in August 2005 and 2020 – which ended up being the two most-active Atlantic seasons on record. “The highest number of hurricanes that we have predicted at any lead time is 12 … which we forecast in August of 2020,” Klotzbach said, adding that was still an undershot, with 14 hurricanes total that year. “We also forecast 11 hurricanes in August of 2005. That season ended up with 15 hurricanes.” The researchers will issue updates to the forecast on June 11, July 9 and August 6. With the forecast in, the next question is: Why? You may have heard talk of El Niño during last year’s hurricane season. Now, we’ll be dealing with the opposite natural climate phenomenon, La Niña, and its potential impacts will be key this season. El Niño is when the surface waters of the central and eastern Pacific are warmer than normal. El Niño heats up the atmosphere and changes circulation patterns around the globe; it also influences global weather, including cyclone seasons. When the Pacific is warmer, the region typically sees more tropical cyclones, but the Atlantic sees fewer, thanks to more upper-level winds that rip apart storms and prevent them from forming. As El Niño’s opposite, La Niña suppresses those upper-level winds, making conditions ideal for hurricane formation and intensification. There is a 55% chance for La Niña to develop from June to August and a 77% chance from September to November, according to a March forecast from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. The overarching impacts of climate change are also, as ever, at play. Planet-warming pollution is driving global and ocean temperature rise, and the world’s oceans have now experienced an entire year of unprecedented heat thanks to this human-caused warming and El Niño. And as the planet warms, the impacts of hurricanes are becoming more dangerous. Global sea levels are also on the rise, driven mainly by the rapid melting of ice sheets and glaciers. A rise of only a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference in how far inland a hurricane’s storm surge can travel. A warmer climate also means there will be more water vapor available in the atmosphere to potentially fall as rain. The water in the Atlantic, particularly where most hurricanes form, has been record-warm. A warm Atlantic in spring usually means warmer water during hurricane season because it creates conditions that stop water-cooling winds from forming, Colorado State University researchers said in Thursday’s news release. And more warm water means more chances for storms. “A very warm Atlantic favors an above-average season, since a hurricane’s fuel source is warm ocean water,” the release said. “In addition, a warm Atlantic leads to lower atmospheric pressure and a more unstable atmosphere. Both conditions favor hurricanes.” CNN’s Eric Zerkel contributed to this report."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/07/weather/weather-changes-total-solar-eclipse-climate/index.html,"While you watch the eclipse, you’ll also be able to feel it",04/08/2024,"                                                 On Monday, April 8, a total solar eclipse will alter weather conditions on the Earth’s surface as it plays out in the sky.                                             ","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","On Monday, April 8, a total solar eclipse will alter weather conditions on the Earth’s surface while the astronomical marvel unfolds in the sky. Changes to temperature, wind speed and humidity occur as the moon crosses in front of the sun and casts a shadow on Earth’s surface during a solar eclipse. The more sunlight blocked, the more dramatic the weather changes. The effect is comparable to how shaded areas end up much cooler on a hot day than any place in direct sunlight. April’s total solar eclipse will block the entire sun in a 115-mile wide path from Texas to Maine, known as the path of totality. Dallas, Indianapolis, Cleveland and Buffalo, New York, are just a few cities that will experience the phenomenon. The moon will block a significant portion of the sun and create a partial solar eclipse outside of the path of totality. The closer an area is to the path of totality, the larger the portion of the sun and its solar radiation – sunlight and energy – will be obscured by the moon. At least 50% of the sun will be blocked during the eclipse as far west as Anaheim, California, and as far east as Orlando, Florida. Only around 20% of the sun will be blocked in the Pacific Northwest. But a reduction in solar radiation, no matter how brief, can affect temperatures and other weather. Not all eclipse weather changes are created equal, though. The exact drop in temperature can vary widely based on other factors like cloud cover and the time of year. Time of year matters because the angle at which sunlight strikes the Earth affects temperatures, with a higher angle producing more intense sunshine and heat. The sun angle rises throughout the spring, reaches its peak in summer and starts to drop in the fall. The last total solar eclipse took place during a summer afternoon in late August, so temperatures were already high and more prone to crater in some locations along the path of totality. Temperatures fell 11 degrees over just one hour in Douglas, Wyoming, and widespread temperature drops of 4 to 8 degrees happened across the South. April’s eclipse will unfold with a lower sun angle than August, but as the warmest part of the afternoon approaches. So, the brief, eclipse-driven cooldown will be quite noticeable before temperatures rebound back to pre-eclipse levels. Temperatures during April’s event could drop around 10 degrees for up to an hour in the path of totality, said Andrew White, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Indianapolis. Temperature drops will be less pronounced in partial eclipse areas. The eclipse will also influence humidity levels, which limit how far temperatures can drop during totality. How humid it feels is tied closely to temperature. Humidity rises when the air temperature and the dew point, which measures how much moisture is in the air, approach the same temperature. So when air temperatures briefly dip during an eclipse, they trend closer to the dew point and make the air feel a bit more humid. But air temperatures cannot fall below the dew point, so if dew points start out high during the eclipse they’ll limit how low temperatures can go. Less solar radiation and reduced temperatures during an eclipse can also affect wind and cloud cover. The cooldown during an eclipse briefly reduces the amount of heat stored in the atmosphere. Heat forces air to rise and makes the atmosphere unstable. The atmosphere then creates clouds, storms and wind to let out heat energy in an attempt to bring itself back into balance. So as the eclipse cools the air, the atmosphere calms down and wind speeds drop because the atmosphere isn’t working as hard to balance itself out. Scientists took a number of weather measurements in Wyoming and New York during 2017’s total solar eclipse and found wind speeds dropped by an average of 6 mph as a result of the eclipse. A significant temperature drop can also alter cloud cover. Clouds over parts of South Carolina disappeared during 2017’s total solar eclipse because they lost their fuel – heat that forces air to rise and form clouds. It’s possible something similar happens during Monday’s eclipse. Monday’s eclipse is the only chance to see a total solar eclipse from the Lower 48 for the next two decades. The next total solar eclipse to cross the country won’t arrive until August 12, 2045, but one will briefly clip portions of Montana and the Dakotas on August 23, 2044."

","Heather Chen, CNN","The death of a toddler from extreme heat highlighted the risk of climate-related illnesses across Malaysia. The same week, Vietnam declared a state of emergency after abnormally high temperatures in the south dried up entire rice fields. And in the Philippines, hundreds of schools suspended classes after daily temperatures soared past 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). Sweltering heat is back in Southeast Asia, one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change. And it is not going away any time soon, scientists have warned. Home to more than 675 million people across 11 countries, the region has seen temperatures reach unprecedented levels – with little respite from merciless heat and humidity, climatologist Maximiliano Herrera told CNN. Thailand has been worst hit, Herrera said, adding that heat forecasts there have been especially dire. Temperatures across the country had been “breaking non-stop records” for 13 months – and heat and humidity levels were relentless, he said. “We thought temperatures last year were unbearable but (what we are seeing) this year has beaten that – temperatures in Bangkok won’t drop below 30 degrees Celsius, even at night for the rest of April,” Herrera told CNN. “The trend is inescapable. The region has to prepare for terrible heat for the rest of April and most of May.” On April 3, as Thailand entered its annual dry season, the capital Bangkok clocked temperatures of around 109 degrees Fahrenheit – prompting many to stay indoors in air-conditioned comfort. In nearby Vietnam, the heat wave brought intense droughts to the south – driving temperatures up to nearly 104 degrees Fahrenheit and wreaking havoc on the country’s vital agriculture industry. Vietnam is one of the world’s largest rice exporters and low rainfall spells trouble for farmers in its Mekong delta region. Rice fields and rivers have dried up, according to Vietnamese media reports, and farmers have been struggling without rainwater for their crops. Record heat waves in 2023 caused severe power outages in several cities. This year, Vietnamese meteorologists have attributed the unusually long dry spell to El Niño, a natural climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and influences weather all over the world. But alongside these natural variations, the world continues to blast through climate records, with deadly heat waves becoming the norm. Though average temperatures in Southeast Asia have risen every decade since 1960, experts say one of the most worrying characteristics of the heat wave now sweeping across the region is its prolonged duration - with no end in sight. Researchers from Swiss climate research group IQ Air attributed the current heat wave to “a combination of factors which include human-induced climate change and the El Niño event.” “This phenomenon has led to unprecedented high temperatures across the region,” IQ Air said in a statement on April 5. “There is currently no definitive end date projected as an abatement to the heat will depend on factors such as weather patterns and (government) mitigation efforts.” One mitigation effort being considered in Malaysia is cloud seeding, injecting particles into clouds – usually from an airplane – to make it rain. “Our air assets are always ready,” said Adly Zahari, the deputy defense minister. “Cloud seeding should take into account various weather factors such as cloud conditions and the wind before it is carried out.” At least two heat-related fatalities have been reported in the country – a 22-year-old man from the northern state of Pahang and a 3-year-old boy, in neighboring Kelantan. Both died of heatstroke, according to health officials. Officials in Sabah, a state on Borneo island, also reported close to 300 fires that started at farms, plantations and forests throughout February. Climate change has made “Malaysia vulnerable to extreme heat,” the country’s Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said on the sidelines of a talk in late March following heatstroke cases. “We are thankful that we have not yet reached the third level of extreme heat waves but this could happen at any time.” But there is still much to be done, say some living in the capital Kuala Lumpur. Like many Malaysians, university student Aidil Iman Aidid has been trying to adapt to the ongoing heat, especially in recent weeks when he fasted for Ramadan. “This year’s Ramadan has been the hottest and most challenging,” he told CNN, while staying hydrated was especially tricky, given that hot days “now feel much longer.” “We are living in extreme weather conditions,” said Aidil, adding that he often woke up thirsty and tired after taking naps during the fasting period. “There’s so much to be done and I really want to see governments across the region not just adapting (but also) establishing greater climate resilience against extreme hazards,” he said. In Singapore, some schools have told students to wear cooler, looser gym gear until further notice, given persistently high temperatures in recent weeks. “We are continuing to monitor the heat situation and well-being of students and staff closely – especially those who may be more vulnerable to the effects of higher temperature conditions,” an Education Ministry spokesperson told CNN. Similar actions were taken by hundreds of schools in the Philippines, including dozens in the capital Manila, that canceled classes after temperatures reached unbearable levels. But watchdog groups have expressed concerns about children’s safety. “Educators and local authorities have been forced to take the extreme decision to shut hundreds of schools because this extreme heat means children are simply unable to concentrate in the classroom and their health is also at risk,” said a statement by Save The Children Philippines. “We need to see urgent action now to limit warming to a maximum of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. “Failing to do this will have dramatic consequences for children’s health, safety and wellbeing.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/10/health/climate-change-stroke-deaths-wellness/index.html,"Extreme temperatures are tied to more than half a million stroke deaths a year.

","Jen Christensen, CNN","In 2019 alone, more than half a million people died due to a stroke linked to high and low temperatures, a new study found. With the world getting warmer due to human-made climate change, that number is expected to rise. The study, published Wednesday in the medical journal Neurology, found that since 1990, the number of strokes attributable to high and low temperatures have been increasing all around the globe. Men had more strokes related to extreme temperatures than women, but it affected people across all age groups. For this study, researchers looked at temperatures and strokes in 204 countries and territories. Researchers from Xiangya Hospital Central South University in China created a model using global data on disease, deaths and disability and climate data that captures temperatures, cloud cover and weather variables. The study authors noted that the number of people having strokes has risen as the population ages and grows, but this doesn’t account for everything. “Nonoptimal temperatures” made a difference: The number of people who had a stroke due to hot and cold temperatures grew and was significantly larger in 2019 than in 1990. In 2019, it was low temperatures that led to the higher number of strokes. While that may sound counterintuitive for global warming, cold temperatures also come along with climate change. Warmer temperatures on land interfere with the polar vortex — the dense cold air mass around the poles — and when it is weakened, it can lead to cooler temperatures. Right now, stroke deaths connected to extreme temperatures are disproportionately concentrated in parts of the world with with a higher levels of people living in poverty and where health care systems are fragile, like in Africa. The study said the rapid increase in stroke burden due to high temperature in Central Asia “also requires special attention.” As the planet gets warmer, the study said, the burden of strokes due to high temperature “has increased rapidly” and that number will grow “sharply” in the future. Higher temperatures are already here. Last year was the warmest since scientists started recording global temperatures in 1850 and temperatures are expected to break more records in the near future. This March was the hottest one on record. Dr. Mary Rice, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who did not work on the new study, said its findings are significant. “I really think that group did a very nice job of taking a global approach looking at historic data and to draw attention to a health issue that I think it’s not really getting a lot of attention,” said Rice, a pulmonologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “The total burden of people who died from strokes from temperature is actually a very large number.” Rice recently published a study in Frontiers in Science that found climate change is also driving an increasing number of immune-mediated diseases such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases and cancers. Rice’s study suggests that multilevel mitigation actions are urgently needed to reduce emissions and to improve air quality while addressing the climate crisis. Without immediate global action, the world is going to see a much greater burden of disease, she said. Stroke is already a significant health problem. It is the third leading cause of disability worldwide, and one of the leading causes of death, earlier studies showed. The new study wasn’t designed to show why extreme temperatures that come with the climate crisis seem to be causing so many strokes. Other research has shown that when temperatures are excessively hot, it’s difficult for the body to regulate and cool itself by sweating. This can lead to what doctors call a hypercoagulable state of the blood, when the blood clots easier and increases the risk of stroke. People may also become dehydrated, which can force the heart to work too hard, also increasing a person’s chance of having a stroke or heart attack. Extreme cold temperatures also can lead someone to have a stroke. When the body is exposed to cold, it stimulates the skin’s cold receptors which triggers what’s known as the sympathetic nervous system, the network of nerves that control the body’s fight or flight response. That can cause vasoconstriction, the constriction of blood vessels in the skin, arms, and legs, leading  blood pressure to spike and potentially leading to a stroke. Dr. Ali Saad, a neurologist who’s affiliated with the Climate and Health Program at the University of Colorado, said when he is already talking about this phenomenon with stroke patients and reminding them how dangerous extreme temperatures, particularly heat, can be. He said he will take their phone and add weather alerts so they are mindful of when temperatures will spike. “I tell them ‘I’m worried that you’re going to overheat and there are things we can do to prevent both stroke and worsening climate change,’ ” Saad said. Saad did not work on the new study, but said he hopes this latest research will grab the attention of global leaders and influence public policy. “The fact that extreme weather, or extreme temperatures more specifically, is a risk factor for stroke is known, but what this study adds is that it’s the first to examine things on a global scale,” Saad said. “People, when they think of pollution or heat when it’s related to health outcomes, stroke or otherwise, tend to think of low- to middle-income countries, but it’s happening across the board and it’s expected to get worse.”"

","Katie Hunt, CNN","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. The icy plains of Antarctica are a magnet for meteorite hunters such as Maria Valdes, a research scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History and the University of Chicago. Some 1,000 space rocks are found in the region each year. Their dark hue is easy to spot in the white expanse. “Antarctica, a desert of ice, provides an ideal background for meteorite recovery — go to the right place, and any rock you find must have fallen from the sky,” said Valdes, who visited the region as part of an expedition team in late 2022 and early 2023 for her work at the museum’s Robert A. Pritzker Center for Meteoritics and Polar Studies. The international team found five meteorites. “We stumbled across an enormous brown stone sitting by itself in the middle of an ice field. It was a little bit smaller than a bowling ball and quite heavy — 7.6 kg (about 17 pounds),” she said via email. “I had seen and handled so many meteorites in my career, but finding one yourself is such a different feeling.” Formed from extraterrestrial bodies such as the moon, Mars or large asteroids, each meteorite tells a unique tale about the solar system and how it was formed. But the climate crisis threatens this trove of scientific information, according to a new study. Meteorites are disappearing into the ice, putting them out of the reach of scientists. “As the climate continues to warm, Antarctic rocks are sinking into the ice at an increasing rate. Over time, this will make many meteorites inaccessible to scientists,” said Valdes, who wasn’t involved in the latest research. “We lose precious time capsules that hold clues to the history of our Solar System.” As Earth warms, about 5,000 meteorites could disappear from the surface of melting ice sheets every year, according to the study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. To date, more than 48,000 meteorites have been discovered in Antarctica, accounting for about 60% of specimens found globally. Meteorites, lumps of rock that fall from space through Earth’s atmosphere randomly, do not fall in an evenly scattered pattern across the frozen continent. Concentrations emerge in certain locations because of geography and weather patterns, Valdes explained. Meteorites are particularly plentiful in blue ice fields. In these areas, a combination of ice flow processes and local weather conditions remove layers of snow and ice from the surface, exposing meteorites that were once embedded in the ice. The windblown ice tends to look blue compared with the surrounding surface snow. “Over significant stretches of time (tens or hundreds of thousands of years) phenomenal concentrations of meteorites can develop, as high as 1 per square meter in some locations,” she said. Researchers have identified areas of meteorite-rich blue ice mostly by luck. However, to systematize the search, Veronica Tollenaar, a doctoral researcher at Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, and her colleagues used a machine-learning algorithm to create a “treasure map” of probable meteorite-rich zones, based on factors including surface temperature, surface slope, surface cover and ice flow movement. That research, published in January 2022 in the journal Science Advances, identified 600 zones and suggested that 300,000 meteorites are still present at the surface of the ice sheet. Valdes said in 2023 she and her colleagues used the information to help inform their decision on exactly where to search during their expedition. “Our experience … indicates that so far, Tollenaar’s approach only works to a first order. Local parameters such as topography and wind directions that can redistribute meteorites from blue ice fields into local meteorite traps have to be considered as well,” Valdes said. In the new study, co-lead author Tollenaar and her team projected the loss of meteorites under different climate change scenarios by combining climate modeling with their work from the 2022 paper. The meteorites can sink into the ice even if temperatures are below zero degrees Celsius (32 Fahrenheit). The sun heats up the dark rock, which absorbs solar radiation more easily because of its color, which melts the surrounding ice. “With that heat, it can locally melt the ice and slowly disappear from the surface,” Tollenaar said. Harry Zekollari, who was co-lead author along with Tollenaar on the new study, said that cold surface temperature was one of four factors linked to a potential meteorite cluster. “It’s really important that it’s cold and if your surface temperature starts changing, even if it’s going from minus 12 C to minus 9 C, it’s crossing a magic threshold where you’re starting to lose meteorites,” said Zekollari, an associate professor of glaciology at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Under current policies, which the study said may result in a warming of 2.6 degrees Celsius to 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.7 F to 4.9 F) above preindustrial levels, the researchers estimated that 28% to 30% of the meteorites in Antarctica could become inaccessible. Under a high-emission scenario, the estimate increased to 76%. Only at elevations above 2,500 meters (8,202 feet) will meteorites losses be less than 50%, the study said. Matthias van Ginneken, a research associate at the University of Kent’s Centre for Astrophysics and Planetary Science in the UK, said the work “made a lot of sense considering how global warming seems to affect Antarctica.” However, van Ginneken, who wasn’t involved in the study, said he wished the authors had talked more about uncertainties in their model and conducted lab experiments to simulate how global warming affects meteorites, which would support the results of the algorithm. “It is certainly worrying, but there will still be thousands of meteorites to find per year,” he said via email. “The main worry is the logistical aspect of searching for Antarctica meteorites, which is already difficult today due to the remoteness of Antarctica. Should the results of this study prove to be true, it will force scientists to explore new areas, potentially even further away from scientific bases than those that are commonly explored. It would make this treasure trove even more inaccessible and, thus, necessitate more funding and logistical support.” Meteorites discovered in the southernmost reaches of the planet have taught us a lot, said Kevin Righter, a planetary scientist at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston in a commentary published alongside the research. He was not involved in the new study. Scientists recognized meteorites collected in the region in 1979 and 1981 as originating from the moon, Righter noted. Before these finds, the only samples from the moon were from the Apollo and Luna landing sites. The meteorite samples have resulted in a more random and comprehensive sampling of the entire lunar surface. Other meteorites have been connected to Mars. “All of this recent research history indicates that with continued collection, new meteorite types are likely to be found — including perhaps pieces of Mercury or Venus that might have been ejected from their surface following impacts.” Righter, along with the study authors, called for collection efforts to be ramped up and prioritized. “If meteorites are not collected quickly enough, they will be a lost resource for present and future planetary science,” he added."

And the same planet-warming pollution that’s driving the climate crisis is likely to blame for these “killer events” on the other end of the temperature spectrum. The world’s oceans have been plagued by unprecedented heat over the past year, fueling concerns for marine life. Billions of crabs disappeared in the northern Pacific; sea lions and dolphins are washing up sick; iconic coral reefs are undergoing mass bleaching. But even as ocean temperatures climb, extremely cold upwelling events — when strong winds and ocean currents bring pockets of cold water up to the surface, replacing the warm water that was there — are also becoming more frequent and intense, threatening sea life, according to the study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. “Climate change is actually really complex,” said Nicolas Lubitz, lead author of the study and a researcher at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia. “It’s not just warming of the globe, but it’s really changing the way our oceans function.” When Lubitz heard reports of marine animals like sharks, manta rays and squids washing up dead in the southeast coast of South Africa in March 2021, he started investigating. More than 260 marine animals from 81 different species died in that one extreme event. He said seasonal upwelling events are common in that area, with water temperature dropping quickly. But Lubitz said the March 2021 die-off was “quite an extreme event, because we had rather warm water before it happened.” “And then the winds changed, and the currents started changing slightly, which is a seasonal thing,” he added. “Then all of a sudden, the temperature within 24 hours dropped by 11 degrees.” The researchers analyzed killer upwelling events in the Indian Ocean’s Agulhas Current and the East Australian Current, using 41 years of sea surface temperature data and 33 years of wind records to see how deadly cold ocean extremes can be. “We’re seeing changes in how often the upwelling occurs, how intense it is, which might impact the fishing communities in these areas,” he said. “It’s really an economic thing as well as the biodiversity thing.” According to the study, the lethality of a cold event is likely linked to how fast the temperature drops. If the cold event lasts for multiple days, which has been occurring more frequently, research shows that marine animals including turtles and many fish species could suffer from hypothermia and physiological malfunction or ultimately die. For a different study, Lubitz already had bull sharks electronically tagged with a transmitting locator device, which also recorded the depth and temperature of the part of the ocean they swim to. “That was really the key in this study in that we could see when the sharks migrate,” he said. “We could see how the temperature profiles change, and how the sharks were swimming shallower when they were in upwelling areas because they were trying to avoid the colder water from the depths.” The findings provide a “very reasonable explanation” to the many unexpected marine mortality events people have been seeing around the world, said Ajit Subramaniam, research professor with Columbia University’s Climate School’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “It’s one of those unexpected findings and it’s not something we talk about a lot,” Subramaniam, who was not involved with the study, told CNN. “And therefore, this is a timely thing to remind us that the climate crisis works in both ways.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/climate/global-coral-reef-mass-bleaching-climate-hnk-intl/index.html,"Ocean heat is driving a global coral bleaching event, and it could be the worst on record",04-15-2024,                                                 At least 54 countries are experiencing mass coral bleaching as the climate crisis drives ocean temperatures to record-breaking levels                                             ,"Rebecca Wright, CNN","Coral reefs around the world are experiencing a mass bleaching event as the climate crisis drives record-breaking ocean heat, two scientific bodies announced Monday — with some experts warning this could become the worst bleaching period in recorded history. More than 54% of the world’s coral reef areas have experienced bleaching in the past year, affecting at least 53 countries and territories including large swaths of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, a joint statement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and The International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) said. “It is likely that this event will surpass the previous peak of 56.1% soon,” Derek Manzello, the coordinator for NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch program, said in an email to CNN. “The percentage of reef areas experiencing bleaching-level heat stress has been increasing by roughly 1% per week.” When corals are exposed to stress from marine heatwaves, they spit out the algae living within their tissue, which provides them with both their color and most of their energy. If ocean temperatures don’t return to normal, bleaching can lead to mass coral death, threatening the species and food chains that rely on them with collapse. This marks the world’s fourth global bleaching event, and the second in the past decade – with previous periods in 1998, 2010, and between 2014-2017. In the past year, mass bleaching has been confirmed in regions including Florida and the wider Caribbean, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, the South Pacific, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean including the east coast of Africa and the Seychelles. Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a climate scientist specializing in coral reefs based at the University of Queensland in Australia, predicted this mass bleaching event months ago. “We knew sea temperatures were increasing rapidly, but not at this speed,” Hoegh-Guldberg told CNN on Monday. “The worrying issue is that we don’t know how long this massive temperature change is likely to last.” The last 12 months have been the planet’s warmest on record and ocean temperatures have been surging off the charts. Global sea surface temperatures hit record highs in February and again in March, according to data from the European Commission’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. In February, scientists at the Coral Reef Watch program at NOAA added three new alert levels to the coral bleaching alert maps, to enable scientists to assess the new scale of underwater warming. El Niño, a natural climate pattern which originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and tends to push up global temperatures, has helped drive the unprecedented ocean heat. NOAA predicts La Niña, El Niño’s cooler counterpart, could arrive between June and August this year, which provides “a nugget of hope” for coral reefs, NOAA’s Manzello said. But, he added, bleaching events have still occurred during La Niña in the past few years. “I am becoming increasingly concerned about the 2024 summer for the wider Caribbean and Florida,” Manzello said. “When we roll into summer and the bleaching season for Florida and the Caribbean, it won’t take much additional seasonal warming to push temperatures past the bleaching threshold.” In mid-February, CNN witnessed extensive coral bleaching on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef – the world’s largest coral reef system – on five different reefs spanning the northern and southern areas. A mass bleaching event was officially confirmed there last month after aerial and underwater surveys by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. “The increasing frequency and extremity of marine heatwaves driven by climate change, is testing the tolerance levels of coral reefs,” said Selina Stead, the CEO of AIMS. “Climate change is the biggest threat to coral reefs worldwide and this global confirmation illustrates just how extensive its impact has been across the last 12 months.” “That is why it is critical the world works to reduce carbon emissions,” Stead added. “It is also important to ensure coral reefs are well managed at local and regional levels.” The UN Environment Programme has warned that if the world fails to aggressively lower its emissions, the planet is heading towards nearly 3 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels this century. Scientists predict that even at 2 degrees of warming — which the world could reach around 2050 — approximately 99% of corals on Earth would die. As well as being an essential habitat for marine life, coral reefs are crucial for the world’s coastal communities — they act as a vital defense system against the threat of flooding from storms and sea level rise, and also provide livelihoods and a vital food source for an estimated billion people globally. David Ritter, CEO of Greenpeace Australia, said reefs were facing “existential danger” and that blame lies “squarely with the main culprits fueling global warming: fossil fuel companies, and the governments who prop up this industry.” “We are running out of runway to avoid irreversible climate disaster,” he added, “and must act quickly to ensure an immediate end to new fossil fuels.”"

","David Allan, CNN","Record-breaking heat, rising sea levels, increasingly extreme weather and more are fueled by the human-made climate crisis. It doesn’t feel like a great time to be raising children, or having them in the first place. But maybe it still is, if we can counter fear with knowledge and hope. I chatted with Bill Weir, CNN’s Chief Climate Correspondent and host of the CNN Original Series “The Wonder List with Bill Weir,” about these topics, and about his new book, “Life As We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate, and Hope in a Changing World,” written as an open letter to his own kids. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. David Allan: Are you fundamentally an optimistic or pessimistic person by nature? Bill Weir: It depends on the day. I find that covering this beat, my mood is directly proportional to what I’m focused on. Some days it is a firehose of peer-reviewed dread and just more signs of how many ways humanity is wrecking the planet. But the days when I focus on the problem solvers, the dreamers, the doers, the folks who know that there’s a better future, (those days) heal the soul. When I actually sat down to write this book, we were in a very dark place nationally. And I found enough positive stories, I saw enough momentum going the right way, that most days I wake up now with more wonder than worry. The fight has just begun, and so much can be saved. And so much is worth saving. That’s the ethic I’m trying to pass down to my kids: to be clear-eyed about the challenges, but full of courage and hope for the solutions. Allan: On one hand, you wrote “The United States of America I knew and loved is gone … eaten from the inside by metastasized lies fed to furious people in forgotten places.” On the other hand, you intentionally had a child in the last few years. What would you say to someone who feels conflicted about having a baby right now? Weir: I would say we need all the good help we can get. And if you believe that your child is going to be a net positive for humanity, go for it. I think our basic purpose in life is to procreate. Nature wants replication and hopefully improvement for the next generation. It’s a very first-world problem to think about whether or not you have children. It’s tough for people, and I totally understand the psychology around this sort of thing, because we haven’t really come to grips with the mental stress of climate change. We haven’t processed through the ﻿five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) as they pertain to the climate to realize what we’ve lost. And we have to reach acceptance to what we need to build in order to survive and thrive. There are family counselors who deal with parents who are in the grips of this grief. They still want to expand their family (but) are so worried about what the future might bring. I think that’s a valid concern, and there was a time when I completely understood where those folks were coming from. But I’m so glad my little boy is here. He gives me inspiration that I otherwise might not have. He gives me perspective. I think that I’m a believer that humans can be a net positive for the planet. And most people want to be, and it really comes down to the stories we tell ourselves. Allan: Young people are worried about the climate. Some 84% of 10,000 people ages 16 to 25 years old across 10 countries were either moderately or extremely worried about climate change, according to a 2021 survey published in the Lancet Planet Health. More than 50% in the study said they felt sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless and guilty about it. And more than 45% said their feelings on the topic negatively affect their daily life and functioning. You cite a similar study in your book. What would you say to these teens and young adults? Or what do you say, because your daughter is in that age range, right? Weir: She’s 20. Well, I say “sorry” to begin with. We’re sorry our intended and unintended consequences have scrambled their futures. They can’t take for granted the things that I took for granted – air, water, temperature, how you build shelter, how you grow food – they don’t have the luxury of ignoring those things. My dad used to say to me, anytime I had problems, “Good thing you’re tough.” And so I feel like we have to raise a generation of resilient children and model for them what that looks like. We have to be constantly vigilant about unexpected, unnatural disasters. And we have to talk to each other in communities about these sorts of things. I think a big reason for these spikes in climate anxiety in these polls are the result of us not talking about it. The result of adults not having honest conversations about what we’re losing, what’s worth saving, the decisions we have to make, because there are no easy decisions anymore. We have to do brutal math on what is worth saving and what is worth letting go. I think it’s only through these conversations we get through the five stages of climate grief and reach the end of that, which is acceptance. Allan: I love this detail about the birth of your son, River, that he was conceived in a lighthouse during the pandemic. It’s the perfect metaphor, a beacon of light, of hope in the darkness. To carry that metaphor just a bit further, another feature of lighthouses is that they are built to withstand the worst of nature, and are often isolated to the point that they need to be self-sufficient. Are self-sufficiency and fortitude virtues you think parents need to put greater emphasis on now? Weir: Yes, absolutely. My dad was a bit of a misanthrope who loved to be alone. And he raised me with that sense of John Muir romanticism about living in a cabin in the woods. But John Muir was using an ax that was made in a factory somewhere, by other people who didn’t have the luxury of going off the grid. We need everybody. We need all hands on deck together these days. In terms of teaching resilience and independence, as a personality trait, I think that is vital. But I want my kids to be plugged into their communities, to be civically engaged, too. To know their power as citizens and conscious consumers. To be the kind of neighbor who makes everyone around them stronger, come what may. Allan: I have two children myself, ages 12 and 16. And when I talk to them about the climate crisis, I find myself trying to spin it a bit, to counteract the doom with optimism of reversing the course that we’re on, of government action, scientific breakthroughs, stories of people making change. How do we find that balance in daily conversation with our kids of being honest, but not hopeless? Weir: I’m trying to strike that balance all the time. The best advice I ever got for leading a climate beat in this part of my life came from Mr. Rogers, who famously said anytime he saw a scary event on television his mother told him to “look for the helpers;” there are always helpers rushing into the scene. And this book is dedicated to the helpers, not just the first responders that I meet in these disaster zones, but the countless folks living lives of quiet service and moving us in a more positive direction. The helpers lift me up – the idea that the same frontal lobes that built the problem as we exploded as a species, can solve them once we come together. There’s so much that can be done. There’s so much that can be saved."

","Samantha Delouya, CNN","Record-breaking heat waves, severe floods and acute wildfires, exacerbated by climate change, carry a colossal price tag: an approximately 19% reduction in global income over just the next 26 years, a new study published Wednesday found. That financial gut punch won’t just affect big governments and corporations. According to the United Nations, the world is heading toward a gain of nearly 3 degrees of global warming in the next century, even with current climate policies and goals – and researchers say individuals could bear the economic burden. The researchers in Wednesday’s study, published in Nature, said financial pain in the short-term is inevitable, even if governments ramp up their efforts to tackle the crisis now. “These impacts are unavoidable in the sense that they are indistinguishable across different future emission scenarios until 2049,” two of the study’s researchers from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, Maximilian Kotz and Leonie Wenz, told CNN via email. However, they say immediate actions to reduce climate change could stem some losses in the longer term. Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor and environmental researcher at Stanford University, said the economic damage from climate change will take different shapes. Not only can extreme weather events result in costly repairs to damaged property, but elevated temperatures can also impact agriculture, labor productivity, and even cognitive ability in some cases. While discourse about the cost of climate change often refers to potentially expensive mitigation efforts like curbing oil and gas use or technology to pull carbon pollution out of the air, investing in greener technology, the study argued that short-term financial damage wrought by climate change already outweighs the cost of trying to solve the crisis. Researchers estimated it would cost the global economy $6 trillion by 2050 to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement—the international agreement among nearly 200 nations to tackle climate change—compared to the study’s estimated $38 trillion economic damage due to climate change. “Adaptation could offer ways to reduce these damages,” the researchers Kotz and Wenz said. Bernardo Bastien, a researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, said that adaptation strategies, which are approaches designed not to reduce climate change, but to respond by limiting its negative effects, could help save money on a longer time horizon. Bastien gave an example: utility companies in the state of California that have shut down the electrical grid to prevent wildfires. “When you turn off electrical grids, you’re turning off industry and you’re turning off a lot of households that use electricity for their well-being,” Bastien said. “It’s very costly but very necessary.” And while the study concludes some economic damage is guaranteed before 2049, its authors argue that benefits from curbing climate change could emerge a few decades down the line. “Damage estimates diverge strongly across emission scenarios after 2049, conveying the clear benefits from mitigation from a purely economic point of view,” the study said. However, the expected financial hit won’t be distributed evenly. Diffenbaugh, who was not associated with the study, said that while research showing the aggregate impact of climate change is important, “embedded in those aggregate impacts are very stark disparities in who is most impacted by climate change.” “We have clear evidence that overall, the poor are harmed more,” he said. “That’s what’s likely to happen from the global warming that’s already occurred and what’s likely to happen even for small increments of global warming.” The Nature study estimated the economic damage of different regions. North America and Europe are expected to see a lower income reduction in the next 26 years at 11%, compared to South Asia and Africa at 22%. The United States, a historically large polluter, will take a smaller economic hit than some neighboring countries, according to the study. However, it won’t be spared from disruptions caused by a warming planet — especially younger generations of Americans. A different paper, published Tuesday in Consumer Reports from global consulting firm ICF, estimates that the lifetime personal cost of climate change for a baby born in the US in 2024 could be as high as $500,000. The ICF paper said price hikes on essential elements of the cost of living in the US will add up due to climate change. Housing costs are projected to increase by $125,000 over the lifetime of a person born in 2024, owing to elevated maintenance and insurance costs due to the risks of flooding and other weather-related damage, the paper said. Food prices are also seen rising by an estimated $33,000 over the lifetime of a 2024 baby, due to disruptions to agriculture and supply chains, the paper said. Other expenses, like energy, transportation and health care, are expected to balloon in the next few decades, as well. “For many Americans, this financial loss will require difficult decisions about how to pay for food, housing, and other daily expenses, which climate change will increase by approximately 9 percent over their lifetime,” the paper said."

","Nadeen Ebrahim, Mary Gilbert and Brandon Miller, CNN","Chaos ensued in the United Arab Emirates after the country witnessed the heaviest rainfall in 75 years, with some areas recording more than 250 mm (around 10 inches) of precipitation in fewer than 24 hours, the state’s media office said in a statement Wednesday. The rainfall, which flooded streets, uprooted palm trees and shattered building facades, has never been seen in the Middle Eastern nation since records began in 1949. In the popular tourist destination Dubai, flights were canceled, traffic came to a halt and schools closed. One-hundred millimeters (nearly 4 inches) of rain fell over the course of just 12 hours on Tuesday, according to weather observations at the airport – around what Dubai usually records in an entire year, according to United Nations data. The rain fell so heavily and so quickly that some motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles as the floodwater rose and roads turned into rivers. Extreme rainfall events like this are becoming more common as the atmosphere warms due to human-driven climate change. A warmer atmosphere is able to soak up more moisture like a towel and then ring it out in the form of flooding rainfall. The weather conditions were associated with a larger storm system traversing the Arabian Peninsula and moving across the Gulf of Oman. This same system is also bringing unusually wet weather to nearby Oman and southeastern Iran. In Oman, at least 18 were killed in flash floods triggered by heavy rain, the country’s National Committee for Emergency Management said. Casualties included schoolchildren, according to Oman’s state news agency. A 70-year-old man died after flooding swept away his vehicle in the UAE’s Ras Al-Khaimah, a police statement said on Tuesday. The rainfall continued to shift east Wednesday, impacting parts of southern Iran and Pakistan, areas that see little rainfall this time of year. Iran’s southernmost city of Chabahar, in the Sistan and Baluchestan province, recorded 130 mm of rain. People attempting to travel by road into the center of Dubai on Wednesday were trapped on the city’s highway. “The scary part is that there was nowhere you can go,” said Sofie, a Dubai resident who declined to provide a last name. Sofie ended up stranded outside her home for nearly 12 hours, some of which were spent sleeping in her car as surrounding roads remained submerged. Some taxi drivers refused to take the commuters any further due to the blocked roads, rendering them stuck on the main artery in Dubai. Commuters were seen walking across the road through giant puddles, trying to find alternative methods of transportation. Some of those stuck had travelled from abroad to Dubai to attend the World Blockchain Summit, a crypto conference scheduled for early next week. Shocking video showed the tarmac of Dubai International Airport – recently crowned the second-busiest airport in the world – underwater as massive aircraft attempt to navigate floodwaters. Large jets looked more like boats moving through the flooded airport as water sprayed in their wake and waves rippled through the deep water. Disruption to airport operations continued into Wednesday, after the storm had cleared, with access roads blocked by flooding and multiple airlines including flag carrier Emirates reporting flight delays. Budget airline Flydubai canceled all flights until 10 a.m. local time Wednesday. On Wednesday morning, Dubai International advised people to “NOT to come to the airport, unless absolutely necessary,” saying flights continue to be delayed and diverted. Emirates suspended check-in for passengers departing Dubai from 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday until midnight on Thursday due to “operational challengers caused by bad weather and road conditions.” Some 134 million passengers flew through the UAE’s airports last year, including 87 million traveling through Dubai International Airport alone. The UAE is home to approximately 10 million people. The UAE is a hub for five airlines. Video shared on social media showed furniture flying off balconies. In the Dubai Marina, a manmade canal lined with skyscrapers and retail outlets, furniture from nearby restaurants could be seen washed away by strong currents. Images published in local media showed traffic gridlocked on Dubai’s Sheikh Zayed Road, a 16-lane thoroughfare. Luxury cars were seen almost entirely submerged in the Business Bay district that is home to apartment buildings, offices and retail outlets. A Dubai Metro station was flooded with commuters having to wade through ankle-deep water. Delivery services stopped functioning and many Dubai residents were unable to leave their homes due to waterlogged streets, which cars and pedestrians couldn’t access. Some residents were seen rowing canoes outside their homes, and one viral video on social media showed residents wake boarding on a flooded street in a residential area. Other videos from social media showed water rushing through a major shopping mall and inundating the ground floor of homes. Madiha Khawaja, a tourist visiting from London with her husband and two children, aged two and four, said she felt “helpless” trying to calm her children amid the chaos. The rain had disrupted building lifts, including in some of Dubai’s tallest skyscrapers. Khawaja said she spent 45 minutes taking the stairs to her 27th floor apartment in the heart of Dubai to find rest and shelter for her toddlers. The journey was “grueling,” she said, adding that “upon reaching our apartment with hungry and tired kids, we were met with dry taps, no drinking water, no telephone service, no WiFi connection.” “The kids were hungry, and I as a mother was getting very anxious and upset,” she told CNN. An official at the UAE’s National Center of Meteorology was cited by local newspaper The National as saying that the rain was not caused by cloud seeding, putting to rest rumors that the chaos was man-made. CNN has reached out to the center for comment. The practice is meant to enhance rainfall in arid or semi-arid regions and entails the “seeding” of existing clouds with substances that eventually help the clouds induce rain. The UAE has been cloud-seeding since the 1990s and has been doing it regularly over the past few years. Like the rest of the Persian Gulf region, Dubai has a hot and dry climate. As such, rainfall is infrequent, and the city’s infrastructure often fails to handle extreme weather events. CNN’s Abbas Al Lawati, Teele Rebane, Kathleen Magramo, Mostafa Salem, Sophie Tanno and team Eleni Giokos contributed reporting."

The administration may also allow a slower phase-in for a portion of the rules, which are due to be finalized as soon as next week. The potential change of plans comes as the administration faces fierce political headwinds, a conservative Supreme Court majority that has shown aggressive interest in curtailing the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority and questions over how fast electric utilities can pivot to the most innovative climate solutions. The EPA is considering eliminating a proposal for new natural gas plants to use hydrogen alongside natural gas to make electricity, the sources said. The expected changes mean both existing coal and new gas plants would primarily rely on carbon capture and storage to cut their climate pollution, rather than hydrogen fuels. Hydrogen, while in its infancy, is seen by scientists as the future of clean, climate-friendly fuel. But not all environmental groups are opposed to shelving the idea, given the concerns that the current forms hydrogen are not yet 100% pollution-free, and worries that it could expose the rule to legal challenges. The power plant rules are still under review and no final decisions on them have been made. EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll declined to comment, saying, “The draft final rule is currently with the Office of Management and Budget under interagency review.” A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The EPA power plant rules are one of the most important and highly anticipated planks of President Joe Biden’s climate agenda. The potential change comes amid questions on how quickly the industry could scale up clean hydrogen, a relatively nascent technology derived both from fossil fuels such as natural gas, as well as cleaner hydrogen – which uses clean electricity to split water. A handful of projects have demonstrated the ability to burn hydrogen in a gas turbine, “but it’s not a widespread technology yet,” Mike O’Boyle, the senior director of electricity at nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, told CNN. Utilities have proposed building more natural gas plants to keep electricity flowing onto a grid with increased demands from the growing number of electric vehicles and AI and data centers. Clean energy and climate groups have argued in favor of cleaner and cheaper sources of energy such as wind, solar and battery storage. The possible move away from hydrogen could make it easier for the EPA to defend against potential court challenges to the plan. The conservative Supreme Court and its 2022 ruling on West Virginia v. EPA has loomed large over how the agency has crafted its rules. The Supreme Court ruling significantly curtailed the EPA’s ability to regulate carbon pollution at power plants by having utilities outfit their power plants with carbon capture, rather than requiring a shift from coal or natural gas-fired power to cheaper and cleaner sources like wind and solar. One of the thorny issues facing the EPA was how using hydrogen at natural gas plants would fall in the Supreme Court’s narrow definition. And some environmental groups were concerned it would be tough for the federal government to ensure the hydrogen was clean, not more polluting. The EPA is also considering pushing back its initial timeline requiring existing coal-fired power plants to cut or capture 90% of their planet-warming pollution using carbon capture and storage by two years to 2032, the sources said. The EPA announced in February it would delay the rule-making process for carbon emissions from existing gas plants, which had initially been covered under the agency’s proposal last year. O’Boyle said that, judging from the comments and wide disagreement from industry and environmental groups, it is very likely that EPA will face a lawsuit. “One thing we can all count on is that the EPA will be sued by an aggrieved party under this rule, no matter what,” O’Boyle said. “There will be lawsuits.” Vickie Patton, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, told reporters on a Thursday call she believes the EPA’s final rule will be on “strong” legal footing. “They’ve really followed the law, and they have also a very rigorous record,” Patton said. This story has been updated with additional information."

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion. It’s hard to truly comprehend how difficult and relentless a problem climate change is for a country as large as India. One way would be to rig a drone with a very large battery pack and fly it from one end to the other. Start in the south in Bangalore, India’s Silicon Valley, in the fall of 2022. Fly very, very slowly northwards until you reach the Himalayas just before the national elections that started this week. You would witness a country in constant convulsion. Soon after take off, you’d see the swish houses and gleaming towers of Bangalore’s new tech and corporate elite submerged amid September 2022’s monsoon rains. Just a little further north and a few months on in March 2023, record breaking fires tear through Karnataka state’s forests, the smoke obscuring vision for days. Then, on to the heaving, humid metropolis of Mumbai at summer’s onset in April 2023 to find over a dozen people dead, mostly women, due to heat exposure at a large public gathering. Next, entire stretches of Delhi under water from flooding in July. That same summer, hospitals in the sunburnt state of Uttar Pradesh, home to over 240 million people, fill with listless, heat-stroked workers. Finally, the anticipated visual reprieve of the Himalayan snow caps that never comes — instead replaced by an almost snowless winter that continues into 2024. The impacts of India’s extreme weather are not neatly contained within the country’s borders. This is a global worry. When India introduces wheat export bans due to a heat wave or slows its vaunted IT exports because Bangalore is underwater, the lives of seemingly unconnected millions across the world are affected. India is the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the US. It is also the world’s fastest-growing major economy. How India handles climate change, then, is everyone’s concern. But while climate is mentioned in the election manifestos of the two main parties — the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress — it will, perhaps surprisingly, not feature as a major issue in India’s six-week-long national election that started this week. That’s unlike in Australia, the UK and US, among others, where elections can be significantly influenced by climate policy positions. This is because climate politics looks different in the developing world; it will shape Indian elections in definitive but under-the-radar ways. Climate impacts do shape voter demands — though this tends to filter through as anxieties about livelihood and continued welfare support, rather than in a neatly defined area of politics labeled “climate.” You can see it in farmers asking for loan waivers and irrigation facilities after years of drought, in urban families demanding reduced electricity prices to offset cooling bills and in calls for more penetrating social welfare. Here in the world’s most-populous country, the average Indian does not emit very much at present. India’s relatively low per-capita carbon emissions of 1.9 tons per person are less than half of the global average of 4.7 tons per person — and several times lower than developed economies. This duality — low per-capita emissions and a rapidly growing economy — also shapes India’s climate policy. The incumbent government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has both pushed the rapid deployment of renewables and domestic green manufacturing to create jobs, while continuing to rely on fossil fuels to power the economy. That’s fairly similar to previous governments. Leaf through the BJP and Congress’ election manifestos and you will find several dozen pledges across sectors that could be filed under climate policy, with a roughly even split between the two parties (though their emphases predictably differ). But these are listed across several chapters and rarely mention the word “climate” (though each has a separate chapter on sustainable development). Similarly, stump speeches throughout this campaign season have not featured climate change as a central issue. Parties do however focus on climate-adjacent developmental issues — including expanding entitlements for the poorest (which could also help with weather shocks), creating jobs through green manufacturing and reconfiguring Indian agriculture. But politics here seems to reflect the relative insignificance of climate change as a conceptual category in the Indian voter’s mind. When tens of thousands of farmers marched through Maharashtra in 2018 after several years of drought across parts of the state, they protested against rising agricultural debt, declining productivity, pests and inadequate irrigation. This was a climate protest in all but slogan. Take for example a Muslim woman I spoke with a few years ago from the poorer reaches of North Bengal. Her small house in an informal settlement in Delhi was engulfed in a summer fire, and then a few years later her family home in Bengal was damaged in a monsoon flood. She supports a large family of children and grandchildren as a house cleaner in Delhi’s rich neighbourhoods. Despite the fingerprint of climate impacts on her past, her main demands in previous elections were for regular water (which she gets once in two weeks from a water truck), cheaper electricity (she told me she pays around three times the price her rich employers pay because of an illegal connection), and cheaper health care. Elections turn, then, on meeting developmental exigency. The headwinds of climate change are absorbed by the electoral machine and emerge as end-of-tailpipe policies rather than grand climate strategy. This pattern of climate politics is reinforced by seemingly low recognition in India of climate change as a problem. In a 2022 survey of over 4,500 individuals across the country, over 50% of respondents said they knew little or nothing about climate change. Interestingly, recognition of climate change increased to over 80% in that survey when respondents were supplied with a short description of the phenomenon. The hotch-potch of ad hoc policy fixes that emerges around climate issues will only get the country so far. It fails when put to the long-term test. Mobilizing large amounts of public finance to redesign cities to trap less heat and flood less, for example, requires a genuine public debate about a climate-ravaged future. Immediate investments are necessary to dull the blow tomorrow. The climate crisis also deepens the case for global cooperation. India’s climate-outages are going to be hard for trading partners and global markets to ignore as its economy grows. Domestic politics that focus on immediate developmental goals rather than long-term climate-proofing creates a gaping hole that global adaptation finance must fill. This has a moral dimension, too. The climate impacts buffeting India today are largely because of the historical emissions of developed counterparts. Global resilience must be a priority in an interconnected world. The climate impacts buffeting the most populous nation on earth aren’t just a domestic issue — they’re an international one. Tamanna Dalal, of the Sustainable Futures Collaborative, assisted the author with research."

Some scientists are raising red flags,04-22-2024,"                                                 In Singapore, a new plant will turn CO2 from seawater and air into the same material as seashells, in a process that will also produce “green” hydrogen                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","Editor’s Note: CNN Films ”Blue Carbon: Nature’s Hidden Power” takes viewers from the mangroves of Vietnam to the salt marshes of France to investigate a powerful new ally in the battle to slow climate change. It premieres at 9 p.m. ET/PT Sunday, April 21. On a slice of the ocean front in west Singapore, a startup is building a plant to turn carbon dioxide from air and seawater into the same material as seashells, in a process that will also produce “green” hydrogen — a much-hyped clean fuel. The cluster of low-slung buildings starting to take shape in Tuas will become the “world’s largest” ocean-based carbon dioxide removal plant when completed later this year, according to Equatic, the startup behind it that was spun out of the University of California at Los Angeles. The idea is that the plant will pull water from the ocean, zap it with an electric current and run air through it to produce a series of chemical reactions to trap and store carbon dioxide as minerals, which can be put back in the sea or used on land. It’s a compelling vision of a potential solution in the face of a worsening climate crisis that has fueled unprecedented heat and devastating extreme weather. Efforts to rein in global heating remain hugely off track, and many scientists are now warning that, in addition to rapidly reducing fossil fuels, the world will also need to remove carbon pollution humans have already pumped into the atmosphere. This Singapore plant is one example of a slew of recent projects that are looking to the oceans, which already absorb almost 30% of humanity’s planet-heating pollution, as a tool to do this. Other projects include sprinkling iron particles into the ocean to stimulate CO2-absorbing phytoplankton, sinking seaweed into the depths to lock up carbon and spraying particles into marine clouds to reflect away some of the sun’s energy. But carbon-removal projects are controversial, criticized for being expensive, unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuels. And when they involve the oceans — complex ecosystems already under huge strain from global warming — criticisms can get even louder. There are “big knowledge gaps” when it comes to ocean geoengineering generally, said Jean-Pierre Gatusso, an ocean scientist at the Sorbonne University in France. “I am very concerned with the fact that science lags behind the industry,” he told CNN. Equatic’s technology, which has been tested in small pilot projects in LA and Singapore, requires three main ingredients: seawater, rocks and electricity. It works like this: The plant pumps in seawater and runs an electric current through it, separating it into four components: two liquids, one acid and one alkaline, and two gases, hydrogen and oxygen. The acidic water will be mixed with crushed rocks to get the pH back to the same levels as seawater and then sent back into the ocean. Fans will pump air through the alkaline stream, which causes carbon dioxide to form solid calcium carbonate, the material from which seashells are formed, which will look like a fine sand, as well as dissolved bicarbonate. The solid and dissolved minerals, which Equatic says can lock up carbon for at least 10,000 years, will be returned to the ocean or used on land. The seawater will also be sent back into the sea, ready to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. None of the processing happens out in the open ocean, said Gaurav Sant, an Equatic founder and professor of sustainability at UCLA, “this is important because it allows you to measure everything that you’re doing perfectly.” This includes the electricity the plant uses as well as the amount of carbon locked away. The $20 million facility will be fully operational by the end of the year and able to remove 3,650 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, said Edward Sanders, chief operating officer of Equatic, which has partnered with Singapore’s National Water Agency to construct the plant. That amount is equivalent to taking roughly 870 average passenger cars off the road. The ambition is to scale up to 100,000 metric tons of CO2 removal a year by the end of 2026, and from there to millions of metric tons over the next few decades, Sanders told CNN. The plant can be replicated pretty much anywhere, he said, stacked up in modules “like lego blocks.” As the plant scales up, they will need to make sure there aren’t negative impacts, Sant told CNN. “There’s a big difference whether you do this on a scale of one ton, versus a million tons, versus a billion tons. You need to measure, you need to monitor, you need to adapt.” The upfront costs are high but the company says it plans to make money by selling carbon credits to polluters to offset their pollution, as well as selling the hydrogen produced during the process. Equatic has already signed a deal with Boeing to sell it 2,100 metric tons of hydrogen, which it plans to use to create green fuel, and to fund the removal of 62,000 metric tons of CO2. For some critics, however, the risks far outweigh the benefits. Lili Fuhr, the director of the fossil economy program at the Center for International Environmental Law, criticized the use of “speculative technology” at a time when “climate change is already killing our oceans.” Processing vast amounts of seawater could kill marine life, Fuhr told CNN. “We already know that power plants kill fish larvae and other marine life. Equatic would process much more seawater per plant than a power plant,” she told CNN, “And thousands of such plants would be needed to make any meaningful impact on the global climate.” The impacts would need to be closely monitored, said James Niffenegger, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, who wrote a report on ocean carbon removal. The “artificial movement of water at this scale is going to be massive,” he told CNN. The process could also potentially disrupt the delicate balance of ocean chemistry, Niffenegger said. While there is plenty of research into the negative impacts of ocean acidification, there is much less on what might happen if the ocean becomes more alkaline. There are indications the impacts may be low, he added, but “we’re not going to be able to understand the potential of this solution until we start actually deploying this kind of thing.” Then there are the energy requirements — as the world moves away from fossil fuels, the demand for clean energy is increasing  exponentially. “Moving seawater would require vast amounts of renewable energy that would be better used to displace fossil fuels in the first place,” Fuhr said. It’s a point echoed by Gatusso, who said “justice must be considered when precious electricity is used to remove carbon rather than providing it to populations in need.” Equatic said it filters the seawater to ensure marine life does not enter the system, and that water discharged back into the ocean will have the same composition as normal seawater and will comply with Singapore’s environmental guidelines. The company also said the production of hydrogen, which could be used to power the process, means its overall energy use is lower than other carbon removal methods. Equatic’s project encapsulates a broader debate among those who fear rushing into geoengineering could unleash untold damage on ecosystems, versus those who believe the climate crisis is so acute this technology must be an option. It’s clear which side Equatic is on. “Inaction is not a climate strategy,” said UCLA’s Sant, adding that it’s vital to be able to make decisions with uncertainty. “If we’re serious about mitigating the trajectory of climate change,” Sant said, “we need to be willing to move, and move quickly at scale.”"

","Donald Judd and Ella Nilsen, CNN","President Joe Biden traveled to Triangle, Virginia, Monday to mark Earth Day, unveiling $7 billion in grant funding for solar power under the Inflation Reduction Act and announcing new steps to stand up his administration’s American Climate Corps – a program popular with youth climate groups. The announcements come days after the Biden administration made several significant conservation announcements, including barring oil drilling on nearly half of the national petroleum reserve in Alaska. Biden touted his climate and clean energy record against a backdrop of green trees in Virginia. He called the climate crisis an “existential threat” that requires “full and clear action.” “As president, I’ve seen the devastating toll of climate firsthand,” Biden said, speaking of wildfires, extreme weather and deadly heat. “Despite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there are still those who deny the climate is in crisis. They want to take us backwards. I’m determined – absolutely determined [that] we move forward.” Under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Solar for All program, the administration announced funding awards to states territories, tribal governments, municipalities and nonprofits “to develop long-lasting solar programs that are targeted towards the communities and people who need them most,” EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe told reporters during a Friday call. Per McCabe, the funding will enable nearly one million households in low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from solar power, saving more than $350 million in electric costs annually and more than $8 billion over the life of the program for overburdened households. Biden also announced new action on the federal Climate Corps – a workforce training and service initiative aimed at preparing young Americans for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience. The government will ease Climate Corps members’ transition to other federal jobs after they graduate from the program. Biden said service programs like the Climate Corps bring “out the best in young people to do what’s best for America.” “You’ll get paid to fight climate change, learning how to install those solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands, weatherize homes, and so much more,” Biden added. He also announced a new partnership between the administration and TradesFutures, the non-profit arm of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, allowing Climate Corps members to access some of the union’s apprenticeship programs. He also touted an announcement from three states — Vermont, New Mexico and Illinois — launching their own state-based climate corps. Climate corps programs will employ people doing conservation work, as well as work constructing renewable energy like wind and solar. Biden and other progressive lawmakers, including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, delivered remarks in Virginia’s Prince William Forest Park, a site developed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps, on which the American Climate Corps is modeled. “In the midst of a depression, President Roosevelt called on the American people to come together, to take on the challenge and unlock the opportunity that sat inside of that– the opportunity to heal, to lift folks up, and to move America forward,” White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said Friday. “President Biden will talk about how the United States, in the face of a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together.”"

There are always helpers.”                                             ","Bill Weir, CNN Chief Climate Correspondent","This is Bill Weir’s fourth letter on Earth Day to his young son. His new book, “Life As We Know it (Can Be),” is available now in stores. Dear River, This is your fourth Earth Day, and so much has happened in your little lifespan that what started as an annual record of anger and regret has grown into a book full of hopeful solutions. There are still dark days to be sure, and since you love animals so much, I can’t bring myself to explain just how many of your favorites are on extinction’s brink. But so much has happened that I wake with more wonder than worry; when disasters strike, I remember the advice of Mister Rogers, who taught me that every time there is a scary event on TV, “Look for the helpers. There are always helpers.” And while technology in the hands of the soulless can divide us, it can also connect the helpers in ways that can save entire ecosystems. So, on this Earth Day, kiddo, let’s focus on a win. I recently stumbled upon an Earth repair success story in the wilds of South America. It stars a family of little monkeys with big white hair. They were snacking on fruit and nectar, bouncing through the forest overstory when we first locked eyes. “You guys have no idea how lucky you are,” I muttered at the Dr. Suess faces peering through my long lens. Cotton-top tamarins are known locally as titis, and while only a few thousand remain in the shrinking forests of northwest Colombia, the family I saw is among the safest in the world thanks to one woman watching them with affection from below, hundreds of helpers watching monitoring them through a satellite from above, and a very long series of fortunate events. The fate of the titis really began to turn when a woman I met in the jungle began her career as landscape architect, was hired to help build a zoo in Barranquilla and first fell in love with the cotton-topped titi. “I mean, how could you not?” Rosamira Guillen laughed, gesturing up at the family above. When she learned that the illegal pet trade and slash-and-burn cattle ranching were erasing a species that lived only in her homeland of Colombia, her architect mind suddenly shifted from building zoos to rebuilding forests. And River, it didn’t take long to understand that this job could not be done by dropping seeds from drones. It would take shovels and sweat and an intimate acre-by-acre knowledge of the ecology. It would take community organizing and youth education and economic development so the titi’s human neighbors wouldn’t need to cut down trees and poach animals to survive. But to connect enough fragmented habitat for the remaining gene pool to thrive, she would need land. And the cooperation of cattle ranchers who do not share her love for toy-sized primates. “I would be happy to just hang out with the monkeys and in the forest than to have to interact with people,” she laughed as we bumped over dirt roads in her worn pickup, and described how wanton deforestation can change water cycles and trigger ecosystem crash. “In a country like Colombia, where there’s so many challenges, people don’t realize that if you screw up the forest we’re all going to be screwed. The ranchers see us as romantic,” she laughed with grim resignation. But still, Rosamira wanted to be a helper, and in a search for funding met an American super-helper named Charlie Knowles. As the scion of a family that invented the small microphones used in everything from Apollo spacecraft to Richard Nixon’s office to the iPhone, Charlie went into software and made enough of a fortune to retire at 34. Inspired by the story of biologist Laurie Marker who sold all her possessions and moved to Namibia to save cheetahs, Charlie told me he felt the same calling but knew that he had none of the skills required. “What are my core competencies?” he asked himself. “I’m really good at throwing parties and raising money.” With a cheetah borrowed from a petting zoo as a conversation starter, his first party raised $5,000, and with kindred souls from Silicon Valley, he set out to disrupt the world of nature philanthropy. “I became really frustrated by the lack of transparency,” Charlie told me. “I didn’t feel I knew where my money was going or what the impact it was having.” So – alongside Akiko Yamazaki, John Lukas – Charlie co-founded the Wildlife Conservation Network and instead of telling donors to simply write a check and trust the process, WCN set out to create venture capital for animals like the titi and helpers like Rosamira. They created expos to connect philanthropists in wealthy American suburbs with data-proven, wilderness-restoring, boots-on-the-ground conservationists. And they helped those folks make their operations more efficient and effective and often expanded their original vision of what was possible. More than 20 years later, Charlie tells me that WCN supports hundreds of projects around the world with raves from the likes of Jane Goodall and a rare perfect score of 100 from the watchdog Charity Navigator. One million-dollar donation funded over 200 scholarships for kids to study conservation. Another donor personally installed over 50 solar power arrays around the world. And at an expo in 2006, the fate of the titis turned for the better when the Vargas family walked in. “I told my 12-year-old daughter, Kira, to go interview all the conservationists at the expo,” Chris Vargas told me. As another successful tech entrepreneur with a heart for wildlife and some money to give, he was searching for maximum bang for his buck. “And on the drive home. I said, ‘Who is your favorite?’ Mine was Rosamira. She’s Steve Jobs and Jane Goodall all wrapped into one. Her energy, her passion, her clarity of purpose and her just sheer ingenuity,” Chris said. “But I wanted my daughter’s vote, without missing a beat she goes, ‘Daddy, you know that that woman from Colombia? Rosamira? She was my favorite’. So we high fived.” For 18 years, the Vargas family would support Rosamira as she revived her corner of Colombia, one tree at a time. But when she needed $1.2 million to buy nearly 1,000 acres of neighboring ranchland, Chris needed to find more helpers. “We thought, ‘Why don’t we just build a website? And build a technology that lets anybody in the world click on a map, pick an acre, pick ten acres, pick 50 acres, and get all that feedback one exactly what happened with your money.’” Combining the eyes of a satellite and the hearts of nature lovers, Chris began an experiment in crowdsourced conservation he called ReWorld. For a one-time donation of around $1,200, he promised to secure two-and-a-half acres of degraded Colombian forest, bring it back to life and preserve it for the titis forever. Thanks to real-time images from the satellite, the donors would be able to watch their hectare grow from scrub brush and dirt into trees that look like broccoli tops from the sky. River, after we watched the cotton-topped titis pass by, I followed Rosamira’s team to a shady gully where I planted a tree dedicated to you and your sister, Olivia. We flew home, and after my story of the titis aired just once on CNN, enough helpers pitched in to buy the ranch. I just got word that Rosamira signed the papers today. “It may take a day to cut a hectare of forest,” she told me as we hiked past her plantings and into a meticulous greenhouse. “But to rebuild it, it takes about 20 years.” What happens now? Well, Charlie and Chris are hoping the developed world will build trustworthy and verifiable carbon and biodiversity credit markets to help fund operations like Project Titi, though they both admit it will be incredibly complicated. Still, River, when days get dark and I feel that need to look for the helpers, I sometimes flash to the series of fortunate events that gave almost 1,000 acres of forest to the titis — and I imagine all the spots that need similar love. With enough helpers, what else is possible? Editor’s note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action."

Here’s what that could mean for weather and climate,04-23-2024,"                                                 Mount Ruang’s potential impacts to weather and climate are starting to come into focus, even as the danger posed by the volcano persists.                                             ","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","When Mount Ruang in Indonesia underwent multiple explosive eruptions last week, volcanic gases were flung so high they reached the atmosphere’s second layer, tens of thousands of feet above ground. Ruang’s eruptions ejected a massive ash plume and sent some volcanic gases more than 65,000 feet into the air, according to satellite estimates – about 25,000 feet higher than a commercial airplane will typically fly. The eruption’s potential impacts to weather and climate are starting to come into focus, even as the danger posed by the volcano persists and evacuations continue. It’s possible for volcanoes to have a short-term impact on the climate – including global temperature cooling – due to the gases they inject high into the upper atmosphere. But Mount Ruang’s influence on the climate will likely be minimal, according to Greg Huey, the chair of Georgia Tech’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. And the day-to-day weather conditions near Mount Ruang – things like temperature, clouds and rain – probably won’t be influenced by the volcano for long, Huey told CNN. Mount Ruang, a 2,400-foot (725-meter) stratovolcano on Ruang Island in Indonesia’s North Sulawesi province, has erupted at least seven times since Tuesday night, the country’s volcanology agency said. Stratovolcanoes can produce explosive eruptions because their cone shape allows gas to build up, according to volcanologists. Volcanic ash is typically a mixture of crushed-up solids – including rocks, minerals and glass – and gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, according to NASA. Crushed-up solids generate a lot of static electricity within ash plumes as they bash into each other, resulting in intense displays of lighting, according to Huey. “The ash itself is short-lived in the atmosphere because it’s heavy, it’s big and it tends to settle out quickly,” Huey told CNN. It’s the gases that are able to reach much higher in the atmosphere. Dense ash near the surface creates hazardous air quality and causes a temporary cooling effect as it blocks out warming sunlight. Once the active eruption stops, ash starts to settle. But ash that reaches the ground can easily be lofted back into the air by breezy winds. Water droplets often cling to ash in the air and form storm clouds that can unload rain or produce additional lightning. Some gases from Mount Ruang’s eruptions climbed so high they punched into the stratosphere, the second layer of Earth’s atmosphere. It’s located just above the troposphere, which is where all life and weather occur. The stratosphere is a very dry place and typically only the gases with a long lifespan –spanning decades – filter up into it, according to Huey. A volcanic eruption is essentially the only natural way for short-lived – less than a few years – gases like sulfur dioxide and water vapor to make it into the stratosphere. Once in the stratosphere, sulfur dioxide and water vapor combine to form sulfuric acid aerosols that create a layer of hazy droplets, according to UCAR. These droplets spread far from their point of entry and remain in the stratosphere for up to three years, reflecting sunlight back into space and causing global temperatures to cool. But the cooling effect lasts longer if more gas makes it into the stratosphere. In 1991, Mount Pinatubo – another stratovolcano – erupted in the Philippines and produced the largest sulfur dioxide cloud ever measured. The eruption poured over 17 million tons of the gas into the atmosphere and led to a global temperature decrease of around 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) that lasted about a year, according to the United States Geological Survey. In comparison, satellite instruments have estimated Mount Ruang has released an around 300,000 tons of sulfur dioxide so far, though it’s unclear how much of that plume made it into the stratosphere. While that amount is quite massive in its own right, it falls well short of the most extreme case, according to Huey. An eruption as large as Mount Pinatubo in 1991 could certainly cool the planet for a few years, though it wouldn’t be able to erase the Earth’s current climate woes caused by planet-warming pollution, and it would come at the cost of tremendous damage to life and property. CNN’s Kathleen Magramo contributed to this report."

The rules are expected to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions from the sector by 75% compared to its peak in 2005. The agency also announced tougher rules for the neurotoxin mercury emitted from their smokestacks and will require safer disposal of toxic wastewater and coal ash, which are byproducts of making electricity. “By finalizing these standards on the same day, we are ensuring that the power sector has the information needed to prepare for the future with confidence,” EPA administrator Michael S. Regan told reporters. “These are the folks who keep the lights on and power our country forward. At the same time, the power sector is also a major contributor to the pollution that drives climate change and threatens public health.” Along with the rollout of several other major rules in recent months, Thursday’s actions are more signs President Joe Biden is trying to cement his climate legacy ahead of the 2024 election and is vying for the votes of climate-conscious young people in November. His Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, spent his presidency rolling back more than 100 environmental and climate rules, including the power plant rules Biden strengthened Thursday. The EPA estimated the power plant rules will prevent nearly 1.4 billion metric tons of planet-warming pollution from entering the atmosphere through the year 2047 – equivalent to taking 330 million gas cars off the road for a year. After a significant court challenge to Obama-era rules prevailed at the Supreme Court in 2022, the new regulations give power generators options to choose how they meet pollution requirements. And the EPA announced in February it would delay its rule-making process for carbon emissions from existing gas plants, which had initially been covered under the agency’s proposal last year. A senior administration official said the EPA was “really confident” it had “carefully crafted” the final rules within the confines of the law. But some industry stakeholders said it was just the opposite. “The path outlined by the EPA today is unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable,” National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson said in a statement, arguing the actions disregard recent Supreme Court rulings. On Thursday, West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey vowed his office would challenge the final EPA rules in court, claiming they would leave power plants “with no other option but to cease operations.” “We will be challenging this rule,” Morrisey said in a statement. “The US Supreme Court has placed significant limits on what the EPA can do – we plan on ensuring that those limits are upheld, and we expect that we will once again prevail in court against this out-of-control agency.” Biden has made combatting the climate crisis a bigger priority than any other president in history, presiding over the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, the nation’s largest-ever climate investment. But while the IRA contained billions in clean energy tax subsidies – a boatload of carrots for power companies to clean up their pollution – the EPA rules serve as a stick. “Until (companies) have to do it, they don’t do it, because it’s just an added cost,” David Doniger, a senior federal strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told CNN. “In this case, there’s both a requirement and a huge financial incentive.” EPA’s pollution rules are less restrictive than the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which was challenged and struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022. Under the rules, utilities can retrofit existing coal or new gas-fired power plants with equipment to capture and store carbon pollution – the method the EPA recommends as the “best system of emissions reduction,” because it is proven and cost-effective. But many other options are on the table. For instance, plants could burn less-polluting fuels, including hydrogen in new natural gas plants or natural gas in coal plants. CNN recently reported the EPA scrapped another proposed “best” recommendation that natural gas plants burn climate-friendly hydrogen, after it was questioned even by environmental advocates who worried the technology is still too nascent and could open the rules to more legal peril. Companies could also choose to retire fossil fuel plants and shift to less expensive and cleaner sources of energy like wind and solar. “If they choose to retire a plant instead of retrofitting it, that’s their choice,” Doniger said. “There’ll be a lot of charges that EPA is mandating this and mandating that, but this has been designed to follow the Supreme Court’s guidance.” The EPA also strengthened the final rules from its original proposal, moving up the retirement deadline for existing coal plants that refuse to outfit with carbon capture, and covering more new natural gas plants than it had originally proposed. Some power generators are unconvinced carbon capture will be the best method to meet the EPA’s requirements. The trade group for utilities, Edison Electric Institute, said in a statement it was concerned about the lack of existing pipes and wells to transport and store the captured carbon. The technology “is not yet ready for full-scale, economy-wide deployment, nor is there sufficient time to permit, finance, and build the CCS infrastructure needed for compliance by 2032,” EEI president and CEO Dan Brouillette said in a statement. The EPA also finalized its strongest-ever standards to cut mercury pollution and harmful particulate matter from coal-fired power plants, including from lignite coal plants, by up to 70%. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin, meaning it is poisonous to the human body and can irreversibly damage the nervous system, kidneys, liver, lungs, digestive system and immune system. Mercury released from power plants may hurt public health in two major ways. If people breathe in the vapor, which is odorless and colorless, it can hurt their lungs, brain and kidneys and can get into their bloodstream. Mercury vapor from coal plants can also travel long distances and fall to the ground in the form of rain, snow and sleet, contaminating land and water and poisoning fish. In addition to the new standards, power plants will have to install continuous monitoring systems looking for emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants like arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel. “This is a really important step,” said Paul Billings, national senior vice president for public policy with the American Lung Association, calling the pollutants “really bad for human health.” In addition, EPA’s rules regulate three types of wastewater generated at coal-fired power plants and address water stored in coal ash ponds – reducing this form of pollution by close to 600 million pounds per year. Finally, EPA is closing loopholes for toxic coal ash – making sure power plants must safely dispose of coal ash previously dumped at unregulated landfills. “Any one of [these rules] individually is a monumental achievement,” said Holly Bender, Sierra Club chief energy officer at the Sierra Club. “Collectively, these rules send a very strong signal to the electric power industry that it is no longer okay to contribute to these significant public health harms.”"

","Angela Dewan, CNN","The record-breaking rain that fell over the United Arab Emirates and Oman this month, triggering deadly floods and chaos, was driven partly by the climate crisis, according to a scientific analysis published Thursday, which pointed directly at humans burning fossil fuels. A team of 21 scientists and researchers, under the World Weather Attribution initiative, found that climate change was making extreme rainfall events in the two countries — which typically fall during El Niño years — between 10 and 40% more intense than they would have been without global warming. Over a period of less than 24 hours between April 14 and 15, the United Arab Emirates experienced its heaviest rainfall in since records began 75 years ago. Dubai — a glitzy desert city accustomed to going months with no precipitation at all — experienced the equivalent of more than a year and a half’s worth of rain in that time, the analysis said. Using scientific models, the team was unable to determine precisely how much more likely climate change had made the floods. However, they concluded global warming was the “most likely” driver of the record rainfall, because the atmosphere in a 1.2-degree warmer world can now hold 8.4% more moisture, which is making extreme rain events more intense. Changing circulation patterns driven by global warming are also increasing rainfall intensity, the analysis noted. Global warming was the only remaining reason they could identify to explain the heavier downpour. The floods killed four people in the UAE, and at least 19 others in Oman, including 10 children whose school bus was swept away in the deluge. The extreme weather caused pockets of flooding in several parts of the UAE that could be seen in satellite images from space. The floods also brought widespread disruption across Dubai. More than 1,000 flights due in and out of Dubai’s airport — the second-busiest in the world — were canceled, and days of delays followed. People were forced to abandon their vehicles on roads inundated by the floods. Three Philippine women working in Dubai died in their car, trapped by waters gushing down the street. The city’s luxurious malls sprung leaks as rainwater seeped through ceilings, and elevators stopped functioning in skyscrapers, forcing residents to climb stairs up dozens of floors. Unable to return home, some motorists slept in their cars due to blocked roads. “The UAE and Oman floods have shown that even dry regions can be strongly affected by precipitation events, a threat that is increasing with increasing global warming due to fossil fuel burning,” said Sonia Seneviratne, a professor at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science in Zurich. The heavy rain across the two countries came from two separate, powerful, storm systems, said Mansour Almazroui from the King Abdulaziz University’s Center of Excellence for Climate Change Research in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He added that record ocean temperatures were playing a role in supercharging the storms. “The Indian Ocean is getting warmer. And the high pressure in the Indian Ocean is surely contributing the rainfall,” he told reporters. The Arabian Peninsula, on which the UAE and Oman sit, occasionally experiences intense bouts of rain in April and May from what’s known as mesoscale convective systems — several thunderstorms that together act as a single weather system. Friederike Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at the Grantham Institute in London, said that studies note that these storms are increasing in frequency. El Niño — a natural oscillation in ocean temperatures that impacts global weather — was also a driving factor in the April rain event, Otto said. However, the focus must be on slowing climate change, she added. “While we can’t stop El Niño, we can stop climate change,” Otto said. “The solution is to stop burning fossil fuels, to stop deforestation,” she said. Deforestation is responsible for at least 12% of global carbon pollution. The UAE’s state-owned energy company, ADNOC, has plans for a major expansion of oil and gas production, as CNN has previously reported. The country was widely criticized for electing ADNOC’s CEO, Sultan Al-Jaber, to chair the UN-backed international climate talks in Dubai last year. The talks had some success, with almost every nation agreeing the world should transition away from fossil fuels. But many fossil fuel-rich countries are still extracting huge volumes of planet-heating coal, oil and gas, and some are even planning to explore for more oil and build new infrastructure. The International Energy Agency has said the world must end new fossil fuel projects if it wants to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a global science-based goal at the center of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Nearly half a year on from the climate talks, “countries are still opening new oil and gas fields,” Otto said. “If the world keeps burning fossil fuels, rainfall in many regions of the world will get heavier and heavier, resulting in deadlier and more destructive floods.” CNN’s Abbas Al Lawati contributed to this report from Dubai."

Now my kids have taken over most of the work.” High temperatures have raised concern this election cycle, as campaigns marked by outdoor political rallies draw thousands of people under the baking sun. The issue was underscored Wednesday, when one lawmaker collapsed from the heat while addressing supporters in western Maharashtra state. The Election Commission, National Disaster Management Authority and IMD formed a task force to minimize the impact of heat waves ahead of polling days and Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting earlier this month to review the country’s preparedness for the hot season. The Election Commission has released guidelines for staying cool at polling stations, including drinking water and carrying an umbrella, and warned against leaving children or pets in parked cars. And in Bihar, election officials have extended voting hours at some polling stations “in view (of the) prevailing heat wave.” Ray said the heat isn’t going to stop him from voting on Friday. “This is the one right we have so of course I will vote, everyone should vote for whomever they want to represent them,” he said. “Of course it would be good if the election took place in a cooler time but whether I go to vote or not, I am still going to feel hot so that’s not going to stop me.” Despite the heat warnings, the Election Commision said there are “no major concerns for heat waves” during Friday’s polling and weather forecasts indicate “normal conditions” for the constituencies voting. India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4 billion people, often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June. But in recent years, they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged, with scientists linking some of these longer and more intense heat waves to the climate crisis. In 2022, a heat wave that killed 90 people across India and Pakistan was made 30 times more likely because of climate change, the World Weather Attribution initiative found. Last year successive heat waves hit India again, closing schools, damaging crops and putting pressure on energy supplies. In June alone, temperatures in some parts of the country soared to 47 C (116 F), killing at least 44 people and sickening hundreds with heat-related illnesses. The human-caused climate crisis is already threatening India’s development goals and putting millions of people at risk in a nation where more than 50% of the workforce is employed in agriculture, studies have found. By 2050, India will be among the places where temperatures have passed survivability limits, according to climate experts. But analysts say climate has not featured as a major issue this election, despite being mentioned in the election manifestos of the two main parties — the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress. “Climate impacts do shape voter demands — though this tends to filter through as anxieties about livelihood and continued welfare support, rather than in a neatly defined area of politics labeled ‘climate’,” said Aditya Valiathan Pillai, fellow and coordinator for adaptation and resilience at the New Delhi-based Sustainable Futures Collaborative, in a recent op-ed for CNN. “You can see it in farmers asking for loan waivers and irrigation facilities after years of drought, in urban families demanding reduced electricity prices to offset cooling bills and in calls for more penetrating social welfare.” Extreme heat has already had an impact across the region this year with little respite from merciless heat and humidity for hundreds of millions of people living in areas most vulnerable to climate change. Neighboring Bangladesh is sweltering through a heat wave this week with prolonged temperatures above 40 C in many districts and no relief during record hot nights, according to climatologist Maximiliano Herrera. The government declared a “heat alert” across the country on Thursday, in place for 72 hours. Extreme temperatures are also soaring across Southeast Asia, with dozens of heatstroke deaths report by local media in Thailand, hundreds of schools closed in the Philippines, and droughts drying up rice fields and rivers in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta “rice bowl” region. The weeks-long heat wave in Vietnam has forced three provinces to declare a state of emergency as salt seeps into fresh water sources, limiting access to drinking water for more than 70,000 households, according to Save the Children. A report released Tuesday by the World Meteorological Organization found that Asia remained the world’s most disaster-affected region in 2023 and the region is heating up faster than the global average."

","Angela Dewan, CNN","The Group of Seven nations announced Tuesday its member nations would end the use of “unabated” coal by 2035, but left the door open for countries to stretch that deadline in particular contexts. In a communiqué published after talks between energy, climate and environment ministers in Turin, Italy, the group announced it had committed to “phase out existing unabated coal power generation in our energy systems during the first half of 2030s,” in a climate policy breakthrough that G7 negotiators had previously failed to achieve in several years of talks. But by referring to “unabated” coal, the agreement leaves room for countries to use the fossil fuel past 2035 if their carbon pollution is captured before entering the atmosphere. The agreement also includes a caveat that countries could choose “a timeline consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5°C temperature rise within reach, in line with countries’ net-zero pathways.” That caveat appears to allow those countries to keep using coal past 2035, as long as their overall national emissions won’t contribute to global warming of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Science shows that some of the planet’s ecosystems will reach tipping points or struggle to adapt beyond that point. Several members of the G7, which represents the biggest economies in the developed world, have already come close to ending the use of coal. Coal makes up less than 6% of the electricity mix in the UK, Italy and Canada, and almost nothing in France. But it still comprises 32% of Japan’s electricity mix, 27% of Germany’s and 16% of the US’, according to the think tank Ember. The agreement comes just days after the US Environmental Protection Agency announced new rules that will require coal-fired power plants to either capture nearly all of their climate pollution or shut down by 2039. CNN has reached out to the White House and State Department for comment. When questioned by journalists on the caveats in the G7’s agreement, Italian Environment and Energy Security Minister Gilberto Pichetto Fratin defended the agreement, saying the language shows “G7 countries undertake to phase out the use of coal, without jeopardizing the various countries’ economic and social equilibrium.” The language is weaker than what UK minister Andrew Bowie told a reporter on Monday: that the group had agreed to end coal by 2035, making no reference to unabated coal or wiggle room in the timeline. Despite the caveats, several climate policy experts welcomed the announcement, describing it as a breakthrough after years of roadblocks on the issue. “Stamping an end date on the coal era is precisely the kind of leadership we need from the world’s wealthiest countries,” said Jennifer Layke, the global director for energy at the World Resources Institute. “This decision provides a beacon of hope for the rest of the world, showing the transition away from coal can happen much faster than many thought possible.” But the think tank Climate Analytics said that, while the announcement would put pressure on Japan, the only G7 member that hasn’t set an end date for coal, the 2035 deadline is too late to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. An analysis by the think tank shows all coal use in G7 nations needs to end by 2030 at the latest – and natural gas use should end by 2035 – to prevent global warming exceeding the 1.5-degree threshold. “Many of these countries have already publicly committed to phase out dates ahead of 2030, and only have a small amount of coal capacity anyway,” said Jane Ellis, head of climate policy at Climate Analytics. It’s notable that a gas phase-out was not mentioned, Ellis added. “In the last decade, gas has been the largest source of the global increase in CO2 emissions, and many G7 governments are investing in new domestic gas facilities. This is absolutely the wrong direction to be heading in – both economically and for the climate.” G7 should make the transition to renewables faster, Ellis said. Fossil fuels are the primary driver of the climate crisis, and coal is typically the most polluting of all fossil fuels. But putting an end date on coal has been highly controversial. Japan has blocked progress on the issue at past G7 meetings, CNN has previously reported. Almost every country in the world agreed last year to transition away from fossil fuels at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai, but failing to put an end date on coal was seen as a shortcoming of those negotiations. The G7 typically leads on global climate policy. The group’s decisions often trickle down or influence the wider G20, which includes other big emitters, like China and India, as well as major fossil fuel producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. This story has been updated with additional information. CNN’s Ella Nilsen and Laura Paddison contributed to this report."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/climate-crisis-how-to-help-wellness/index.html,The climate crisis is underway. Here are 5 things you can do to help,05/02/2024,                                                 Global warming has unleashed a cascade of unintended consequences and whipped up climate anxiety. CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir has five tips to weather it.                                             ,"Andrea Kane, CNN","It is crystal clear to many people that we are living in a time of climate crisis caused in large part by the burning of fossil fuels , which lead to the emission of greenhouse gasses that trap the sun’s heat, raising temperatures and leading to a cascade of unintended and unwanted consequences. The climate crisis impacts Earth — its land, its atmosphere and its bodies of water — and it also profoundly affects the health and behavior of the planet’s inhabitants large and small, including humanity. And CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir has a front-row seat to the ever-evolving situation. When Weir became a new “old” dad at the start of the pandemic — his son, River, was born in April 2020 (his daughter Olivia was 16 at the time) — he had a revelation. “I looked down at this little squiggling bundle of joy in my arms and realized this kid is going to live to see the 22nd century,” Weir told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on a special episode of the Chasing Life podcast. “And I started writing, sort of, a letter of apology to him for the planet we broke that he was moving into.” That letter eventually became the introduction of Weir’s new book, “Life As We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate, and Hope in a Changing World,” which came out earlier in April, in time for Earth Day. Weir said that everything in our lives depends on a planet in balance — and currently, it’s not. “Five million people die prematurely every year just to, just from particulate pollution of burning fossil fuels around the world,” Weir said. “The heat already kills more people, I think, than all the other disasters combined.” Throughout all of this turmoil, people are all still trying to fulfill their needs, Weir said, pointing to Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. “Layer one is just the stuff that keeps you alive: air, water, temperature around 68 degrees Fahrenheit, (the) right amount of minerals, sleep. If you don’t get those, nothing else matters,” he said. Weir said something clicked for him when he thought about the world his son was inheriting. “What if you can no longer take for granted the bottom of our pyramids, like I did? I never thought about where my water came from or the quality of my air,” he said. “The Earth I joined in 1967 is gone now, and no one knows what kind of planet will replace it,” Weir wrote to River. The planet’s degradation has created climate grief — the mourning of a place we still live in, precisely because it is changing so dramatically under our very feet. Weir draws a parallel between these sentiments and another well-known model: the five stages of grief created by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. “You can take a road trip through America and drive through big swaths of denial,” Weir said. To essentially bargain with rising seas, he said, the city of Charleston, South Carolina, is erecting a seawall and Miami is raising streets. “There’s a lot of anger, a lot of depression. But ultimately, until you get to acceptance, that’s what turns people from survivors into thrivers or leads to a more peaceful end.” Weir said he hopes humanity can get to the acceptance phase quickly, and band together to address the issues facing us. He is optimistic — perhaps surprisingly, given the dire warnings we continue not to heed. What can you do to help the story end well for humanity? Weir has these five tips. Globally, we have got to get our fossil fuel consumption under control. The United States is among the top three greenhouse gas-emitting countries. When we burn fossil fuel for electricity, heat and transportation, the process generates these heat-trapping emissions  . Weir recalls speaking to a fisherman in Maine, who called our addiction to carbon-based fossil fuels a “Godzilla.” “Chopping up ‘Carbon Godzilla’ and putting him back where it came from is humanity’s No. 1 job going forward.” “There are technological ways to do this, various nature-based ways to do it,” said Weir, noting that until that happens at scale, “it’s going to be hard to save this patient.” Take a page from the camel playbook. Camels are originally from Canada but adapted to the heat when they found themselves in the desert, Weir explained. “Twenty-five thousand years ago, the camels were dodging bears and jumping over beaver dams. And that big hump of fat was evolved to give them energy over the winter, and their eyelids were evolved to keep out snowstorms, not sandstorms,” Weir said. “After a couple of camels got lost and wandered across the Bering land bridge into Asia, (they) discovered that all these tools work great in sand and on long hot desert treks.” Humans don’t have time on our side, said Weir, referring to the thousands of years it took camels to evolve, “but we have the technology.” As an example, he cited the whitest paint ever created, which reflects 98% of light back into space and can cool a building by up to 19 degrees Fahrenheit  (10.6 degrees Celsius ). Identify the people making positive changes and support them. Weir said the best tip he ever got for covering a disaster was from Mr. Rogers, who said his own mother told him to “look for the helpers” when he saw a scary event on TV. “There’s always helpers rushing into disasters,” Weir said. When he’s really down, “I need to look for the helpers — not just people who are managing communities in the aftermath of something like the wildfire in Lahaina, or after a hurricane, but also the folks who are looking for better ideas and ways to fix the problem and to create healthier, more sustainable, resilient pieces of our lives.” Become an active member of your community; treat the environment and one another with the same respect and care that many  indigenous communities do. “It is taking care of water and soil and air… (that) fills those (Maslow) needs in ways that we can’t imagine in our modern, convenient world,” he said. “We live in the golden age of self-isolation, whereas we need each other more than ever,” he said. To do that, help in the way best suited to you, whether it’s organizing a rally, putting your expertise to work for a good cause or helping to clean up a neighborhood park. “I just want folks to connect with each other and nature in the best possible ways,” he said. When you have the opportunity, give the environment a break. Think about filling your basic Maslow-pyramid needs in a way that is more sustainable. In his book, Weir reminds us that Maslow wrote, “Man is a perpetually wanting animal.” But, Weir wrote, “he (Maslow) leaves off ‘on a planet with finite resources.’” “(It) doesn’t matter how you draw the Pyramid of Needs; what matters is how you fill it,” Weir wrote. So consider how ﻿you fill it. Maybe reduce your dependence on single-use plastics; walk to the market instead of driving; take into consideration the carbon footprint of your diet; take care not to waste food, water, materials, clothing. Small things add up. Listen to the full episode here .

Here’s what that could mean for the US,04-29-2024,"                                                 It may be spring, but it’s not too soon to look ahead to summer weather, especially when El Niño – a player in last year’s especially brutal summer – is rapidly weakening and will all but vanish by the time the season kicks into gear.                                             ","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","It may be spring, but it’s not too soon to look ahead to summer weather, especially when El Niño – a player in last year’s especially brutal summer – is rapidly weakening and will all but vanish by the time the season kicks into gear. El Niño’s disappearing act doesn’t mean relief from the heat. Not when the world is heating up due to human-driven climate change. In fact, forecasters think it could mean the opposite. El Niño is a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. When the water gets cooler than average, it’s a La Niña. Either phase can have an effect on weather around the globe. By June, forecasters expect those ocean temperatures to hover close to normal, marking a so-called neutral phase, before La Niña builds in early summer, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. But the strength of El Niño or La Niña’s influence on US weather isn’t uniform and varies greatly based on the strength of the phenomena and the season itself. The influence of El Niño or La Niña on US weather isn’t as clear-cut in the summer as it is in the winter, especially during a transition between the two phases, said Michelle L’Heureux, a climate scientist with the Climate Prediction Center. Temperature differences between the tropics and North America are more extreme in the winter, L’Heureux explained. This allows the jet stream to become quite strong and influential, reliably sending storms into certain parts of the US. In the summer, the difference in temperature between the two regions isn’t as significant and the obvious influence on US weather wanes. But we can look back at what happened during similar summers to get a glimpse of what could come this summer. In short: It’s not cool. The summer of 2016 was one of the hottest on record for the Lower 48. La Niña conditions were in place by midsummer and followed a very strong El Niño winter. Summer 2020 followed a similar script: La Niña conditions formed midsummer after a weak El Niño winter but still produced one of the hottest summers on record and the most active hurricane season on record. Then there’s the fact that these climate phenomena are playing out in a warming world, raising the ceiling on the extreme heat potential. “This obviously isn’t our grandmother’s transition out of El Niño – we’re in a much warmer world so the impacts will be different,” L’Heureux, said. “We’re seeing the consequences of climate change.” Current summer temperature outlooks for the US are certainly bringing the heat. Above-average temperatures are forecast over nearly every square mile of the Lower 48. Only portions of the Dakotas, Minnesota and Montana have an equal chance of encountering near normal, above- or below-normal temperatures. A huge portion of the West is likely to have warmer conditions than normal. This forecast tracks with decades of climate trends, according to L’Heureux. Summers have warmed more in the West than in any other region of the US since the early 1990s, according to data from NOAA. Phoenix is a prime example. The city’s average July temperature last year was an unheard-of 102.7 degrees, making it the hottest month on record for any US city. It was also the deadliest year on record for heat in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located. Forecasts also show a worrying precipitation trend for parts of the West. Large sections of the West and the central US are likely to be drier than normal. This dryness, combined with above-normal heat, which only amplifies the dryness, could be a recipe for new or worsening drought. Wetter than normal conditions are in the forecast from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Stormy weather could be a consistent companion for much of the East – but whether it comes from typical rain and thunderstorms or tropical activity won’t be known for months. Heat isn’t the only threat to look out for. The strengthening La Niña conditions, coupled with ocean temperatures which have been at record highs for over a year, could supercharge the Atlantic hurricane season. A warming world generates more fuel for more tropical activity and stronger storms. La Niña tends to produce favorable atmospheric conditions to allow storms to form and hold together in the Atlantic. Early this month, forecasters at Colorado State University released their most active initial forecast ever. “We anticipate a well above-average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean,” the group said in a news release."

","Emily Blumenthal and Monica Garrett, CNN","A nearly 300-year-old settlement once submerged beneath a major dam in the Philippines has reemerged as sweltering heat and drought dry up the reservoir. Structures, including part of a church, tombstones and a municipal hall marker, reappeared in the middle of Pantabangan Dam in Nueva Ecija province in March after months of almost no rain, Marlon Paladin, a supervising engineer for the National Irrigation Administration, told AFP. The area was deliberately flooded in the 1970s in the dam’s construction. But a drought currently affecting about half of the country’s provinces has pushed the dam’s water levels down, according to AFP. Figures from the Philippine government’s weather agency, PAGASA, show those levels on April 30 were nearly 50 meters (160 feet) lower than normal. Paladin told AFP that this is the sixth time the settlement has resurfaced since the creation of the reservoir, but “this is the longest time [it was visible] based on my experience.” When water levels drop, the ruins become a popular tourist attraction, according to AFP. Like much of Southeast Asia, the Philippines has for the past several weeks been hit by scorching heat, leading schools to suspend classes after temperatures hit 42 degrees Celsius (107 degrees Fahrenheit). Although April and May are normally the hottest months in the Philippines, with temperatures averaging in the mid-30s  (high 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), much of the country has seen even hotter temperatures. In the past five days, the heat index in some areas has exceeded 40 degrees (104 degrees Fahrenheit), figures from PAGASA show. Heat index is a calculation of what the human body feels the temperature is like. It takes into account the actual temperature and humidity, which affects the body’s ability to cool itself. The town of Muñoz near the dam has seen heat index over 41 degrees (106 degrees Fahrenheit) the last five days. On Sunday the temperature felt like 47 degrees (117 degrees Fahrenheit) because of other contributing factors. As of the end of March, drought covered much of northern and central Luzon, including Nueva Ecija province where the dam is located, according to PAGASA. April has remained dry across the country, with portions of central and southern Luzon seeing less than 25% of the rainfall they should receive at this time, according to the US Climate Prediction Center. This year, the El Niño climate pattern has exacerbated those conditions, according to AFP. This natural fluctuation comes on top of planetary warming caused by human-driven climate change. In recent years, temperatures in the region — one of the most vulnerable in the world to the effects of climate change — have climbed to unprecedented heights, leaving hundreds of millions suffering in unforgiving heat and humidity, climatologist Maximiliano Herrera told CNN. Last spring, several countries in Southeast Asia experienced record-breaking heat well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. A 2023 report from the World Weather Attribution described that heatwave as a once-in-200-years event that would have been “virtually impossible to have occurred without climate change.” CNN’s Heather Chen, Taylor Ward and Helen Regan contributed reporting."

Last month, the world lived through the hottest April on record, according to new data from Copernicus, the European Union’s climate monitoring service.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","Extraordinary global heat continues its streak. Last month, the world endured the hottest April on record, according to new data from Copernicus, the European Union’s climate monitoring service. It marks 11 consecutive months of unprecedented global temperatures. With that new data point, some scientists warn there is a strong chance 2024 could beat 2023 as the warmest year on record. Last month was 1.58 degrees Celsius warmer than the average April in the era before industrialization and 0.67 degrees above the average April between 1991 and 2020, Copernicus found. The impacts have been stark. Swaths of Asia have been grappling with deadly heat: schools were closed for millions of children in Bangladesh, rice fields have shriveled in Vietnam, and people in India battled 110 degree Fahrenheit temperatures to vote in recent elections. Global ocean heat in April was also record-breaking for the 13th consecutive month. Ocean surface temperatures reached 21.04 degrees, the highest on record for any April, and just a fraction below the overall record set in March, according to Copernicus data. The impact on marine systems is devastating. A mass coral bleaching event occurred this spring, which scientists said at the time could be the worst on record. Unprecedented global heat is being driven by the long-term trend of global warming — mainly caused by humans burning fossil fuels — boosted by El Niño, a natural climate pattern that tends to have a warming impact. El Niño is now weakening, but it’s not surprising the world is still seeing unprecedented heat, said Zeke Hausfather, climate research lead at Stripe and research scientist at Berkeley Earth. The year after El Niño peaks is usually the warmer one. And while heat records are still being set month after month, the margins at which they are being broken are smaller than they were in 2023. The current heat “is much more expected than the shattering of records by 0.3 degrees to 0.5 degrees we saw in the latter half of 2023,” Hausfather told CNN. Hausfather estimates a 66% chance that 2024 will be the hottest year on record, and a 99% chance it will be the second hottest. The current best estimate is it will come in at just above 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, he said. Countries have agreed to restrict global heating to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. While this refers to long-term warming over decades, rather than a single month or year, scientists have said these temporary breaches are a clear and alarming signal of accelerating climate change. What happens in the next few months will help scientists understand if the unexpectedly high temperatures in 2023 were a temporary phenomenon, “or a sign of something new that might drive faster warming than previously anticipated,” Hausfather said. “If global temperatures fall out of record territory after the next two months, it will be a comforting sign that the climate is behaving a bit more predictably,” he added. But, he cautioned, even if this happens, the world is still on track for warming of close to 3 degrees, which would bring catastrophic consequences. While natural climate cycles like El Niño come and go, “increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,” said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus."

","Laura Paddison, Rachel Wilson, Jhasua Razo and Lou Robinson, CNN","The world has passed a clean energy milestone, as a boom in wind and solar meant a record-breaking 30% of the world’s electricity was produced by renewables last year, new data shows. The planet is reaching “a crucial turning point” toward clean energy, according to the Global Electricity Review published Wednesday by climate think tank Ember. It predicts global fossil fuel generation will fall slightly in 2024, before experiencing much bigger declines in subsequent years. It’s a significant step toward the world reaching 60% renewable electricity by 2030, which is critical to meeting global climate goals, said Dave Jones, global insights director at Ember. “The renewables future has arrived,” Jones said. “Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.” A look at the data reveals just how much the global power sector is changing. In 2000, renewables made up less than 19% of the global energy mix. Now they make up more than 30%. Taking nuclear energy into account, the world generated almost 40% of its electricity from low-carbon sources last year. Although global levels of planet-heating pollution reached a record high in 2023, the boom in renewables has pushed the electricity sector’s carbon intensity — the amount of carbon pollution produced per unit of electricity — to a record low in 2023, 12% less than its 2007 peak. The rise of renewables is also pushing fossil fuels into decline, slowing their growth by almost two-thirds over the past decade, the report found. Already, more than half of countries are five years past their peak in fossil fuel-generated electricity. Fossil fuels’ share in the overall electricity mix has fallen from 64.7% in 2000 to 60.6% in 2023. Ember predicts this number will drop significantly in 2024, to 57.6%, as the rapid increase in solar starts to be felt. “We’re going to get that boom in renewables, which will really change the picture very quickly,” Jones told CNN. Solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity in 2023 for the 19th consecutive year, according to the report. It made up nearly twice as much new electricity generation as coal last year. The surge of solar installations happened at the end of 2023, so the full effect is yet to be felt, said Jones. “I think that 2024 will bring a bit of a shock when you start seeing those numbers,” he said, especially among those who assume the demand for fossil fuels such as gas is going to just keep rising. While coal and gas still make up the bulk of global electricity generation, their growth rate last year was far lower than that of wind and solar. “The speed of solar and wind expansion is remarkable and a sign that society can bring about rapid change,” said Niklas Höhne, a climate scientist at the non-profit the NewClimate Institute, who was not involved in Ember’s research. Renewable growth would have been even higher if it hadn’t been for significant drops in hydropower output due to drought in countries such as China and India, the report found. The shortfall was mostly filled by coal. China is far and away the leader on solar, accounting for nearly 36% of global generation last year. But it’s a different story when looking at how big a role it plays in China’s national electricity mix — just 6%, far below many other major solar-producing nations. Solar makes up more than 10% of annual electricity generation in 33 countries, according to the report, including Chile (30%), Australia (17%) and the Netherlands (17%) — and California, the world’s fifth-largest economy, generates 28% of its electricity from solar. Global electricity demand increased to a record high in 2023 — adding the equivalent of Canada’s entire electricity demand — but the rate of growth slowed compared to the average over the past decade. China was the main driver of demand, while the United States and the European Union saw sharp falls amid milder weather and — particularly for the EU — a temporary slump in industrial activity. Electricity demand is set to soar from 2024 onward, Ember’s analysis found. Electric vehicles, heat pumps and electrolysis — the process used to make green hydrogen, a much-hyped clean energy — will increase demand, alongside technologies such as air conditioning and artificial intelligence. The spread of these technologies will increase the growth in electricity demand, but overall demand will decline as electrification is more efficient than fossil fuels, according to the report. Overall, Ember’s report “does provide hope,” said Nancy Haegel, a research advisor at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, who was not involved in the analysis. “It shows that we can generate significant amounts of electricity with renewable energy.” The question is whether the pace of the transition will be fast enough, she told CNN. “Choices in the next 10 years are critical.”"

The carbon can then be injected deep beneath the ground, reused or transformed into solid products. Climeworks plans to transport the carbon underground where it will be naturally transformed into stone, locking up the carbon permanently. It is partnering with Icelandic company Carbfix for this so-called sequestration process. The whole operation will be powered by Iceland’s abundant, clean geothermal energy. Next-gen climate solutions like DAC are gaining more attention from governments and private industry as humans continue to burn fossil fuels. Concentrations of planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2023. As the planet continues to heat up — with devastating consequences for humans and nature — many scientists say the world needs to find ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere in addition to rapidly cutting fossil fuels. But carbon removal technologies such as DAC are still controversial. They have been criticized as expensive, energy-hungry and unproven at scale. Some climate advocates are also concerned they could distract from policies to cut fossil fuels. This technology “is fraught with uncertainties and ecological risks,” said Lili Fuhr, director of the fossil economy program at the Center for International Environmental Law, speaking about carbon capture generally. Climeworks started building Mammoth in June 2022, and the company says it is the world’s largest such plant. It has a modular design with space for 72 “collector containers” — the vacuum parts of the machine that capture carbon from the air — which can be stacked on top of each other and moved around easily. There are currently 12 of these in place with more due to be added over the next few months. Mammoth will be able to pull 36,000 tons of carbon from the atmosphere a year at full capacity, according to Climeworks. That’s equivalent to taking around 7,800 gas-powered cars off the road for a year. Climeworks did not give an exact cost for each ton of carbon removed, but said it was closer to $1,000 a ton than $100 a ton – the latter of which is widely seen as a key threshold for making the technology affordable and viable. As the company scales up the size of its plants and bring costs down, the aim is to reach $300 to $350 a ton by 2030 before hitting $100 a ton around 2050, said Jan Wurzbacher, co-founder and co-CEO of Climeworks, on a call with reporters. The new plant is “an important step in the fight against climate change,” said Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh. It will increase the size of equipment to capture carbon pollution. But, he cautioned, it’s still a tiny fraction of what’s needed. All the carbon removal equipment in the world is only capable of removing around 0.01 million metric tons of carbon a year, a far cry from the 70 million tons a year needed by 2030 to meet global climate goals, according to the International Energy Agency. There are already much bigger DAC plants in the works from other companies. Stratos, currently under construction in Texas, for example, is designed to remove 500,000 tons of carbon a year, according to Occidental, the oil company behind the plant. But there may be a catch. Occidental says the captured carbon will be stored in rock deep underground, but its website also refers to the company’s use of captured carbon in a process called “enhanced oil recovery.” This involves pushing carbon into wells to force out the hard-to-reach remnants of oil — allowing fossil fuel companies to extract even more from aging oil fields. It’s this kind of process that makes some critics concerned carbon removal technologies could be used to prolong production of fossil fuels. But for Climeworks, which is not connected to fossil fuel companies, the technology has huge potential, and the company says it has big ambitions. Jan Wurzbacher, the company’s co-founder and co-CEO, said Mammoth is just the latest stage in Climeworks’ plan to scale up to 1 million tons of carbon removal a year by 2030 and 1 billion tons by 2050. Plans include potential DAC plants in Kenya and the United States. This story has been updated with additional information."

","Heather Chen and Kathleen Magramo, CNN","When temperatures in Cambodia hit a staggering 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) in April, Sek Seila, an 11-year-old student studying in the capital Phnom Penh, was promptly sent home from school. Like hundreds of millions of other children in many parts of South and Southeast Asia, Sek Seila has had to cope with unprecedented setbacks due to record-breaking heat — like sudden school closures, and having lessons and activities canceled or disrupted. School this year has been difficult, he says, adding that stifling heat and high humidity levels in poorly ventilated classrooms have been difficult to endure. “My classroom does not have air conditioning,” Sek Seila told CNN. His class of 43 students pass around mini hand-held fans during lessons on most days to keep cool. “It’s very unpleasant and uncomfortable,” he says. “On some days, it can even get so hot that it feels like your skin is burning.” The hot weather has also been brutal in many South Asian countries where, science shows, climate change has brought stronger and more frequent extreme weather events, like life-threatening heatwaves — leaving nearly half a billion children exposed and vulnerable. A dangerous heatwave hit Bangladesh in April, shutting down schools across the country — many of which were poorly equipped and lacked essential cooling resources, such as fans and air-conditioning, to support and protect students from health risks like dehydration, migraines and heat stroke. More than 33 million children were impacted as a result of the heatwave, according to groups like Save the Children and UNICEF. The worst hit were poor children in rural areas whose families couldn’t afford devices like laptops and tablets to facilitate remote learning, UNICEF says. “It hasn’t been easy for many children in a country as hot as Bangladesh, where they have been facing blast-furnace heat almost every day,” said Sheldon Yett, a UNICEF representative for the region. “This year was hotter than last year and we know that global warming is only going to get worse,” Yett said. “Besides serious health risks, we cannot ignore children’s education needs, which have already been severely impacted after the Covid pandemic.” The UN and its agencies say developing countries are at the forefront of the climate crisis and bear the brunt of prolonged extreme weather like heatwaves, tornadoes and cyclones, as well as severe storms and flooding. “Every child has a right to a safe and healthy environment,” Yett said. “We want to see schools open for children to learn but everything needs to be done in a safe way.” Experts and educators in Cambodia and the Philippines told CNN that March and April have been extremely difficult for schools. “We don’t allow children outside when temperatures get too hot,” said Bong Samreth, who teaches at a public school in Phnom Penh. “But it can feel just as hot and uncomfortable indoors in classrooms without fans or air-conditioning,” he says, adding that he often sees students “sweating through their uniforms” at their desks. “We do our best to look after them, especially the young ones, and the past few months have been very trying.” Climate change continues to impact poverty rates and schools in the Philippines, often ranked as one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change and where schools are still recovering from some of the longest pandemic closures. The educational gap between impoverished Philippine children and those in urban areas has been widening, said child welfare and advocacy group Save the Children Philippines, adding children in rural areas, unable to attend school, have been at a particular disadvantage. It also isn’t uncommon to see groups of up to 70 students crammed into a single classroom with just one or two electric fans for cool air circulation and ventilation, the group says. Volunteers have also raised issues from students about insufficient clean drinking water at school, meaning they cannot keep hydrated during the day — as well as lacking shaded outdoor recreational areas. “Classes have not been consistent,” said Benjo Basas, a social sciences teacher in Manila, adding that “almost the entire month of April” had been disrupted by massive school closures after heat in many areas became unbearable — impacting around 7 million children. Students were unable to concentrate during class, Basas told CNN, an especially stressful issue given that important final-term examinations were just around the corner. Mirasol Mamaat, a high-school teacher in the country’s northern Pangasinan province, said dozens of students had become sick after recent heat index levels — which measure how hot it really feels outside — hit alarming highs of more than 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit). “For some impoverished students, we will do home visits to check in on them and deliver study materials like we did during the pandemic,” she said. Governments in South and Southeast Asia have given practical advice on avoiding heat strokes and heat exhaustion, but few have come up with long term plans to address the worsening effects of the climate crisis. In a directive to all public schools in late-April, Cambodian education minister Hang Chuon Naron announced that school would be reduced by two hours during times of soaring daily temperatures. Students were advised “to drink plenty of water” and to avoid staying out in the sun for too long “without sunshades or protection,” he said. Loose, lightweight and light colored clothing was also advised for students to protect them from sunburns and heat exposure. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday said his administration is looking to revert the upcoming academic year to start in June and end in March, saying it “will be better for the kids.” Much of South and Southeast Asia experiences the hottest temperatures in April, May and June before monsoon rains bring much needed relief. Nonethless, as extreme weather conditions become the norm, meeting the needs of children in poor and vulnerable countries is more important than ever, experts say. “We always say that children will inherit the world but what kind of world are they going to inherit if it’s going up in ashes?” said Joy Reyes, a climate justice lawyer from the Philippines. The impact of pollution driven by the burning of fossil fuels cannot be underestimated, climate experts say. There now needs to be “a fundamental change” among governments about how energy is generated. “Governments have the responsibility of providing clean energy and infrastructure — it should not be left to companies or individuals,” said Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQ Air, an environmental research company that closely monitors global air quality, conditions and temperatures. “Cleaner air, keeping climate change at bay — this needs to be the future.”"

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. It is not news that former President Donald Trump wants to hit rewind on President Joe Biden’s climate policy. What is news is how far Trump may go. There’s new reporting in The Washington Post that Trump, during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, asked oil executives to raise $1 billion for his campaign so that he could upend efforts by Biden to push the US toward clean energy and electric vehicles. While the transactional nature of the pitch, as relayed to the Post, is overt and somewhat shocking, it’s not out of step with Trump’s view of politics or his insistence that climate change is a “hoax.” For evidence that climate change is not a hoax, read this CNN story about ocean temperatures. Or look at the pictures of hundreds of thousands of dead fish killed by a heat wave in Vietnam. I talked to CNN climate reporter Ella Nilsen about Trump’s plans for a second term and Biden’s record on climate change. Among the interesting things  I learned is that a lot of the money Biden and Democrats have spent to spur manufacturing has gone to red states. WOLF: The Washington Post reports that Trump is promising oil executives a friendly administration if they raise $1 billion for his campaign. Politico reports the oil industry is crafting executive orders Trump could sign on day one. Trump has promised – in his “dictator for a day” fantasy – to act on immigration and energy production first. What do we know about how different US energy policy would be under Trump? NILSEN: In his first term, Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in place by the Obama administration. Biden’s administration has spent much of its tenure undoing Trump’s actions – in some places enacting even stronger regulations on planet-warming pollution coming from vehicles, power plants and the oil and gas industry. Trump has vowed to again reverse course from Biden; he wants to give a boost to fossil fuels and oil and gas drilling in particular. WOLF: For all their rhetorical differences on climate, it’s not like the US has cut oil production under Biden. In fact, the US remains the No. 1 world oil producer by a long shot. How do climate activists rate the current administration? NILSEN: Climate activists have a mixed view of Biden. On the one hand, he delivered on the most ambitious piece of climate legislation in modern history. His administration has also finalized some pretty ambitious regulations cutting planet-warming pollution, conserved a lot of public lands and created an American Climate Corps – a key demand of activists. On the other hand, the administration greenlit the massive new oil drilling project in Alaska known as Willow, which galvanized a huge amount of opposition from youth climate groups and on social media. Youth climate groups want Biden to use executive authority to stop drilling for fossil fuels – something that likely won’t happen as oil and gas production booms in the US. WOLF: The money for climate in the  Inflation Reduction Act, which was backed by Democrats only, was sold as the largest-ever investment in clean energy and climate policy. Are we seeing it pay off? NILSEN: Yes, so far. The IRA has already spurred hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in new US manufacturing, largely for clean-energy industries like EVs, battery plants, and solar and wind production. A lot of this funding has been clustered in red states, but other 2024 swing states like Michigan, Arizona and Georgia have been big benefactors. WOLF: Is that a political move, or does it just have to do with the fact that it gets windy in Texas? NILSEN: You’re right, it’s very windy in a lot of red states – red states like Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and South Dakota are big wind-energy producers and consumers. But there are other reasons too. For instance, it’s easier to permit and build in some red states, and others have relaxed union labor laws, another factor that draws big businesses. WOLF: I’ve been seeing a lot of stories about a backlash to EVs. Trump falsely says Biden wants to ban gas-powered vehicles. How big a part does a transition to EVs play in addressing climate change? NILSEN: The vehicles we drive play a huge role in addressing climate change. Transportation emissions account for a little less than a third of total US emissions – the biggest individual sector for greenhouse gas pollution. Even accounting for mining for the critical minerals needed for EV batteries, EVs are much cleaner than gas-powered vehicles – assuming the power used to charge them is also coming from clean sources. WOLF: Even before Biden took office, states like California were taking the lead in a more climate-focused energy policy. Would that continue even if Trump wins? NILSEN: Yes, blue states like California and Washington state and even some Midwestern, purple states like Michigan and Minnesota have passed some very ambitious climate laws through their legislatures. That work will continue in the states even if Trump is elected. But given how quickly we’re running out of time to get the planet’s warming under control, it will be important to have the federal government moving in that direction as well. WOLF: Better than presidents taking executive action or the Environmental Protection Agency writing a regulation to address the climate would be lawmakers passing a major piece of climate legislation. Are there any indications of movement toward a new national energy policy? NILSEN: Lawmakers passing the IRA was a huge achievement in its own right; however, multiple lawmakers have said the IRA was just the start. Given the 2017 Trump tax cuts are expiring soon, and Congress will have to take up tax policy in 2025, there’s already chatter about a possible carbon tax, or a carbon tariff on polluting products like cement and steel, coming up in the legislature. Of course, what’s possible in Congress depends tremendously on which party is in power – and who is in the White House."

Using data taken from temperature instruments during this period, the scientists found the Northern Hemisphere summer in 2023 was 2.07 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial period. But observational data from this period is sparse, uncertain and skews warmer. So, for a fuller picture of how the climate varied naturally before the start of the pre-industrial era, the study authors looked much further into the past. To do this, they used detailed sets of tree ring records from thousands of trees across nine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and Scandinavia, but excluding the Tropics which lack good tree data. Trees act as time capsules. The patterns of their rings – affected by sunlight, rainfall and temperature – provide a climate history for each year of their lives, going back centuries or even thousands of years. This complex tree ring data allowed the scientists to reconstruct annual temperatures for Northern Hemisphere summers between the years 1 and 1849 and compare them to last summer’s temperatures. They found the summer of 2023 was warmer than any other summer during this period. It was at least 0.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the warmest summer during this period, the year 246 – when the Roman Empire still ruled over Europe and the Mayan Civilization dominated Central America. At the other end of the scale, last summer was nearly 4 degrees Celsius warmer than the coldest summer the study identified, the year 536 – when a volcanic eruption pumped out vast amounts of planet-cooling gases. Using this 2,000-year data set, they calculated that the summer of 2023 was 2.2 degrees Celsius hotter than the long-term pre-industrial average, before robust networks of instruments could measure the weather. The study follows a report published in November, which found humanity lived through the hottest 12-month period in at least 125,000 years. The study, and others like it, rely on data extracted from other proxies, such as ice cores and coral reefs, which don’t give the same detailed yearly evidence as tree rings. This makes it hard to compare individual days or even years with those in the past, said Jan Esper, lead author of the study and professor of climate geography at Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany. It is possible – even likely – last year was the hottest in at least 125,000 years, he added, but “we don’t have the data” to say for certain. The deep dive into the year-by-year temperatures of Northern Hemisphere summers is a “worthwhile endeavor,” said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved in the study. What’s impressive, she told CNN, is “we have enough temperature reconstructions from enough places around the world to document the exceptional nature of a single year of large-scale temperature extremes.” This “treasure chest of data” can be used to “sharpen our projections of future climate extremes,” she added. While the study can place the extraordinary Northern Hemisphere heat into historical context, it cannot be applied on a global scale, Esper said. There simply isn’t enough tree ring data from the Southern Hemisphere and the Tropics, he said. The study’s findings are deeply worrying, Esper said. “There are potential irreversible processes in the system, and I am afraid not of myself. I’m old,” he added. “I’m concerned for the kids.” CNN’s Laura Paddison contributed to this report."

Several heat waves spanning a vast area of the Asian continent last month during the world’s hottest April on record were made more intense and likely by the climate crisis, the analysis from the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA) found. The WWA report divided the heat waves into three areas: West Asia, the Philippines and a region spanning South and Southeast Asia. In West Asia, the analysis focused on the Palestinian territories, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan, where temperatures spiked above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) last month. It found climate change made the heat in this region around five times more likely and 1.7 degrees Celsius hotter than it would have been before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. Soaring temperatures had a particularly stark impact on the 1.7 million displaced people in Gaza, already struggling with insufficient water access and inadequate healthcare. There was little respite from the relentless heat for those crammed into makeshift tents and shelters, often covered with plastic sheets. At least three people, including two children, reportedly died from the heat, the analysis notes. In the Philippines, the extreme heat last month — which forced hundreds of schools to close as temperatures reached more than 42 degrees Celsius — had such a strong link to human-caused global warming the report concluded it would have been impossible without it. To calculate the influence of climate change on the extreme heat, WWA researchers used weather data and computer models to compare the world’s current climate — which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels — with the climate of the past. “From Gaza to Delhi to Manila, people suffered and died when April temperatures soared in Asia,” Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment and a report author, said in a statement. “Heat waves have always happened. But the additional heat, driven by emissions from oil, gas and coal, is resulting in death for many people.” The scientists also examined the role of El Niño, a natural climate pattern that influences global weather. While they found it had no influence in West Asia’s April heat, it did affect the intensity of heat in the Philippines, pushing up temperatures by 0.2 degrees Celsius. However, the impact of climate change there was greater, increasing temperatures by about 1.2 degrees. In today’s warmer world, the kind of extreme heat waves experienced in Gaza and West Asia, as well as the Philippines, are not rare and can be expected around once every 10 years, the report found. But it warns worse could be in store. If the planet’s average temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is predicted to happen in the 2040s or 2050s if the world does not decarbonize fast enough, similar extreme heat waves could be expected once every five years in West Asia and every two to three years in the Philippines. The WWA analysis also looked at parts of South and Southeast Asia, many of which also experienced unprecedented heat last month. Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam all broke records for their hottest April day, while temperatures spiked to 46 degrees Celsius (115 Fahrenheit) ﻿in India. Bangladesh and Thailand also experienced scorching April temperatures and were included in the study. Climate change also played a pronounced role in this region, according to the analysis, making the heat 45 times more likely and 0.85 degrees Celsius hotter. The scientists took a simpler approach than usual for this part of Asia, looking only at weather data and not computer models, because the region overlapped with two previous analyses of extreme heat events in 2022 and 2023, which also found climate change played a strong role. The numbers in the report are important, Otto said, “because they show us that everywhere climate change is an absolute game changer when it comes to extreme heat.” But numbers alone don’t necessarily show how bad the impacts are — these depend on people’s vulnerability and exposure. Days of temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) were “particularly difficult for people working outdoors, people living in informal housing (and) people living in refugee camps,” Otto said. Asia is also home to some of the planet’s fastest growing cities, said Carolina Pereira Marghidan, climate risk consultant at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, on a call with reporters. This has led to rapid, unplanned development. “Many cities have seen extreme losses of green space,” Pereira said, increasing the impacts of extreme heat on residents. The world must take “massive, unprecedented steps to reduce emissions,” said Mariam Zachariah, a researcher at the Grantham Institute, in a statement. If not, she added, “extreme heat will lead to even greater suffering in Asia.”"

Ron DeSantis and state lawmakers are going to exceptional lengths to delete many mentions of climate change from state laws.                                             ","Ella Nilsen, CNN","As Florida copes with rising seas and record temperatures, lawmakers are going to exceptional lengths to delete many mentions of climate change from state laws in a new bill that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law on Wednesday, according to his official X account. The wide-ranging law makes several changes to the state’s energy policy – in some cases deleting entire sections of state law that talk about the importance of cutting planet-warming pollution. The bill would also give preferential treatment to natural gas and ban offshore wind energy, even though there are no wind farms planned off Florida’s coast. The bill deletes the phrase ‘climate’ eight times – often in reference to reducing the impacts of global climate change through its energy policy or directing state agencies to buy ‘climate friendly’ products when they are cost-effective and available. The bill also gets rid of a requirement that state-purchased vehicles should be fuel efficient. “Florida rejects the designs of the left to weaken our energy grid, pursue a radical climate agenda, and promote foreign adversaries,” DeSantis said in a post on X, posting a graphic that said the law would protect the state from “green zealots.” “What Florida is really doing is saying we’re going to deemphasize any policies that would help mitigate climate change,” said Emily Hammond, a professor of law at George Washington University. It’s certainly not the first time Republican politicians have deleted the phrase ‘climate change’ – erasing the phrase from government websites was a commonplace activity during the Trump administration. But experts said few other states have passed bills to move away from clean energy and erase climate mentions from their laws. “It goes further than any other state has gone in repealing its existing climate laws,” Michael Gerrard, founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told CNN. Last year was the hottest year on record for Florida, breaking yet another heat record in the state. South Florida in particular observed scorching heat index temperatures that reached as high as 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Sea levels have risen as much as eight inches higher than they were in 1950, already leading to increased flooding from storms and tides alike. “Florida is one of the most vulnerable states in the country,” Gerrard said. “All of South Florida is at great peril from sea level rise. They should be the last state to stand in the way of fighting climate change.” Even as Florida politicians are erasing mentions of climate change from their laws, they are also increasingly focused on helping a storm and flood-prone state withstand climate impacts. DeSantis and state lawmakers have poured over $1.1 billion into increasing community resilience to flooding and storms, according to a 2023 news release from the governor’s office. In 2019, DeSantis appointed the state’s first chief resilience officer Julia Nesheiwat – who explicitly referenced climate change and sea level rise as a “significant challenge” to the state. (Nesheiwat has since left her post and replaced by the state’s current chief resilience officer Wesley Brooks). Florida has also accepted millions of dollars in federal funding to help reconstruct a state highway in Miami Beach – elevating the pavement and installing new pump stations to help clear the road of water during flooding events. When it comes to other federal climate and clean energy funding, however, the state hasn’t been eager to accept. DeSantis vetoed over $29 million dollars in federal energy rebates and energy efficiency grants from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Florida was one of five states that declined to compete for $4.6 billion in federal climate grants, although numerous Florida metropolitan areas including Jacksonville, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa have raised their hands for the funding instead. Hammond and Gerrard said this approach from Florida politicians to fund programs dealing with climate impacts without acknowledging its root cause isn’t surprising. Hammond called focusing on adapting to climate change and hardening infrastructure without attribute it to a warming planet “consistent to the conservative approach.” “They don’t want to acknowledge that climate change is happening; they acknowledge they have flooding,” Gerrard said. “If it’s about moving away from fossil fuels, they don’t like it.”"

","Elizabeth Wolfe, Joe Sutton, Sharif Paget, Mary Gilbert and Eric Zerkel, CNN","Improving winds and a storm moving into western Canada are providing a temporary boost to firefighters battling massive wildfires, but the danger remains heightened as they burn close to three communities. Drought-starved vegetation and days of gusty winds have fueled more than 100 wildfires tearing across Canada that have choked the air with smoke and forced thousands to evacuate since the weekend. But weather conditions took a turn midweek and are providing some help for firefighters working to gain the upper hand on the flames. Winds have died down in some areas and shifted in others, pushing flames away from Alberta’s Fort McMurray, a city still haunted by a catastrophic 2016 fire dubbed “The Beast.” A large, slow-moving storm will also track through western and central Canada from midweek into the weekend. Cooler air from the storm will flow across fire-torn provinces while relative humidity levels rise and chances for rain increase. While the assist from Mother Nature will not last indefinitely, any potential containment is welcome news for the thousands of people whose homes and businesses are at risk. Roads out of Fort McMurray were crammed with evacuating cars Tuesday as an out-of-control 51,000-acre wildfire crept toward the city’s edge. The approaching flames conjured up terrifying memories for residents who lived through the 2016 fires, which forced 90,000 people to evacuate and wrought billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses. Evacuation orders were issued for the city’s neighborhoods of Prairie Creek, Beacon Hill, Abasand and Grayling Terrace on Tuesday. The rest of the city and several surrounding suburbs are on alert to evacuate at a moment’s notice. Roughly 6,600 people in Alberta had evacuated as of Wednesday, local officials said during a Wednesday news conference. Residents can expect to be away from their homes until at least May 21, the regional municipality said in a news release. A veil of thick smoke made it difficult for firefighters to see as they battled “extreme fire behavior,” Tuesday Alberta Wildfire Information Officer Josee St-Onge said. Safety concerns have prompted some firefighters to be removed from the front lines. Officials sought to assuage the concerns of residents who vividly recall the 2016 fires, which tore through more than 1.4 million acres and destroyed about 2,400 homes and businesses – the most expensive natural disaster in Canada’s history. “I want to recognize the anxiety that this brings, certainly to those residents that were here in 2016, and to those where this is their first experience and have heard the stories,” said Regional Fire Chief Jody Butz. “We are confident that we have the resources to defend these areas, but we need people out of harm’s way.” St-Onge said Wednesday less than 1 millimeter of rain fell on the fire overnight. “Active fire behavior is expected today but should be less than yesterday, thanks to cooler temperatures and weaker winds,” she said, adding firefighters would begin establishing a containment line. Currently, 117 firefighters and 21 helicopters have been assigned to the firefight, according to St-Onge. But despite the weather improvements, St-Onge warned there was “a lot of work to be done to contain this fire and we are still expecting high fire activity today.” The country’s wildfire season is off to a troubling pace as new fires ignite each day and dormant so-called “zombie” fires reanimate. The 2024 fire season isn’t yet on par with last year’s record-shattering season but with wildfire behavior worsening in a warming world it’s no wonder Canadian fire officials are warning of an “explosive” season that may rival last year. Hazardous smoke from the blazes has also been wafting into the US and reducing air quality. Degraded air quality levels were in place Wednesday from the Dakotas into Oklahoma. The central US will remain the focal point for Canadian smoke through at least midweek, before it is pushed from the area by an incoming storm system. Multiple blazes exploded in size across several provinces early this week, forcing thousands of Canadians to flee their homes with children, pets and bags stuffed with essentials and cherished possessions in tow. “This is a very difficult time for people who have been asked to leave behind their home, their belongings and their community without the certainty of what will remain when they return,” Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said in a Tuesday statement. Manitoba first responders are tackling one of the largest wildfires in Canada, which has consumed at least 78,000 acres and was within a mile of the Cranberry Portage community as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the province’s media release. More than 500 residents had been evacuated from the area as several neighborhoods were ordered to leave. In British Columbia, more favorable weather conditions helped slow the advance of the northeastern Parker Lake Fire toward the town of Fort Nelson. At least 4,800 people in the area are under evacuation orders, including the Fort Nelson First Nation. Rick Seidel, the owner of a local construction and trucking company, told CNN’s Canadian news partner CBC he stayed back to help fight the flames. “We’ve had all our equipment ready and all our water trucks were loaded. When the call came we jumped into action,” Seidel told CBC on Monday. “It’s really bad. It’s a war zone right now,” Seidel said. Gusty winds are driving ongoing fires in Canada, but the seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change. “This region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,” said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. “As a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.” Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada, according to Environment Canada. Last year was Canada’s most devastating fire season on record, including in British Columbia, where fires burned through hundreds of homes and an area the size of Maryland, according to the BC Wildfire Service. There are more than 130 fires burning across Canada, 42 of which are considered out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Fire Centre. Some of the blazes are so-called “holdover fires” also known colloquially as “zombie fires,” the smoldering remains of last season’s epic blazes, burning deep in the ground throughout the winter and reigniting when exposed to warmer temperatures in the spring. “In the past, the winter conditions are what put out a lot of holdover fires,” said Bowinn Ma, British Columbia’s minister of emergency management and climate readiness. “In this case, what we’ve seen is that due to higher temperatures and persistent drought through the last year, many of these holdover fires were not put out like they normally are.” CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Ocean water is pushing miles beneath Antarctica’s “Doomsday Glacier,” making it more vulnerable to melting than previously thought, according to new research which used radar data from space to perform an X-ray of the crucial glacier. As the salty, relatively warm ocean water meets the ice, it’s causing “vigorous melting” underneath the glacier and could mean global sea level rise projections are being underestimated, according to the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica — nicknamed the “Doomsday Glacier” because its collapse could cause catastrophic sea level rise — is the world’s widest glacier and roughly the size of Florida. It’s also Antarctica’s most vulnerable and unstable glacier, in large part because the land on which it sits slopes downward, allowing ocean waters to eat away at its ice. Thwaites, which already contributes 4% to global sea level rise, holds enough ice to raise sea levels by more than 2 feet. But because it also acts as a natural dam to the surrounding ice in West Antarctica, scientists have estimated its complete collapse could ultimately lead to around 10 feet of sea level rise — a catastrophe for the world’s coastal communities. Many studies have pointed to the immense vulnerabilities of Thwaites. Global warming, driven by humans burning fossil fuels, has left it hanging on “by its fingernails,” according to a 2022 study. This latest research adds a new and alarming factor into projections of its fate. A team of glaciologists — led by scientists from the University of California, Irvine — used high resolution satellite radar data, collected between March and June last year, to create an X-ray of the glacier. This allowed them to build a picture of changes to Thwaites’ “grounding line,” the point at which the glacier rises from the seabed and becomes a floating ice shelf. Grounding lines are vital to the stability of ice sheets, and a key point of vulnerability for Thwaites, but have been difficult to study. “In the past, we had only sporadic data to look at this,” said Eric Rignot, professor of Earth system science at the University of California at Irvine and a co-author on the study. “In this new data set, which is daily and over several months, we have solid observations of what is going on.” They observed seawater pushing beneath the glacier over many miles, and then moving out again, following the daily rhythm of the tides. When the water flows in, it’s enough to “jack up” the surface of the glacier by centimeters, Rignot told CNN. He suggested the term “grounding zone” may be more apt than grounding line, as it can move nearly 4 miles over a 12-hour tidal cycle, according to their research. The speed of the seawater, which moves considerable distances over a short time period, increases glacier melt because as soon as the ice melts, freshwater is washed out and replaced with warmer seawater, Rignot said. “This process of widespread, enormous seawater intrusion will increase the projections of sea level rise from Antarctica,” he added. Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study, called the research “fascinating and important.” “This finding gives a process that, as yet, is not factored into models,” he told CNN. And while these results only apply to certain areas of the glacier, he said, “this could speed up the pace of ice loss in our forecasts.” One uncertainty to be unraveled is whether the rush of seawater beneath Thwaites is a new phenomenon or whether it’s been significant but unknown for a long time, said James Smith, a marine geologist at the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the study. “Either way, it’s clearly an important process that needs to be incorporated into ice sheet models,” he told CNN. Noel Gourmelen, a professor of Earth observation at the University of Edinburgh, said use of radar data for this study was interesting. “Ironically it’s by going to space, using our growing satellite capabilities, that we’re learning much more about this environment,” he told CNN. There are still many unknowns on what the study’s findings mean for the future of Thwaites, said Gourmelen who was not involved in the research. It is also unclear how widespread this process is around Antarctica, he told CNN, “although it is highly likely that this is happening elsewhere as well.” Antarctica, an isolated and complex continent, appears to be increasingly vulnerable to the climate crisis. In a separate study, also published Monday, researchers from the British Antarctic Survey looked at the reasons for the record low levels of sea ice surrounding Antarctica last year. Analyzing satellite data and using climate models, they found this record low would have been “extremely unlikely to happen without the influence of climate change.” Sea ice melting doesn’t directly affect sea level rise because it’s already floating, but it leaves coastal ice sheets and glaciers exposed to waves and warm ocean waters, making them much more vulnerable to melting and breaking up. The researchers also used climate models to predict the potential speed of recovery from such extreme sea ice loss and found that even after two decades, not all the ice will return. “The impacts of Antarctic sea ice staying low for over twenty years would be profound, including on local and global weather,” Louise Sime, a co-author on the BAS study, said in a statement. The findings add to evidence over the last few years that the region is facing a “lasting regime shift,” the authors wrote."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","As vast parts of Florida sweltered in oppressive heat over the weekend, South Florida TV meteorologist Steve MacLaughlin criticized the state’s new legislation that deleted most references to climate change from state law, and urged his viewers to vote. “The entire world is looking to Florida to lead in climate change,” NBC 6’s MacLaughlin said during a May 18 segment. “Our government is saying that climate change is no longer the priority it once was.” MacLaughlin’s comments come as South Florida swelters in exceptional heat for the month of May. The extreme temperatures prompted the National Weather Service to issue the first May heat advisory in 15 years on Friday. The month so far has been the warmest May on record for much of South Florida. Just days earlier, Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a controversial bill that deleted many references of climate change from state laws – a measure that MacLaughlin called in his X post, “Don’t Say Climate Change.” It made several changes to the state’s energy policy, in some cases deleting entire sections that discussed the importance of cutting planet-warming pollution. It also gave preferential treatment to fossil fuel and banned offshore wind energy, even though there are no wind farms planned off Florida’s coast. Florida’s coastal ecosystems have been ravaged by severe coral bleaching and its homes and businesses face inundation from sea level rise. The bill deleted the term “climate” eight times — often in reference to reducing fossil fuel emissions through its energy policy or directing state agencies to buy “climate friendly” products when those products were cost-effective and available. “Please keep in mind, the most powerful climate change solution is the one you already have in the palm of your hands — the right to vote,” MacLaughlin said. “And we will never tell you who to vote for but we will tell you this: We implore you to please do your research and know that there are candidates that believe in climate change and that there are solutions, and there are candidates that don’t.” Other TV meteorologists praised MacLaughlin for delivering such strong remarks, especially during a time where climate communicators, journalists, meteorologists and national weather services have reported an increase in harassment, threats and abuse for connecting extreme weather events to climate change. “This is not an easy statement for a meteorologist to make, as there is a lot of pressure to not wade into these climate waters,” Jeff Berardelli, the chief meteorologist at WFLA in Tampa Bay, said in response to the video clip MacLaughlin had posted on X, which has been viewed more than 350,000 times. “Big kudos to Steve for being bold and honest.” Last year, a chief TV meteorologist at an Iowa news station resigned after receiving a series of harassing emails from some viewers. “This is a time like no other to be courageous,” John Morales, a certified consulting meteorologist at ClimaData and the former chief meteorologist at NBC Miami, said on X, urging more meteorologists to follow suit."

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","The official start of what is likely to be an active Atlantic hurricane season is almost here. While that introduces the threat of tropical trouble across the eastern US, the Gulf Coast states are at even higher risk to a hurricane’s deadliest threat: water. Federal forecasters joined the chorus of expert voices calling for a hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season when NOAA’s National Hurricane Center released its official preseason forecast Thursday. An above average season is expected with between 17 and 25 named storms. Of these storms, 8 to 13 could become hurricanes, 4 to 7 of which could strengthen into Category 3 or stronger. This is the most aggressive preseason forecast issued for NOAA’s hurricane season outlook. “This season is looking to be an extraordinary one in a number of ways,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said at the news conference. The ominous forecast comes as a vast area of the South has been deluged by drenching, flooding storms in recent weeks and dozens of cities from Texas to the Florida Panhandle are having one of their wettest years to date. The soil is saturated, and the more saturated it is, the less time it will take for heavy rain to trigger flooding, Barry Keim, a climatologist with Louisiana State University, explained. Soils in the South typically would be able to absorb a few inches of rain before becoming overwhelmed, but that’s not the case currently, Keim told CNN. After weeks of rain, the ground is already overwhelmed. Now the region is headed into its wettest season: summer. Tropical activity plays a vital role in making it so. As much as 25% of annual rainfall for the Gulf Coast states comes from tropical systems, according to a 2021 study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. New Orleans, for example, typically receives between 15% and 20% of its 63 inches of annual rainfall from tropical systems. But individual storms often unload much more than a few inches of rain – some of the most prolific have dumped feet of it, something becoming increasingly common as climate change supercharges rainfall in hurricanes. And that’s a big deal with a potentially more active hurricane season and its increased chances for torrential, tropical rainfall on the horizon. Inland flooding surpassed storm surge as the deadliest threat from tropical systems, according to 2023 research from the National Hurricane Center. Driven by a budding La Niña and extremely warm ocean waters, the National Hurricane Center and many other forecasters are calling for a hyperactive season starting June 1 that could place the US coastline at risk of more tropical strikes. Drenching tropical systems could also arrive when they would do the most harm: early in the season. The region is often more vulnerable to flooding in the early part of hurricane season and that’s particularly the case this year, Keim explained. A named tropical storm or hurricane has formed in either May or early June in every hurricane season since 2015. Not every storm threatened land, but some like 2022’s Tropical Storm Alex did. This year’s exceptionally wet head start will likely extend the flood threat longer into hurricane season, unless summer heat ramps up quickly and bakes the moisture out of the ground. Last year, a dearth of tropical systems and surplus of heat domes suppressed rain and plunged parts of the South into the worst drought on record. There’s an 85% chance of an above average season and only a 5% chance the season will be below average, according to NOAA. A waning El Niño and the anticipation of a building La Niña this summer is one of the biggest indicators that the upcoming season will be very active. El Niño tends to create more hostile upper level winds that rip storms apart while La Niña does the opposite. Unlike last year, El Niño will not be around to curve many tropical cyclones away from the US, potentially leaving the coasts vulnerable this season. Extreme, record-breaking ocean heat is another major factor an average season could be out of reach. Warm water acts like food for storms, helping them to form, strengthen and survive. Off-the-charts ocean heat last year not only created more storms in the Atlantic by neutralizing the storm-dampening effects of El Niño, but also fueled explosive strengthening – called rapid intensification – of the storms that formed across the globe. Rapid intensification is becoming more likely as the atmosphere and oceans warm in a changing climate. And the Atlantic Ocean is still record warm, both at and below the surface."

",Opinion by Noah Berlatsky,"Editor’s Note: Noah Berlatsky is a freelance writer in Chicago. The views expressed here are solely the author’s. View more opinion articles on CNN. Ecological apocalypse is a common theme of many Hollywood films, which specialize in visions of future devastation — the decapitated Statue of Liberty in “Planet of the Apes” (1968), the emptied planet’s surface in “12 Monkeys” (1995) and even the invasion of flying killer fish in the “Sharknado” franchise. Yet despite the imaginative fascination of movie-makers and movie audiences, the public sense of urgency about global warming remains limited, and government action over the decades has been sporadic at best. If we’re all worried about ecological destruction, why aren’t we moving more quickly towards ecological solutions? There’s no one answer to this complicated question. However, George Miller’s “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015) and its new prequel, “Furiosa,” provide some possible explanations. (The distributor for “Furiosa” and CNN share a parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) These films connect ecological devastation to patriarchy and hierarchy; the collapse of global ecosystems and the scarcity of resources are inseparable from violent (and gendered) exploitation. Dealing with climate catastrophe requires a fundamental challenge to the systems that have created the climate catastrophe in the first place: something that Hollywood, and people outside Hollywood, have trouble imagining or embracing. Like all the Mad Max films going back to the 1979 original, “Fury Road” and “Furiosa” are set in post-apocalyptic wastelands following some indeterminate eco-catastrophe. Food is scarce, water scarcer and civilization has disintegrated into warring gangs. “Fury Road” and “Furiosa” focus on a citadel ruled by tyrannical, bloodthirsty and toothy-masked Immortan Joe (played in “Fury Road” by Hugh Keays-Byrne and in “Furiosa” by Lachy Hulme). Joe controls a water supply pumped from an underground aquifer; women serve as his wives and bear him children, or else are hitched to giant milking machines. Male children become war boys — fanatic fighters convinced that they’ll go to heaven if they die in battle for Joe. Joe keeps most of the population subjugated: They’re thin, dirty and wait desperately for a sip of life-giving water. The control of natural resources gives Joe control of women’s reproduction and of male violence — or vice versa. Either way, or both ways, Joe’s rule depends on mechanics of exploitation and hierarchy. Patriarchal power is built on treating both people and the environment as things — to be expropriated for the greater glory of Joe. A better world requires not just a better use of resources, but a different relationship to resources and each other. In both Furiosa films, such a society emerges in the Green Place, the home from which Furiosa (played in “Fury Road” by Charlize Theron and in “Furiosa” by Anya Taylor-Joy) was stolen as a child. We only get glimpses of the Green Place, but it appears to be ruled collaboratively by women, and resources are shared, conserved and allocated to all. Again, many Hollywood films address climate crisis. Yet calls for sweeping political change often sit uneasily within genre conventions and corporate moviemaking. There are some exceptions — such as the acerbic “Don’t Look Up” (2022). But in general, creators have largely tried to avoid the insight that “Furiosa” makes plain — to solve the climate crisis, we need to resolve a crisis of political exploitation and inequity. One common narrative choice is to make the most fervent environmentalists the bad guys. Supervillains such as Thanos of “Infinity War” (2018) and Orm of “Aquaman” (2018) understand that the political status quo has to change in order to protect the earth’s resources and oceans. But their preferred response is genocide and/or dictatorship. We’re asked to view the superheroes (be they Avengers or Aquaman) the way the war boys view Immortan Joe; they’re the embodiment of good and of the law, and to overthrow them is to sow chaos and evil. In both films, heroes focus on defeating the threat to the status quo, and the climate dangers raised by the villains get largely shunted aside and forgotten in the roar of the plot and the blare of CGI. Another typical Hollywood approach is to suggest that we can trust the powerful to enact change with enough time and faith. That’s the message in “The Day After Tomorrow” (2004), an early global warming apocalypse story, where a Dick Cheney-esque figure at first pooh-poohs the dangers of global apocalypse. But as things get worse, the Cheney analog understands the error of his ways, and becomes the kinder, more environmentally conscious Immortan Joe we need. In line with “The Day After Tomorrow,” a lot of disaster movies focus on standard heroes committed to conventional verities like courage and family, as they battle the apocalypse and defeat it through predictable heroics. In such narratives, there’s limited or nonexistent discussion of the possibility for necessary political or social change. In “A Quiet Place” (2018) or “Underwater” (2020) or “Moonfall” (2022), climate or environmental apocalypse merges with monster movie. The goal in such films is generally to defeat outside invaders rather than to rethink how society works. “Furiosa” too, arguably, shies away from some of the insights about power, climate and apocalypse that define “Fury Road.” Immortan Joe is not really the villain of the piece; that role goes to another warlord, Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). It’s Dementus who kidnaps Furiosa as a child, and its Dementus who is the focus of her wrath and her revenge narrative. With Joe and Dementus at odds, Furiosa ends up on Joe’s side. Joe’s stable, responsible repression is at least more predictable than Dementus’ erratic, pointless brutality. If you’re going to be ruled by a violent patriarch, better to pick the one that delivers water on schedule, even if the rest of the world goes to hell. In the latest film, Furiosa is plunged into such horror and trauma that she can’t focus on anything but her own survival and rage. Under constant assault, it’s difficult to imagine a better world. The worse world, in fact, can seem like the only available security. “Fury Road” and “Furiosa” can be seen together as Furiosa struggles to stop perceiving the Green Place as an ideal past, and to start thinking about how to change the current world so it becomes sustainable and just. That’s a difficult fight, though. When the status quo feels like one rolling disaster, it’s easy to imagine various disasters getting worse. It’s harder to imagine how to change the world to make things better — especially when many people with money to do things like fund movies don’t want things to change too much. Immortan Joe likes the world the way it is, climate crisis and all. “Furiosa” both points towards a different road and shows us how hard that road is not just to travel, but to see."

What will it take to keep the lights on as America’s grid gets thrashed?,05-31-2024,"                                                 Picture this: It’s a Thursday night in Houston and thunderstorms are rolling in.

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Picture this: It’s a Thursday night in Houston and thunderstorms are rolling in. Suddenly, winds roar past 100 mph. Trees snap, windows shatter and the city darkens as power flickers out. Even after it’s over, it takes days for the lights to come back on in parts of the city. A week and a half later, the Tuesday morning commute is just getting underway in Dallas. Thunderstorms rush through the city, unleashing hurricane-strength wind gusts and torrential rain. Trees and power lines topple to the ground, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people. Many homes and businesses remain without power days later. That’s exactly the scenario that played out in Texas over the past few weeks, and these kinds of outages are happening more frequently as destructive extreme weather thrashes the aging electric grid. From 2000 to 2023, 80% of all major US power outages were due to weather, according to analysis by Climate Central, a non-profit research group. The number of weather-related outages from 2014 to 2023 doubled compared to outages at the start of the century. Being without power is not only expensive – keeping people out of work and school, and keeping businesses closed – it’s dangerous. There doesn’t need to be a heat wave in Texas for summertime temperatures to soar to unhealthy levels. Heat is particularly dangerous without A/C at night, which is when the body needs to cool itself after a hot day. Experts say there could be ways to keep the lights on in the face of extreme conditions, even if there’s no single perfect solution. Power generation, transmission and distribution within the US happens on a power grid, an interconnected series of power plants, power lines and electrical substations. But the grid’s infrastructure is aging fast and struggling to keep up with modern power demands, according to the US Department of Energy. It’s also struggling as extreme weather gets more intense as the planet warms. “Our (power) infrastructure was built for the weather of the past,” Michael Webber, a professor of engineering at the University of Texas said. “It wasn’t built for the weather of the future, and the weather of the future is already here.” A majority of the US electric grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, but some of the first parts of the system were constructed in the early 1900s. And 70% of transmission lines in the US are approaching the end of their 50- to 80-year lifecycles, according to the DOE. Every element within the power grid is vulnerable in some way to extreme weather, Webber told CNN. Power is largely distributed by above-ground power lines from large transmission towers to smaller – and abundant – power poles. Most outages happen because of failures with power lines and poles, making them a “big weakness” in the overall system, according to Webber. Severe weather – defined as thunderstorms, high winds, heavy rain and tornadoes – was far and away the main cause of weather-related major outages at 58%, according to Climate Central. And it directly impacts these exposed lines. Power lines and poles can be brought down by falling tree limbs, topple over in fierce winds and be snapped by heavy ice. Extreme events, like the derecho and tornado that tore through the Houston in mid-May, can turn massive transmission towers into mangled metal. Hurricanes, like 2021’s Ida, inflict damage at a colossal scale. When infrastructure can’t withstand extreme weather, it not only disrupts power, it also creates its own disasters: The massive Smokehouse Creek Fire ignited earlier this year after a “decayed” power pole toppled in strong winds, according to a report from the Texas House of Representatives. But it’s not just power lines and power poles under attack from extreme weather; the things that generate power can also take a beating. Blasts of frigid cold can freeze necessary equipment, leaving it unable to keep up with demand. Historic cold shuttered power plants and froze non-winterized wind turbines in Texas in 2021. The resulting power outages were vast and deadly in the brutal cold. Meanwhile, searing heat sends electricity demands skyrocketing as cooling needs surge. If power needs cannot be met, blackouts and brownouts arise. Equipment also overheats and fails if temperatures soar too high. In order to keep power flowing during extreme weather, or restore it quickly in the aftermath, the US grid needs to be upgraded and fortified on a vast scale. It will cost trillions of dollars to do this well, according to Webber. Power poles, power lines and transmission equipment need to be built or rebuilt stronger and operate at a higher capacity to keep larger amounts of power flowing, even when demand spikes. At the most basic level, a wooden power pole is less durable and has a shorter lifespan than a metal pole. Installing sturdy, metal poles means more stay upright in extreme weather, but they could come at an environmental cost, given how energy intensive it is to make steel. Fortified power lines above ground will still sometimes be knocked over by violent storms, so another solution is to put power lines underground. Parts of the US are already doing this, including cities like Anaheim, California, and Fort Collins, Colorado. But burying electricity isn’t perfect solution, either. Running power lines underground is often 10 times more expensive than building overhead wires, and the lines are susceptible to flooding and can be difficult for crews to service, according to Rob Gramlich, founder and president of Grid Strategies, a power grid consulting firm. Modernization of outdated power lines costs around $100,000 per mile, while new power lines can run anywhere from $1 million to $10 million per mile depending on geography and whether they are above or underground, according to Webber. But it’s an investment that will pay for itself when fewer power lines spark devastating wildfires or outages that cost up to billions of dollars are avoided, Webber contends. A stronger grid also has to have smarter controls to rapidly reroute power where it’s needed when outages do occur. “Any number of things can happen to power generation in any one area,” Gramlich told CNN. “But if you have fortified inter-regional transmission, you have an insurance policy against many risks.” The US is designed so that if power needs in one region spike because of increased demand or power generation fails, another region steps in to help handle the load. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind make the grid more resilient by diversifying the number of ways power is generated if another method fails. But, the energy generated by renewable means is still delivered via the same vulnerable infrastructure as all other power. It may be an insurmountable task to eliminate weather-related power outages completely, but it should be possible to eradicate major, multi-day outages. “Ultimately, I think it really should be extremely rare to have a multi-day power outage,” Gramlich said. “We can plan the whole electricity system so that never happens.”"

","Esha Mitra, CNN","There’s no fresh water in the slums of Delhi’s Chanakyapuri neighborhood. It’s 49.9 degrees Celsius, or 121 Fahrenheit – the hottest temperature on record. The sun belts off the tin roofs of the shanties. Desperate people wait for drinking water to be delivered. When it arrives, there’s chaos. Dozens of people run to the truck, some even climbing on top of it to throw pipes in, pushing in to get their containers filled with water. It’s first come first served, and many people miss out. Mother-of-six Poonam Shah is one of those people. “There are 10 people in my family – six kids, me and my husband, my in-laws, relatives come over sometimes – can we all bathe in one bucket of water?” she asks. Today her family may not even have one bucket. Poonam was working her street food stall when the water truck arrived. She tried to run back for it – but it was too late, the water had run out. “What are we supposed to do? There’s no water. I work in a shop, there’s no water there. But forget about the shop, we don’t have water for our kids.” She’ll now look to buy water – it’ll cost up to half of the $3 she usually earns in a day selling samosas and other snacks. As record heat grips northern India, the Delhi government has been forced to ration these free water deliveries. Previously, Poonam’s neighborhood received two to three tanker deliveries per day. Now it’s just the one. Temperatures in Delhi have been hovering above 40 degrees Celsius over the last week and on Tuesday they hit an all-time high of 49.9 degrees Celsius in one area of the capital, according to the Indian Meteorological Department. At least one death has been reported in the city so far, and dozens more across the country. At Ram Manohar Lohiya (RML) hospital in Delhi, a heatstroke unit with cold immersion tanks is treating more and more patients suffering extreme heatstroke, exhaustion and dehydration. The hospital’s ice baths and air conditioning can help a handful of the millions of people who have no choice but to brave the Delhi heat to earn a living, but only if they get to hospital quickly. “The mortality rate of heatstroke is very, very high, it is close to 60% to 80%,” Dr Ajay Shukla, medical superintendent of the hospital, told CNN. “People can survive if they get immediate and very early medical care and that involves rapidly cooling the body.” “If people get that rapid cooling, they stabilize, they survive. But if they get to the hospital late and the intervention is late, the mortality rate is so high. We’re unable to save them if they come to us late.” The patient who died in Delhi had been admitted to RML hospital. He was a 40-year-old migrant laborer, and like many working outdoors in the harsh sun, he succumbed to the heat. “He was working in a factory… he was working in an area where there was no cooling, a very small congested area with a tin shed so there were multiple workers inside,” Dr Shukla said, adding that it was too late by the time he arrived at the hospital. The man’s name has not been released, for privacy reasons. Most of the hospital’s heatstroke patients are from poorer communities, where working people have no choice but to spend long stretches out in the summer sun. Kali Prasad sells water and lemon juice outside the India Gate. Each day he pushes his water cart to the famed spot, from his home some eight kilometers (five miles) away. “The heat has risen drastically over the last five to 10 days, it’s very hot, people aren’t even coming here because of it,” he said. He says he has no choice but to stand all day under the scorching sun, as there is no one else to provide for his wife, children and parents. In recent years, the summer heat has come earlier, temperatures have risen higher and higher, and heatwaves have lengthened. Northwest and central India have been experiencing maximum temperatures above 42 degrees Celsius with some towns even crossing the 50-degree mark, according to the Indian Meteorological Department. The trend is “a clear manifestation of the escalating impacts of climate change,” says Farwa Aamer, the director of South Asia initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “This alarming spike in temperatures underscores the urgent need for robust adaptation strategies and proactive measures in India and the region to protect lives and livelihoods, especially among vulnerable populations, from the devastating health effects of such intense heat,” said Aamer, who researches climate vulnerabilities in South Asia. For many in Delhi, the climate crisis has already made life during summer unbearable. “We have to deal so we deal, we are poor people so we have to die, we have to work no matter how hot it is,” Kali Prasad said. “We don’t have any other option.”"

The warnings are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service and are used when widespread, dangerous heat is expected. The soaring temperatures are being caused by a heat dome, a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks. The resulting heat becomes more intense the longer a heat dome lasts. TELL US: Worried about affording air conditioning this summer? Share your story Dangerous heat will get underway Tuesday afternoon in parts of California and expand its reach into more of the Southwest by Wednesday and as a heat dome parks over the West. It will then reach the Pacific Northwest by late-week. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week. Temperatures will soar into the upper 90s and low 100s Tuesday in California’s Central Valley – including where the Corral Fire is burning near Tracy. Sacramento is forecast to hit triple digits Tuesday for the first time this year. California’s capital typically hits this threshold in early June, but last year it didn’t happen until the end of the month. Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in the Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California’s desert regions. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, is likely to reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees by Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn’t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. The Southwest will start to bake by Wednesday as temperatures in parts of southern Arizona and far southern Nevada approach 110 degrees. Phoenix will likely have hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday even though the city doesn’t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, more than three weeks earlier than the city typically exceeds this threshold. The early summerlike heat will threaten daily high temperature records across a significant portion of the West this week. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day’s high temperature record could fall. By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east. Fire danger will also rise while the heat is at its peak. Sizzling temperatures and low levels of humidity will dry out short-fuse fuels such as grasses and brush, making them more prone to burn. Breezy winds will develop at times, especially in California into midweek. The combination of these factors will make it easier for fires to ignite and spread. The Corral Fire has consumed more than 14,000 acres of land in California’s San Joaquin county since it ignited south of Tracy Saturday afternoon. Residents were ordered to evacuate over the weekend as the fire – initially fueled by gusty winds and dry, hot conditions – threatened communities. Firefighters gained an upper hand as winds eased Sunday and Monday and the blaze was 90% contained by Tuesday morning, according to CAL Fire. Evacuation warnings were lifted Monday evening as containment increased, according to CAL Fire. Officials urged residents to remain vigilant and be ready for potential changes to the fire risk level. Two Alameda County firefighters were injured while responding to the fire, Cal Fire Battalion Chief Josh Silveira told CNN early Sunday morning. They had minor to moderate injuries and were transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment, Silveira said. A section of I-580 was closed in both directions over the weekend as the fire’s thick smoke enveloped the roadway. All lanes were reopened Sunday night, according to the California Department of Transportation. The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to CAL Fire. Gusty winds up to 30 mph are possible Tuesday, which could complicate ongoing containment efforts. Temperatures will also surge well into the 90s from Tuesday through the weekend. An excessive heat warning is in effect for the region from Tuesday through Thursday. Note: The CNN Original Series “Violent Earth with Liev Schreiber” explores harrowing weather events such as wildfires that are increasingly frequent in our changing climate.

Unless planet-warming fossil fuel pollution is slashed, “this string of hottest months will be remembered as comparatively cold,” he said. Copernicus released its data the same day as United Nations Secretary General António Guterres made an impassioned speech in New York about climate change, slamming fossil fuel companies as the “godfathers of climate chaos” and, for the first time, explicitly calling on all countries to ban advertising their fossil fuel products. Guterres urged world leaders to swiftly take control of the spiraling climate crisis or face dangerous tipping points. “We are playing Russian roulette with our planet,” he said Wednesday. “We need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell.” As temperatures surge, global climate commitments are “hanging by a thread,” he warned. Copernicus’ data showed each month since July 2023 has been at least 1.5 degrees warmer than temperatures before industrialization, when humans started burning large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. The average global temperature over the past 12 months was 1.63 degrees above these pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Agreement in 2015, countries agreed to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. While this aim refers to warming over decades, rather than a single month or year, scientists say this breach is an alarming signal. “This is a harbinger of progressively more dangerous climate impacts close on the horizon,” said Richard Allan, a climate professor at the University of Reading in the UK. The news comes as the western US is experiencing its first heat wave so far this summer with temperatures soaring into the triple digits. But unprecedented heat has already left a trail of death and destruction across the planet this spring. Dozens have died in India over the past few weeks as temperatures pushed toward 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit); brutal temperatures in Southeast Asia have caused deaths, school closures and shriveled crops; and as heat surged in Mexico, howler monkeys dropped dead from trees. Hotter air and oceans also fuel heavier rainfall and destructive storms like those that have battered the United States, Brazil, Kenya and the United Arab Emirates, among other nations, this year. The recent heat offers “a window into the future with extreme heat that challenges the limits of human survivability,” said Ben Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute. “It is vital people understand that every tenth of a degree of warming exposes more people to dangerous and potentially deadly heat,” he told CNN. “Extreme events turbocharged by climate chaos are piling up, destroying lives, pummeling economies and hammering health,” Gutteres said. Humanity is having an outsized impact on the world, he said, likening it to the meteor that began the process of wiping out dinosaurs 66 million years ago. “In the case of climate, we are not the dinosaurs,” Guterres said. “We are the meteor. We are not only in danger. We are the danger.” Global temperatures are expected to start dropping below record-breaking levels in the next few months as El Niño — a natural climate phenomenon that tends to boost the planet’s average temperature — weakens. But that won’t mean an end to the long-term trend of rising temperatures as humans continue to burn planet-heating fossil fuels. “While this sequence of record-breaking months will eventually be interrupted, the overall signature of climate change remains and there is no sign in sight of a change in such a trend,” Buontempo said. Guterres’ speech also referenced new data released by the World Meteorological Organization, which found a nearly 86% chance that at least one of the years between 2024 and 2028 will break the hottest-year record, set in 2023. The WMO also calculated a nearly 50% chance that global average temperatures over the entire five-year period between 2024 and 2028 would be more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. That would bring the world closer to breaching the longer-term 1.5-degree limit at the heart of the Paris Agreement. Guterres laid blame for the climate crisis firmly at the doorstep of fossil fuel companies that “rake in record profits and feast off trillions in taxpayer-funded subsidies,” he said. These companies have spent billions of dollars over decades “distorting the truth, deceiving the public and sowing doubt,” he added. He called on every country to ban fossil fuel ads, similar to advertising bans implemented around the world for other products that harm human health, such as tobacco. “We are at a moment of truth,” he said, adding that the battle for a liveable planet would be won or lost in this decade. He called on world leaders to take immediate action, including huge cuts in planet-heating pollution and an immediate end to any new coal projects. He pushed rich countries to commit to quitting coal by 2030, reducing oil and gas by 60% by 2035 and increasing the flow of funding to the poorest, most climate-vulnerable nations. “We cannot accept a future where the rich are protected in air-conditioned bubbles, while the rest of humanity is lashed by lethal weather in unliveable lands,” Guterres said."

",Opinion by Pamela Appea,"Editor’s Note: Pamela Appea is a New York City-based journalist covering health, science and intersectionality. The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN Asthma cut short the life of my mother and has sickened each of my two children at various points in their lives. During one relatively brief episode of my life I fell ill from it too, some years back. I’m better now but am left with the dread that asthma can always recur, upending the life of my family, sending us running to middle of the night visits to the emergency room or causing my kids to miss yet another day of school. I worry about asthma in the winter when the frigid, dry air can lead to narrowed, irritated airways making the intake of each breath labored. I worry about it in spring, when the pollen in the air can trigger wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. I worry about it in the autumn as my lungs are not quite used to the increasing cold and when ragweed pollen fills the air. But these days, my fears about asthma are centered mostly around the summer months. Last year, billows of thick black smoke cascaded from Canada’s raging wildfires, blackening the skies of the northern plains of the US and polluting the air as far away as New York City, where I live. Those blankets of smog settled over much of the US and descended on communities as far away as Florida. Some of the smoke even found its way to Europe. My family weathered the worst of the smog indoors and luckily none of us fell ill. Now we may be on the cusp of experiencing a repeat of last summer — and families like mine with a history of asthma are bracing ourselves again. Stultifying heat and devastating wildfires are back in Canada. Last month, fires across the border in Canada led to evacuations of hundreds of people. Minnesota and Wisconsin last month issued warnings that people should stay inside. That was in mid-May, when it was still springtime. I shudder to think what August will bring. Research has shown that wildfire smoke can be connected to the onset of asthma. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are some 25 million Americans with asthma, so I suspect that many, many others feel the same sense of dread that I do. There’s another connection between Canada, asthma and my family — and it’s a somewhat accidental one. My mother, an immigrant from Ghana, spent many years living in Canada, although she didn’t develop asthma until we moved to the United States. Her circuitous path is not unfamiliar for migrants to North America from Africa. After emigrating from Ghana, my mother spent a few years in England, and then moved to Quebec, where she lived and worked. Divorced, she was left to raise me, my older sister and two older brothers alone. She ultimately decided that New York City, with its rich immigrant community, including a good number of people from the African diaspora, was a better place to raise her family than the remote village in rural Canada where we were among the only Black people. But shortly after arriving in the United States, my mother developed adult-onset asthma. It could have been brought upon by stress, or environmental issues, genetics or a combination of factors, it’s impossible to say. At the time she began to fall ill more frequently, I was around 10. But even at that tender age, I quickly came to understand that asthma medications in the United States were prohibitively expensive. The high price tag meant that the medication my mother desperately needed was sometimes out of reach. After losing someone so close to me to asthma, I have become intimately familiar with the signs of the illness. My mom wouldn’t usually confess to me and my three older siblings that she was feeling poorly, but as a child, I learned to read her symptoms. I recall the helplessness I felt during her asthma attacks as her wheezing progressively worsened. I worried during the doctor’s appointments I sometimes accompanied her to, when she rattled off her list of ailments — tightness in her chest and not being able to take in a complete lungful of air. After her bouts of labored breathing, my mother would seem exhausted and depleted. I now understand that asthma episodes, particularly undertreated ones, can cause significant stress on the body. I wonder if damage caused by the cumulative effect of her asthmatic episodes is what cost her her life. Unfortunately, the challenges that my mom faced getting asthma medication persisted. Co-pays and uncovered prescription costs strained our family’s budget. There were times that my mother didn’t fill her prescriptions for her asthma medication out of concern over the cost. Then one night some three decades ago, her asthma struck again. It was a particularly serious episode that left my mother so short of breath that she was unable to utter more than a few words at a time. Before losing the ability to speak altogether that day, my mother asked me to call a family friend to take her to the hospital — she was worried, as always, about money and how the cost of an ambulance would further strain our family finances. By the time we finally arrived at the emergency room, she was unconscious. A short time later, she was gone. Asthma had claimed my mother at just 48 years old, in what should have been the prime of her life. Over the years with the signs and symptoms after years of living with asthma – first as the child of someone with the condition, then as the mother of two children who have developed severe asthma. I know that asthma has a genetic component. Research shows that if you have a parent with asthma, you have a 25% likelihood of developing asthma yourself. I think of my mother trying to stretch her medications.

Forecasters say it could get worse in summer.                                             ,"Ella Nilsen and Mary Gilbert, CNN","The United States has been rocked by an extraordinary number of tornadoes and devastating storms this year that have already left a staggering price tag. Now heading into what forecasters say will be an extreme summer – from punishing heat waves to severe weather and hurricanes – the nation’s disaster relief agency is expected to run out of money before it’s even over. The US has been thrashed with 11 extreme weather disasters with costs exceeding $1 billion so far this year, with a total price tag of $25.1 billion, according to an updated tally from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tied for the second-most such disasters on record and doesn’t even include the extreme weather in the second half of May, said Adam Smith, an applied climatologist with NOAA. That is worrying news for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose major disaster relief fund could slip into the red by the end of summer – a more than $1.3 billion shortfall in August, according to a May report. Florida’s two Republican senators recently wrote a letter to FEMA asking the agency how much more money it would need to respond to hurricane season. In a statement to CNN, a FEMA spokesperson didn’t address exactly how much funding it would need to get through hurricane season, but said the agency is continuing to work with Congress “to ensure sufficient funding is available﻿.” “Without additional funding, FEMA will take steps prior to funding exhaustion to ensure resources are available to support ongoing lifesaving and life sustaining activities,” the spokesperson said. In the event of a major catastrophe like a hurricane, the agency would have a funding reserve set aside for initial response and recovery operations. FEMA’s tenuous balance sheet reflects how many destructive storms have already lashed the US. This spring produced the second-most tornadoes to-date since records began in 1950, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Tornado activity skyrocketed from late April through May, with more than 780 confirmed tornadoes cutting across the central and eastern US during April and May, the SPC said. Some storms have been deadly. An EF4 that ripped through Greenfield, Iowa, killed five. Another tornado in Cooke County, Texas, later in the month killed seven people. Severe thunderstorms have been extremely destructive, with hail wreaking havoc across the central US. Severe thunderstorms blasted multiple cities with hurricane-force wind gusts in May. A derecho with 100 mph wind turned debris into projectiles and shattered glass windows in downtown Houston skyscrapers. Nearly a million homes and businesses were left without power, many for days, after violent winds mangled massive electrical transmission towers. And scientists are warning this summer could continue the destruction as the dramatic warming of the planet and oceans from burning fossil fuels set the stage for a supercharged hurricane season and dangerous heat. Summer historically is the season with the most billion-dollar disasters because it is “a transition period of many extremes historically, as the severe storm season continues while the prospect of hurricane season approaches,” Smith said. A chorus of expert voices are calling for an above-average Atlantic hurricane season as anxiety-inducing conditions in the atmosphere and oceans align. Record-breaking ocean heat is expected to feed hurricanes, helping them form, strengthen and survive. El Niño is predicted to give way to La Niña and create more favorable atmospheric conditions for storms to thrive. Just about every kind of extreme weather is possible during summer, including more severe thunderstorms. June is the third-most active month for tornadoes in the US, according to the SPC. It’s also the most-active month for destructive and costly severe hail, a 2012 study found. While the connection between hurricanes and climate change is strong, scientists are less sure whether there’s a link to stronger or more frequent tornadoes but are sure it is making heat waves more intense and frequent. Above-average temperatures are expected over nearly every square mile of the Lower 48 this summer, and it began early: It’s already been the hottest start to June on record in Las Vegas, as the West gets hit with a series of early-season heat waves. Prolonged, intense heat dries out soil and can lead to drought and billions of dollars in costs due to crop losses. Last year, a series of heat domes seared the South and produced the worst drought on record for Louisiana and one of the state’s worst fire seasons on record. Heat can dry out grass and create a tinderbox for fast-moving wildfires, particularly in the central and western US. California’s fire season could get a late start because of another exceptional wet season, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. But as heat takes its toll, wildfire activity could “really amp up” in California in late summer as the bounty of grass and brush from the wet season dries out, Swain said. He also highlighted the Great Basin in Nevada and Utah as a spot that normally doesn’t see wildfire but could, due to a “huge proliferation of grass.” According to Swain, wildfire activity could really kick off in late summer, and if that holds up, emergency response could stretch well into the fall. It’s shaping up to be another year of year-round extreme weather."

There are signs it’ll stick around for the long haul as a predicted hot summer kicks into gear. Parts of the West have been baking since a stifling heat dome set up over the region last week. One person died on Monday while hiking in Colorado National Monument Park in western Colorado, according to a news release from the National Park Service. Temperatures were around 90 degrees. Now, some of that heat and an additional push of hot air from Mexico are enveloping more of the US as the jet stream – a river of fast-moving air in the upper atmosphere that separates warm air from cold air – slowly shifts north over the central and eastern states. Heat will ramp up Thursday from the Plains to the East Coast, marking a considerable change from seasonably cool conditions earlier in the week. Highs in the upper 80s and 90s will be common from the Plains and Midwest to the Southeast, Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic. Several cities will experience the warmest day of the year so far Thursday, but temperatures will be short of record levels. Humidity will build alongside the heat and make conditions feel even more uncomfortable. The thermometer has yet to climb out of the low 90s in St. Louis this year, but that will change Thursday with a high around 96 degrees. The heat index – how air feels to the human body – could approach triple digits. Temperatures will warm even more Friday for much of the Gulf Coast, Southeast and mid-Atlantic as hot air surges north. Highs well into the 90s will stretch from Texas through Georgia and the Carolinas north into parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Friday will be the hottest day of the year so far in Washington, DC. The high temperature could approach the mid-90s, which is about 10 degrees higher than normal. Heat will be at its worst by Saturday for much of the Gulf Coast and Southeast but ease slightly for areas farther north with the passage of a cold front. Atlanta is expected to top out near 99 degrees on Saturday, which would be a temperature record for the date and the hottest reading of the year so far. If the city were to hit 100 degrees it would be the first triple-digit temperature there since August 2019. Highs in the upper 90s and low 100s could also break Saturday’s high temperature records in multiple other Southeast cities including: Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Expansive heat will build once again for much of the central and eastern US on Sunday as the jet stream settles near the US-Canada border and high pressure builds in the upper atmosphere. Anyone hoping for relief is out of luck. A long-lasting heat dome will build early next week in the East and send temperatures soaring even higher."

That doesn’t mean it won’t face challenges.                                             ,"Analysis by Krystal Hur, CNN","A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. The global econ﻿omy is finally on track to stabilize. That doesn’t mean it won’t face challenges. The World Bank on Tuesday raised its 2024 outlook for global economic growth to hold steady at 2.6%, an increase from its previous projection of 2.4% growth. But the group warned that growth won’t be felt evenly or match the clip seen before the Covid pandemic. “Four years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,” Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist, said in a release accompanying the report. “However, growth is at lower levels than before 2020. Prospects for the world’s poorest economies are even more worrisome.” Here are three risks the World Bank sees. High interest rates. The group expects global inflation to slow to 3.5% this year and 2.9% in 2025 but fall at a more sluggish pace than it expected six months ago. World interest rates will likely average 4% over 2025 and 2026, roughly double the average of the two decades preceding the pandemic, according to the World Bank. The European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have already cut their key interest rates in recent weeks. The US Federal Reserve has yet to follow, holding rates steady for a seventh consecutive time on Wednesday. The Fed also trimmed its projections for rate cuts this year from three to one. Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the progress made on tamping down prices but said that the central bank needs to see inflation closer to its 2% target before easing monetary policy. “An environment of ‘higher-for-longer’ rates would mean tighter global financial conditions and much weaker growth in developing economies,” said Ayhan Kose, the World Bank’s deputy chief economist, in a release. Geopolitical tensions. The World Bank said that spillover risk from the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Hamas war could curb global growth by pushing up oil prices and shipping costs. Oil prices have come down since initial spikes from both wars, with the price of international crude futures settling at $82.60 a barrel on Wednesday. Attacks on container vessels in the Red Sea on one of the world’s most important trade routes have driven up costs and led to shipping delays. “Escalating conflict could also dent global business and consumer sentiment, and increase risk aversion, weighing on demand and growth,” the report said. Politics. Risks also stem from several possible changes to government leadership this year. Key elections have occurred or are set to take place in India, Mexico, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, among dozens of other countries. Trade tensions are already brewing between some of the world’s biggest global economic engines. China said last month that it staunchly opposes new US tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles and other products, warning that the trade barriers would affect the wider relationship between the two economic superpowers. Then, the European Commission on Wednesday said that the EU is hiking tariffs on EVs imported from China, drawing blowback from Beijing. “Heightened trade policy-related uncertainty and the potential for more inward-looking policies could weigh on trade prospects and economic activity,” the World Bank report said. Grocery prices stayed flat in May, after ticking down the month before. But menu prices, a source of frustration for budget-conscious consumers, are still going up — even as restaurants brag about their discounted meals, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner. Menu prices rose 0.4% at sit-down restaurants from April to May, adjusted for seasonal swings, according to inflation data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that time prices ticked up 0.2% at limited service spots, which include fast casual and fast food joints. The difference between grocery increases and menu price inflation was more pronounced for the full year. Grocery prices rose 1% in the 12 months through May. In that period, menu prices at full-service, or sit-down, restaurants rose 3.5%. They jumped 4.5% at limited-service restaurants, which include fast food and fast casual joints. The increases, particularly in fast food prices, have caused customers to pull back on spending and complain online, eroding the sector’s reputation for affordability. Restaurant chains raise menu prices every year, but since the pandemic hikes have been coming in fast and furious. Executives noted that for a while, the higher prices didn’t scare people off. But customers finally snapped, leaving chains to reverse course and sometimes get defensive. McDonald’s USA president Joe Erlinger recently said in an open letter that prices have risen about 21% over five years. That’s a bit less than inflation overall — not 100% as, he said, people may think, thanks to an analysis from FinanceBuzz. It recently found that McDonald’s prices have risen 100% since 2014. Still, he acknowledged that at some locations, Big Mac meals may be going for much higher. On TikTok, complaints of $3 McDonald’s hash browns and $16 meals have gone viral. Read more here. TikTok may not be as hot a place for politics as many seem to think. The attention devoted to TikTok as a powerful force in US politics — for better or for worse — does not seem to match up with the experience of most TikTok users, according to new survey data released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. As the short-form video app has surged to 170 million US users, politicians have flocked to TikTok in hopes of wooing young voters. Former President Donald Trump joined TikTok last week, amassing 6 million followers in a matter of days. President Joe Biden’s campaign launched on TikTok in February and has posted more than 200 videos — though the campaign’s following is just a fraction of Trump’s at 373,000. Other politicians, meanwhile, warn that TikTok’s links to China through its parent company mean the Chinese government could theoretically try to influence US politics on a massive scale, if it ever accessed the personal data of TikTok users. (TikTok denies it has ever given the Chinese government US user data and is suing to block a law Biden signed this spring that could ban the app from the United States.) But the picture painted by Pew’s latest surveys suggests politics is still just a small part of what the platform has to offer. Read more here."

Here’s what to expect in the coming months,06-13-2024,                                                 El Niño has officially come to an end and the ripples from its demise will shake up weather around the globe.                                             ,"Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","El Niño has officially come to an end and the ripples from its demise will shake up weather around the globe. El Niño – a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean – has gripped the planet since the start of last summer. It reached super status earlier this year after boosting temperatures during the hottest year on record and influencing other global weather events. With El Niño out of the spotlight, its opposite is preparing to take center stage later this summer: La Niña. For now, neither La Niña nor El Niño are present and a so-called neutral phase has begun, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. But this will change quickly as La Niña builds through the summer and is likely firmly in control by September during the peak of hurricane season. Here’s what a summer without El Niño and a budding La Niña could have in store. La Niña summers following strong El Niño winters have historically been some of the hottest on record in the US. This summer could be no different, even before La Niña is entrenched. Above-average temperatures are expected over nearly all of the Lower 48 this summer. Sizzling conditions began early in the West and a push of July-like heat is spreading over the eastern half of the country. The transition to La Niña isn’t the only factor influencing temperatures during the hottest time of the year. They are always on the rise in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Along with more intense heat, seasonal forecasts show a concerning precipitation trend for a large portion of the western half of the US. Drier than normal conditions are expected for most West states and parts of the Plains. Dryness and heat are cyclical. The hotter an area becomes, the more it dries out, which could be a recipe for new or worsening drought. A dry area will then get even hotter as most of the sun’s energy goes into heating the ground, with little energy lost to evaporation of wet soil. The loss of El Niño will also have major ramifications in the Atlantic Ocean and is one major reason experts are calling for a hyperactive hurricane season. El Niño tends to create hostile upper level winds that rip storms apart while La Niña does the opposite. So, more storms could develop this year without El Niño holding them back. El Niño also won’t be around to curve many storms away from the US, potentially leaving the coasts vulnerable this season. The Atlantic Ocean’s record-breaking water temperatures could also act like food for storms, helping them to form, strengthen and survive. The Atlantic is also not the only ocean that’s steamy. Over the past year, El Niño helped drive global average ocean temperatures to record-breaking levels. La Niña may eventually have somewhat of a cooling effect on the world’s oceans, potentially leveling off some of the out-of-control heating of the past year. But that’s not happening anytime soon. Oceans are incredibly slow to cool, especially since about 90% of the world’s excess heat produced by burning planet-heating fossil fuels are stored in them. El Niño arrived in June of 2023 and eventually became one of the strongest on record. It influenced the world during its year-long lifetime. Most notably, El Niño helped push both air and ocean temperatures to record levels globally. Every month from June 2023 to May 2024 was the world’s hottest such month on record, CNN previously reported. Global ocean temperatures first climbed to record breaking levels in March 2023 and have remained at historic levels since then. Despite records starting before El Niño arrived on the scene, the toasty climate pattern only exacerbated the situation as record heat in the air seeped into the oceans. The natural climate pattern also influenced many significant weather events since last summer. El Niño likely had a hand in hot and dry conditions in northern South America that brought the Amazon River to record-low levels in October, the US Lower 48’s hottest ever winter and severe drought in large portions of central and southern Africa this winter. Parts of Africa’s east coast typically record more rain during El Niño events, but excessive rainfall unfolded to devastating, deadly effect in Kenya in April and May. California and the western US also typically pick up more rain during El Niño, especially over the winter months. That played out this past winter when multiple powerful atmospheric river events slammed the West Coast. Further research is needed to determine El Niño’s full impact over the last 12 months, but these events are proof of the highly influential pattern’s reach. CNN’s Laura Paddison contributed to this report."

The city of Fenyang in the northern province of Shanxi registered its highest temperature ever recorded at 40.2 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). China had its hottest spring on record this year. The national average temperature between March and May reached 12.3 degrees Celsius, the highest since records began in 1961, with 12 national meteorological stations registering temperatures reaching or surpassing records, according to the National Climate Center. Last year was the country’s hottest year on record. Meanwhile, southern parts of the country, the top rice growing region, have been grappling with weeks of downpours. In April, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement that rainfall in parts of the region had risen by 50% to 80%, and had even doubled in some areas. It made a series of recommendations on reducing damage to growing “early rice” saplings, which are planted in March and harvested in June. The CMA said on Thursday that heavy rainfall had occurred in the Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi and Guizhou regions — some of them major manufacturing and industrial centers. Hunan and Jiangxi are two of China’s biggest rice producers. China’s State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, a national coordination agency, issued an emergency response to both the flooding in the south and the drought in the north on Thursday, warning of a high risk of flash floods and geologic hazards. These rains appear to be related to a seasonal monsoon pattern that can lead to intense showers over short periods."

Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. This one will make temperatures skyrocket to levels hotter than even the hottest typical summer day. Hundreds of temperature records could fall by the end of next week, both during the day and at night. Temperatures will top out 15 to 20 degrees above normal over a huge portion of the eastern half of the country Monday afternoon, but surge even higher to reach 25 degrees above normal at times from Tuesday through Friday. This translates to days of high temperatures well into the 90s for tens of millions of people who don’t typically bake in long-lasting heat. Relief from the heat won’t be found at night, which is another symptom of a warming world. Overnight low temperatures aren’t expected to drop below the low 70s or upper 60s in many locations. To make matters worse, humidity will work in tandem with extreme heat to send the heat index – how heat feels to the human body – to dangerous triple digits in parts of the East. Heat index values in the low 100s are possible as far north as Maine next week. The health risks from heat will reach extreme levels for millions next week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and CDC. Heat is the deadliest form of weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. The Atlantic hurricane season looks ready to awaken at the same time intense summer heat bakes a significant portion of the country. There are two short-term risk areas that could produce the first tropical system of the year, and both are a little too close to the US coast for comfort. An area in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico has the highest chance to become the first tropical system. There is also a small window and a low chance the same stormy pattern driving Florida’s rain could develop into a tropical depression off the Southeast coast before it gets swept out to sea this weekend. Robust tropical moisture is swirling in the southwestern Gulf because of the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters. The gyre’s broad spin and abundant moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific Ocean when other necessary factors – including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water – align. That could be the case by midweek; the National Hurricane Center says there’s a medium chance a tropical depression could form in the Bay of Campeche in the southwestern Gulf. Most of the Gulf of Mexico is bathtub-warm, so if a tropical system manages to form it would have plenty of fuel to strengthen. If something does form, it’s likely to track north or northwest. Regardless of tropical development, a surge of moisture like the one behind the deluges in South Florida will provide much-needed wet weather to parts of Mexico that have been baking under extreme heat and brutal drought for weeks. But it will also raise the flood risk along the Gulf Coast, especially in areas soaked this spring. Multiple days of rain are heading for the Gulf Coast from Texas to Alabama starting Sunday and continuing throughout the week. Heat isn’t just making us sweat and giving hurricane season a boost – it’s also had a hand in several recent notable wildfires. Fire activity is increasing gradually nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Almost a dozen large fires are burning in parts of the West and half of these started in recent days. Hot, dry conditions in place since early in the month in the West will continue to increase wildfire risk and could worsen ongoing fires. Wildfire fuels like grass and plant life will continue to dry out during this time, making them more prone to fire ignition or spread. Winds will also kick up in the region later this weekend and early next week. Gusty winds cause wildfires to spread quickly, as the Corral Fire demonstrated in California at the start of June. Breezy conditions could also spell trouble next week for a small, but destructive fire in Arizona, about 70 miles northwest of Phoenix, dubbed the Rose Fire. The fire destroyed at least 15 structures – seven of which were homes – along with at least a dozen vehicles, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said Thursday. The fire had burned through at least 166 acres since igniting Wednesday, but was only 20% contained as of Thursday evening. CNN’s Paradise Afshar contributed to this report."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/14/world/catan-new-engeries-game-universe-cec/index.html,How the makers of a beloved board game reworked it to address the climate crisis,06-14-2024,                                                 Catan’s creators researched and incorporated climate science into gameplay. They’re hoping it will start deep moral and ethical discussions between players.                                             ,"Saira Mueller, CNN","For many people, games are an escape into a world of fun and fantasy. It may come as a surprise, then, that the newest edition of a popular board game deals directly with a timely issue that’s not quite so fun: the climate crisis. Catan, a game about collecting and using resources such as bricks and lumber to build and expand settlements in a fictional world, turns 30 next year. While the company has since released numerous versions and expansions — and sold more than 45 million copies worldwide — its latest edition, Catan: New Energies, is one of the biggest departures for the game so far. Instead of gameplay set in pre-industrial times, New Energies is set in the 21st century, with real elements such as power plants and pollution playing a major role. In many ways, it makes sense for a game about the rapid expansion of humanity to explore the effects of the climate crisis. After all, industrialization caused it. You may not expect a game about the climate crisis to be fun — or to be backed by deep research on the intricacies of the topic. But the developers of New Energies worked hard to balance joyful play with environmental science. And they’re not the first. In fact, climate change — or elements often related to it — is popping up in more games as the topic becomes increasingly prevalent in news reports and cultural conversations. The popular empire-building video game “Civilization 6” released an expansion titled Gathering Storm in 2019, which was almost wholly centered around climate. In Gathering Storm, players’ actions such as burning coal have major repercussions — rising sea levels and more frequent natural disasters such as tornadoes — which affect gameplay. “Terra Nil,” a popular world-building strategy game released in 2023, sees players transform a barren wasteland into an inviting paradise through the use of technology such as wind turbines and “toxin scrubbers.” This was the same year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report saying we had a very small window in which to “secure a livable and sustainable future for all.” “Climate change is an ever-growing problem … it makes sense that the most popular media in the world would also reflect these growing challenges,” Rachel Kowert, a research psychologist who specializes in games, tells CNN. This is, says Kowert, because “games reflect culture.” Adding climate crisis elements to games can also make the topic more accessible, Kowert says. “It adds that element of playfulness and fun. It makes it a social activity,” she says. “Not many people are going to sit down and read documents on climate change, but people love Catan.” In New Energies, the basic gameplay of gathering resources to build settlements is the same as in the traditional version of Catan. But in this version, there are additional cards, pieces and mechanics that introduce climate crisis elements. Instead of just building roads, towns and cities, players must build fossil fuel or renewable power plants to gather energy. But their choices carry consequences. If a player builds a fossil fuel power plant, for example, the level of greenhouse gasses in the game increases — indicated on the board itself with a little marker. When this happens, the potential for climate-related events in the game, such as flooding or air pollution, also increases. These climate events can block resource production for players and therefore their ability to expand their settlements and win the game. It can also trigger the early end of the game, in which case the player with the most renewable power plants wins. Players can add green discs to the bag — which can give players using renewable energy bonuses — by building renewable power plants. This also brings down the global carbon footprint on the tracker, so fewer discs need to be removed from the bag each turn. Adding climate elements into Catan certainly makes it more complicated to play. But this also reflects the reality of our world. Even experts struggle to reach a consensus on the best solutions to mitigate climate change. While Catan: New Energies was released on June 14 of this year, the game has actually been in development since 2011. It started with a scenario called Oil Springs based on managing oil resources, which was pitched to the Catan team by Erik Assadourian, a researcher at the Worldwatch Institute, a sustainability think tank. In the Oil Springs scenario, players could use oil to expand more rapidly — with the added potential to cause flooding of the Catan world. “At its heart, Catan is a growth story,” says Assadourian. “Without recognizing the limits to growth, that’s a problem.” The Oil Springs scenario, paired with WWF’s 2050 climate solutions report, inspired the idea of a Catan that deals with electricity as a resource, says Benjamin Teuber, game designer and Managing Director at Catan GmbH, who created New Energies with his late father, Catan creator Klaus Teuber, who died in April 2023. When development on New Energies started in 2011 there were three renewable energy sources: wind, water and solar. This, among other things, made it “very complicated,” says Teuber. Development of the game was shelved until the Covid-19 pandemic hit, when Benjamin Teuber and his father had more free time to revisit the idea. Immediately, solutions to the original gameplay problems started presenting themselves, Teuber says. To ensure the game’s climate science was still within the bounds of reality, Assadourian came on board as a consultant for New Energies toward the end of its development in 2022. He also wrote an almanac about climate at the back of the rulebook to build out the game’s thematic background. “You can only do so much when you’re constrained by the simplicity of game mechanics,” Assadourian tells CNN. In real life, “No renewable energy power plant is going to be a minus one pollution point.” Instead, Assadourian hopes the game will show people how we can transition from the current energy and economic system we’re in to a sustainable and regenerative one. The first step to that is reducing energy use. Even the physical materials for New Energies were chosen with the climate in mind. “When you’re creating a physical consumer product, it’s impossible to have no impact, but we focused on how we can lessen the environmental impact,” says Kelli Schmitz, the Director of Brand Development at Catan Studio. “The English printing of New Energies is printed and assembled in the United States using cardboard and wood from sustainable sources.” Before the design of New Energies wrapped in December 2022, outside playtesters were asked to provide feedback on the game. After all, it wouldn’t work if the game was too complex or not fun to play. “People liked it because nobody felt that we pushed our opinion on them,” says Teuber. “They were like, ‘Oh, I can actually grow quite well with fossil (fuels). Do I like this? I don’t know.’ “We wanted to really make this feel like a simulation, if you will, of reality. And for that reason, it’s important that you can win with fossil (fuel) energy. It would be bad, I think, if we just balanced it in a way that it’s impossible because then you give the wrong message — you don’t give the message of reality. The more real it feels, the more serious people will talk about it.” Many of the playtesters had to question their morality and make decisions based on it, says Teuber. “They said, ‘It’s fascinating, because I really wasn’t sure what to do. I had this moral thing, but I wanted to win the game.’” In real life, almost everyone has an opinion on what we could do as a society to reduce the effects of the climate crisis. But few of us are in a position to make changes on a global scale. Having the power to improve the health of the planet, even in a board game, can be empowering. “The fun thing about games is there’s enough detachment that you can engage with this big, scary concept in this big, varied space,” says Kowert, the research psychologist. “And then maybe at the end of it, come out with a greater understanding of what you can actually do, what power you have.” If players come away from New Energies having philosophical discussions about our climate and trying to make little changes in their lives, the game will have done its job, says Teuber. “The game itself won’t change the world, but it maybe enables you a little bit in thinking, ‘Oh, I maybe have more power to make things change.’”"

Republicans.,06-16-2024,"                                                 When President Joe Biden’s massive climate bill passed Congress in 2022, Republican Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina complained it was boondoggle.                                             ","Ella Nilsen and Renée Rigdon, CNN","When President Joe Biden’s massive climate bill passed Congress in 2022, Republican Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina complained it was boondoggle. The Inflation Reduction Act, which contained the largest climate investment in US history, would “throw money at woke climate and social programs that won’t work — including over $350 billion for ‘Green New Deal’ initiatives,” Hudson said in a statement after IRA’s passage. But Hudson – now the head of House Republicans’ campaign committee – is one of the members of Congress whose district has benefitted the most from the climate law and its massive investment in clean energy. About $12.7 billion in private investment has been announced in Hudson’s district since the bill passed, the second-highest amount in the nation. Much of it is from Toyota expanding a gargantuan car battery plant that has tripled in size since it was first announced. The factory will span the length of 756 football fields and will spur 5,100 new jobs, the company estimates. Hudson isn’t alone. House Republicans uniformly voted against the IRA in August 2022 and have voted to repeal some of its biggest programs dozens of times, but their districts are disproportionately reaping its benefits. The vast majority of the $346-billion-worth of announced investments – nearly 78% – has gone to Republican congressional districts, according to a CNN analysis of data from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It’s much more Republican-skewed at the congressional district level than at the state level,” Trevor Houser, partner at Rhodium, told CNN. In a green twist of irony, the deluge of cash into red districts could actually save the climate law from total repeal if Republicans and former President Donald Trump win later this year. Hudson was measured in his criticism when CNN asked him if he would vote to fully repeal the climate law if Republicans win control. He told CNN he wasn’t aware of the specific numbers in his district, and said that instead of seeking a full repeal, he would seek targeted changes. “I think the experience with the [Affordable Care Act] tells us that rather than try to repeal one big bill with another big bill, we ought to look at the individual policies and the ones that we think are hurting American people,” Hudson told CNN. In states including Georgia, Arizona and Texas, House Republicans are seeing a deluge of cash and jobs flowing into their districts as companies use clean energy tax credits to construct factories to build EVs and their batteries, and as massive wind, solar, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel projects come online. In Georgia’s 11th district, Rep. Barry Loudermilk has touted the construction of a massive EV battery factory by Hyundai and SK Battery America, which is projected to create more than 3,500 jobs. The factory comprises nearly 70% of the $7.4 billion that has flowed into his district. “It’s an unbelievable advancement, the new battery plant is just unbelievably large,” said Loudermilk. Nationwide, about $268 billion in announced investments has gone to Republican-held districts, compared with about $77 billion going to Democratic districts. Democratic Rep. Troy Carter of Louisiana has around $13.2 billion flowing into his district – the most in the nation. Carter’s district, which snakes from Baton Rouge to New Orleans, is benefiting from several companies investing in hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture – industries related to Louisiana’s proximity to oil and gas. “Louisiana, once solely reliant on oil and gas extraction, has the workers and infrastructure to lead the nation in the green energy transition which will lead to good-paying careers at home,” Carter said in a statement, adding his state is “benefitting greatly” both from private and public investment from the law. Republican districts round out the top five with the largest sums in private investment.  Hudson comes in at number two, and the remaining three of the top five districts are in Texas: Reps. Michael Cloud, August Pfluger and Randy Weber. The big projects in each Texas district run the gamut from Tesla’s massive lithium refinery being constructed in Cloud’s south Texas district, dozens of wind, solar and battery storage projects, and sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen facilities. The reason so much private money has flowed to Republican districts is simple, according to Rhodium’s Houser: They have more land. “Republican districts tend to be more rural,” Houser said. “It’s very hard to build large industrial facilities in dense urban areas.” Comparatively, Rhodium and MIT’s data shows that retail sales of EVs and rooftop solar panels are stronger in Democratic districts (heat pumps are more popular in red districts due to their prolific use in the South). In addition, Republican states have laxer labor laws and several states, including Georgia, have put together enticing state tax packages to lure big companies. “That’s where the pro-business policies are,” Loudermilk said. “They’re going to areas that are welcome for growth and have limited obsessive regulation.” The cash advantage in GOP districts may ultimately protect Biden’s climate law, even if Republicans sweep the election. “I think the odds of complete repeal, even in the Republican trifecta, are very low,” Houser said. House Republicans have tried to repeal big pieces of the IRA several times, including voting to cut billions in tax subsidies. Those attempts haven’t gone anywhere in the Democratically controlled Senate. “We’re seeing a number of elected officials who decided they would vote against the IRA, and now they’re seeing the benefits delivering for their constituents, they are celebrating those benefits,” White House deputy chief of staff Natalie Quillian told CNN. “Because who wouldn’t celebrate more jobs, billions of dollars in investments in your community?” Quillian said the White House takes the threat of repealing Biden’s climate bill “very seriously.” “We take them at their word that they want to repeal this,” Quillian said. “Our job is to make sure that these investments land and then they stick.” Despite their party’s repeal attempts, some Republicans are working closely with clean energy companies in their districts to ensure new factories and jobs stick around for the long haul. “We are very well taken care of by our representatives in the Georgia government, and by our local representatives,” said Scott Moskowitz, the head of public affairs and market strategy at QCells North America, which is building a $2 billion solar panel manufacturing facility in Loudermilk’s district. “Congressman Loudermilk has been vocally supportive of what we’re doing and he recognizes it’s going to take a lot of tools for these critical industries to succeed longterm.” Several House Republicans CNN interviewed didn’t commit to backing a full repeal, but said they wanted to pare back elements of the law. For instance, Cloud, the Texas Republican whose district has seen nearly $9.8 billion announced investment, said he wants to put caps on the law’s clean energy tax credits, because the federal price tag has ballooned well beyond original estimates due to their popularity with businesses and consumers. “Even the authors of the bill have said, that was kind of an oversight not to put a cap on,” Cloud said, adding that IRA’s vast subsidies are “distorting the economy.” “I have talked to companies that have actually changed their business model to go after it,” Cloud said. Loudermilk, the Georgia Republican, told CNN he’s intent on repealing parts of the IRA, concerned the law is “trying to force a technology before it’s mature enough.” Some companies, aware of potentially shifting political winds, told CNN they’re making investment decisions in clean energy based on broader market demand. “Incentives can be helpful but are often temporary or subject to changing political dynamics,” Susan Elkington, Toyota’s senior vice president of electric vehicle supply, told CNN in an emailed statement. Rep. John Curtis, a Republican from Utah and founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus, said that even though the GOP opposed the partisan reconciliation process used to pass the IRA, the bill contains many things that Republicans like. “It’s a bit of a false narrative that you’re 100% in or 100% out on the IRA,” Curtis said. “I do think it’s a legitimate point that as these investments come into Republican districts, that makes it easier for Republicans to not necessarily support but see the impact of those.” Curtis, who is running for US Senate in Utah, said he thinks if Republicans take control in 2025, they’d pursue more limited rollbacks to the law, rather than full-scale repeal. Bob Keefe, executive director of clean energy group E2, said the law is already transformative for state and local economies. “Those opportunities would not exist without the IRA, regardless of what opponents of the IRA would say about it,” Keefe said. “It just wouldn’t have happened. This is how you rebuild an economy.” About this analysis: There are several data sets that track IRA investments in congressional districts, all of which differ slightly. CNN went with Rhodium and MIT data because it only includes projects that have at least entered final engineering and design or final site selection. It excludes projects where companies made initial announcements but then backed out of projects. This choice results in a higher likelihood the projects in our analysis will get built. CNN’s Lauren Fox contributed to this report."

","Ashley R. Williams and Mary Gilbert, CNN","The year’s most significant heat wave so far is expected to roast a large portion of the central and southern United States on Father’s Day Sunday with potentially record-breaking high temperatures, four days away from summer’s official start. The National Weather Service warned people in the South and Midwest planning to celebrate dads outdoors on Sunday to stay cool amid a major heat risk, with high temperatures into the 90s in some areas. The intense heat wave won’t stop there. An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome will build Sunday over the East and stretch into the Midwest and Great Lakes over the next few days, with the heat expected to persist through the week. Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The final Sunday of spring will be a scorcher in the Plains and Midwest, where temperatures will reach the mid- to upper 90s, according to the Weather Prediction Center. People living across the Great Lakes region can expect temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s. The Mississippi River Valley will be slammed with the worst of Sunday’s sweltering conditions, with large portions of both states facing a Level 3 – or major – risk of heat-related impacts. The National Weather Service office in St. Louis encouraged residents to take extra precautions Sunday for its hottest day of the year. “It will feel like 100-105 during the afternoon hours. We aren’t used to this kind of heat yet,” forecasters wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Sunday’s unrelenting heat will be felt across states including Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the weather service. Some smaller pockets of Level 4 – or extreme – heat will be felt in a few locations such as Atlanta, where Sunday afternoon temperatures could reach 94 degrees by the afternoon. Millions will face heat-related health risks as conditions reach extreme levels into this week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heat is the deadliest form of weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. The extreme temperatures and uncomfortable heat will seep into the larger cities of the Midwest and Northeast by the start of the workweek. On Monday, Chicago temperatures could hit 94 degrees with the heat index at 97 degrees, according to forecasters at Chicago’s weather service office. The high temperatures for the Upper Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions will soar into the mid- and upper 90s on Monday, with the possibility of tying or breaking numerous records, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The potential for record-shattering heat will last across the Ohio Valley and the Northeast through Friday, with some areas hitting heat indices of 105 degrees, the Weather Prediction Center said. A Level 3 heat risk is expected to affect large portions of states including Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on Monday, according to the weather service. Meanwhile, much of the southern half of Iowa faces an extreme heat risk on Monday. Weather service forecasters in Des Moines, Iowa, warned of high heat and humidity through Tuesday as temperatures push into the 90s and heat index values hit near-triple digits. “Morning lows will be just as impressive, as temperatures remain in the mid- to even upper 70s,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “The combination of heat, humidity and little overnight relief will bring potentially widespread, significant heat-related impacts to anyone without adequate hydration or reliable cooling,” according to the center. In Detroit, where daytime temperatures are expected to hit the high 90s, the city’s urban core won’t see much relief after dark, where weather service forecasters say overnight lows will only dip to the 70s this week. The sweltering conditions will continue to shift into the eastern and northeastern US by Tuesday. CNN’s Elisa Raffa contributed to this report."

Multiple all-time June high temperature records could fall as the heat rises to levels normally seen only on the hottest July days. Parts of the Midwest to the Northeast could endure the longest heat wave they’ve seen in decades, the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center said. Scientists have warned that heat waves will become increasingly severe as the climate crisis intensifies. Tens of millions of people who live as far north as Maine and aren’t used to heat this intense will be sweating in temperatures well into the 90s this week. It will feel even hotter than that as humidity helps drive heat index values – how temperatures feel to the body – into the low 100s. Read more: Search continues for US tourist and two others missing amid Greek heat wave An extreme heat risk is in place from the Great Lakes into the Northeast this week, according to the National Weather Service. Wednesday and Thursday will be the hottest days of the week, but the surrounding days will only be slightly less brutal. Heat will reach dangerous levels in many places including the major metropolitan areas of Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York City and Boston. Temperatures soared 15 to 20 degrees above normal Monday afternoon and remained at elevated levels overnight. A few dozen temperature records fell as a result, including daily record highs in Chicago and Cleveland, and daily record warm low temperatures in places like Des Moines, Iowa. Temperatures will rise up to 25 degrees above normal through the rest of the workweek. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven’t seen heat like this in about three decades. “Last time we saw heat in Pittsburgh like what we’re expecting next week was 30 yrs ago (almost to the day) when it reached 95°F or warmer for 6 straight days (June 15-20, 1994),” the local weather service office said on X. “That stands as the longest stretch of 95+ (degree) days on record. We have a shot at tying or beating that.” Some affected areas have started to activate heat protocols. Cooling centers will open across New York City starting Tuesday and cooling kits will be distributed to people working outdoors, Mayor Eric Adams said Monday. Burlington, Vermont, will also activate cooling centers starting Tuesday, according to the city. Recreation centers in Cleveland will be open for extended hours this week to serve as cooling centers, city officials said Monday. The city also suspended all playground programs for the week as temperatures soar. Heat domes like the one fueling this week’s intense conditions trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The oven-like conditions mean overnight temperatures often don’t cool down enough to offer relief for overheated bodies, posing increased risks for heat-related illness. “Warm overnight temperatures only dropping into the mid-70s will offer little to no relief, especially to those without adequate or reliable cooling,” the Weather Prediction Center said. Humidity will also join forces with extreme heat to create triple-digit heat indices – measurements of how hot the human body feels – in some areas. Chicago residents could feel heat indices between 95 and 105 degrees through next week, the NWS in Chicago warned. Parts of eastern New York and western New England could see indices as high as 107 degrees. The NWS in Detroit, where the heat index could reach 100 degrees, urged residents to practice heat safety in the coming days, including limiting strenuous outdoor activities, staying hydrated, and checking up on neighbors who are elderly or don’t have A/C. Heat-related illness is a concern in severely impacted areas, particularly for the elderly, young children and outdoor workers. Extreme heat is by far the deadliest form of severe weather, killing on average twice as many people a year as tornadoes and hurricanes combined. CNN’s Robert Shackelford, Celina Tebor and Zenebou Sylla contributed to this report."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/employer-obligations-worker-safety-heat-waves/index.html,Forecast: Very hot. What your employer should be doing to protect you on high-heat days,06-18-2024,"                                                 Summer is just starting in North America, and already an intense “heat dome” is forecast to affect more than half the US population this week.                                             ","Jeanne Sahadi, CNN","Summer is just starting in North America, and already an intense “heat dome” is forecast to affect more than half the US population this week. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven’t seen heat like this in about three decades. Along with stifling days comes the risk of developing dangerous heat-related conditions, such as dehydration, heat stress, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and other hazards. While you can take as many measures as you like to stay cool at home, what about when you go to work? What responsibilities does your employer have to prevent you from suffering a heat-related illness? And what can you do if you think those aren’t being met? Under the federal law that created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, employers always have a duty to keep your workplace free of known hazards. “This includes protecting workers from heat-related hazards,” OSHA notes on its website. And it applies whether you work outdoors or indoors. While some states have specific laws governing occupational heat exposure, there is no heat-specific federal regulation mandating how employers must prevent heat illness in the workplace. But they are expected to “take reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.” Nor is there a specific threshold that defines “extreme heat,” although OSHA said it is working “towards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.” The heat an employee’s body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature. “For someone working outside without shade and working on cement – the heat index is going to be higher for them than [if the thermometer says] it’s 85 degrees,” said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases. The same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn’t breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee’s underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks. All that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days. They recommend companies: Have a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress. Make water easily accessible. “Encourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,” according to OSHA recommendations. Allow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area. Give employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called “20% rule.” “On the first day, don’t allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.” In a worker’s first few days, the agency notes, “absolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously” and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they’ve developed a heat-related illness. “New employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable — nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,” OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert. Encourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing. Monitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and “when in doubt, call 911,” OSHA recommends. Change work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees’ working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day — such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues. To find out more about your particular employer’s obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company’s safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted. Next, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules. If you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. “You have the right to speak up about hazards without fear of retaliation,” OSHA notes. The agency also noted that it “is planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.” Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement. And, it added, “OSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.”"

",Opinion by Mark Wolfe,"Editor’s Note: Mark Wolfe is an energy economist and serves as the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, representing the state directors of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and co-director of the Center on Climate, Energy and Poverty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Summer starts Thursday, and record-breaking temperatures are already cascading across the United States. Triple-digit temperatures have hit the western states, with the Northeast, Midwest and Great Lakes regions expected to see extreme heat waves this week. Current US strategies for keeping families cool, including access to cooling centers — temporary shelters during heat waves — may have worked when temperatures were lower and the duration of heat waves was shorter, but in today’s climate, these outdated cooling methods are inadequate. Weather-related deaths from extreme heat are more common than from those from hurricanes, floods, extreme cold and other natural disasters. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1,220 people die from extreme heat every year. And some experts think that these numbers understate the full extent of the problem because of a lack of consistent methods to record these deaths. We need a full paradigm shift in policy to deploy the right solutions to the people who need them most. The cost of home cooling has been rising steadily for the last 10 years, in part because families need to purchase more electricity to cool their homes as temperatures continue to rise. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) and the Center for Energy Poverty and Climate project that the financial burden to families of keeping cool this summer will increase by 7.9% across the United States to an average of $719 from June through September. That’s up from $661 during the same period last year. Low-income families will be at greatest risk of falling behind on their utility bills this summer, and therefore of facing utility shutoffs and suffering dangerous health effects of extreme heat exposure. The average energy burden for low-income households is about 8.6% of income, three times the rate for non-low-income households (3%). And according to the US Energy Information Administration, almost 20% of low-income families making less than $20,000 per year reported having no air-conditioning equipment in 2020. Increasing access to adequate cooling throughout the summer months for these families is imperative. As of now, only 17 states and Washington, DC have protections against utility shutoffs during the summer, and many of those protections are limited in scope to periods of extreme temperatures. To make matters worse, funding for the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides formula grants to states to help struggling households pay their energy bills, has been reduced from $6.1 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $4.1 billion for fiscal year 2024, leaving states with few options other than reducing assistance. Congress must restore the $2 billion that was cut from LIHEAP back to the program this year. But, given that’s not likely, utilities across the United States should agree to voluntarily suspend power shutoffs during the summer. They should also add bill payment assistance programs that provide a set of tiered discounts that reflect households’ abilities to pay. Several states have already implemented different levels of utility discounts with successful outcomes, including Connecticut, which just put into effect a program providing a discount on monthly electric utility bills of up to 50% for low-income families. Long term, we need to invest in solutions that we know work and are cost-effective. Federal programs, like the longstanding Weatherization Assistance Program and the more recently passed Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program, can lead the way to helping low-income families stay safe in their homes during both the winter heating and summer cooling seasons. But they must be adequately funded to reach their full potential. During periods of extreme heat, cooling is not just a luxury that provides comfort, but a necessary measure that helps families across all income brackets, and especially low-income families, stay safe."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/19/climate/extreme-heat-brain-greece-tourists/index.html,Why some scientists think extreme heat could be the reason people keep disappearing in Greece,06-19-2024,"                                                 As climate change fuels longer and more severe heat waves, scientists are trying to unravel the impacts of extreme heat on the body, and in particular the brain.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","It was a shock when Michael Mosley, a doctor and well-known TV presenter in the UK, was found dead earlier this month after hiking in scorching temperatures on the Greek island of Symi. But it is now one of a series of tourist deaths and disappearances in Greece as the country endures a powerful, early summer heat wave with temperatures pushing above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). On Saturday, a Dutch tourist was found dead on the island of Samos. The following day, the body of an American tourist was found on Mathraki, a small island west of Corfu. Albert Calibet, another American tourist, has been missing since he set out for a hike on June 11 on Amorgos. And two French women disappeared on Sikinos after going for a walk. The bodies of those who died still need to be examined to establish the precise cause of death, but authorities are warning people not to underestimate the impacts of the searing temperatures. “There is a common pattern,” Petros Vassilakis, the police spokesman for the Southern Aegean, told Reuters, “they all went for a hike amid high temperatures.” Some scientists say what’s happening in Greece offers a warning sign about the impacts of extreme heat on the body, and in particular the brain, potentially causing confusion, affecting people’s decision-making abilities and even their perception of risk. As climate change fuels longer and more severe heat waves, scientists are trying to unravel how our brains will cope. Research has traditionally focused on the impact of extreme heat on muscles, skin, the lungs and the heart, but “the brain, for me, is the key to it all,” said Damian Bailey, a physiology and biochemistry professor at the University of South Wales. It’s the “master switch” for the body, he told CNN. It’s in the brain that body temperature is regulated. The hypothalamus, a small diamond-shape structure, acts as a thermostat. It performs a delicate dance to keep the body’s internal temperature at or very close to 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit). When it’s hot, the hypothalamus activates the sweat glands and widens blood vessels to cool the body down. But the brain functions well within a narrow range of temperatures and even small changes can affect it. Many people will be familiar with a feeling of slowness and laziness on a warm summer’s day. But as heat increases, it can have serious effects, including lowering the fluids in the body and decreasing blood flow to the brain, Bailey said. He compares the brain to a Hummer — it needs vast resources to function. Tests he has run on research participants in an environmental chamber, where he cranked temperatures up from 21 to 40 degrees Celsius (around 70 to 104 Fahrenheit), showed a drop in blood flow to the brain by about 9% to 10%. “That is a big deal in terms of not getting enough fuel into an engine which is running at high end all of the time,” Bailey said. And it has an impact. Extreme heat can disrupt typical brain activity, said Kim Meidenbauer, a neuroscientist at Washington State University. The brain networks that usually allow people to think clearly, to reason, to remember, and to construct and formulate ideas, can get “thrown out of whack,” she told CNN. It gets harder to make complex decisions, such as which path to take on a hike — a decision that sounds simple but requires weighing multiple different factors. There’s also evidence to suggest people are more likely to make risky decisions and engage in impulsive behavior when they’re exposed to heat, she added. An altered perception of risk coupled with impaired cognitive function can have very serious consequences. “You’re not just talking about potentially getting a little bit too warm and maybe having a sunburn,” she said. “You’re talking about potentially life-threatening (situations), like making poor decisions, having your judgement clouded.” Scientists are only just beginning to unravel the range of impacts heat has on the brain, not just in terms of decision-making but mood, emotions and mental health. “Our understanding is really pretty minimal,” Meidenbauer said. “It’s a major unknown at this point.” Some people are more vulnerable to heat than others. Older people, especially those over 65, are more at risk, because their bodies don’t always thermoregulate as well. The people who have gone missing in Greece were all in their mid-50s and older. Very young children and pregnant women also face elevated risk, as do those with pre-existing conditions, including mental health conditions. But heat can be dangerous for anyone. In 2016, a team of scientists followed 44 college students during a heat wave in Boston and found those without air conditioning experienced significant declines in cognitive performance. “No one is immune to the health effects of heat,” said Jose Guillermo Cedeño Laurent, one of the research authors and an assistant professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health. “Our brain is an exquisitely sensitive organ,” he said. Someone who is very fit understands the dangers and carries plenty of water is still gambling if they decide to go on a hike in very high temperatures, Bailey said. “You make wrong decisions and it can cost you your life.” There are behavioral things people can do to protect themselves and lower risk, experts say. These include not exercising during the hottest parts of the day, instead going in the coolest parts of the day and seeking shade when possible. Wearing loose clothing and applying ice packs to the head and neck can also help. Drinking water is vital and not just when you feel very thirsty, Bailey said. It’s important not to get to a point where the body is losing fluids faster than it can take them on. Experts also recommend electrolyte drinks, which can help replace some of the fluids lost through sweating. Use location-sharing apps, said Meidenbauer. “Make sure someone knows where you are.” Over the long term, regular exercise is important — providing it’s not outside during the hottest parts of the day — as it can help the body thermoregulate. “The fitter you are the more resilient you are to these climatic environmental stresses,” Bailey said. It will take time to unravel the exact causes of death of those who lost their lives in Greece but there is a lesson that can still be taken away from the tragedies, Bailey said. “No matter how intelligent or how fit you might think you are … if you’re going out in 40 degrees celsius plus temperatures, even if you’re well prepared, you’re running the gauntlet.” CNN’s Stephanie Halasz and Issy Ronald contributed to this report."

A heat wave unlike any seen in decades is sweeping large parts of the US, which is also grappling with deadly wildfires, storms and severe flooding. Hundreds of people have died as temperatures rose to 120 degrees Fahrenheit during the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. And India is currently grappling with a deadly summer heat wave which has killed dozens of people. The report also shows that even though the world is adding clean, renewables at record levels, global energy demand is growing so fast that fossil fuels are filling the gaps. Last year was “another year of highs in our energy hungry world,” said Juliet Davenport, president of the Energy Institute. “Energy is central to human progress,” she added. “It is also now central to our very survival.” Global consumption of oil, coal and gas rose by 1.5% in 2023, driven in particular by a strong growth in oil. Last year, the world consumed more than 100 million barrels a day for the first time, the report found. The US remained the largest oil producer, growing its output by 8% last year. Overall, the proportion of fossil fuels in the 2023 global energy mix remained largely the same at 81.5%, down just 0.5% from the previous year. Fossil fuel growth was particularly strong in developing economies, the report found. India’s fossil fuel consumption was up 8% last year and, for the first time ever, the country used more coal than Europe and North America, combined. In China, fossil fuel use soared to a new record high in 2023, up by 6%, as the end of its extended Covid lockdowns led to a rebound in fossil fuels. However, the share of fossil fuels in the country’s overall energy mix is declining, as China continues to add huge amounts of renewables. The report does point to some positive developments. Fossil fuel use in major advanced economies is likely to have peaked and is beginning to fall, it found. In the US, fossil fuels fell to 80% of total energy consumed. In Europe, fossil fuels made up less than 70% of the energy mix for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, driven by reduced demand and renewable energy growth. Energy generation from renewables, excluding hydropower, was up 13% almost entirely due to a boom in wind and solar, according to the report, although the rise in renewables was not enough to match increased global demand for energy, which rose 2% in 2023. “In a year where we have seen the contribution of renewables reaching a new record high, ever increasing global energy demand means the share coming from fossil fuels has remained virtually unchanged,” said Simon Varley, vice chair and head of energy and Natural Resources at the firm KPMG, which co-authored the report. Dave Jones, global insights director at climate think tank Ember, who was not involved in the report, said it should be a wake-up call for governments to act. “The world is still as hungry as ever for energy. To turn the tide on fossil fuel use, renewables needs to rise much faster, whilst keeping an eye on use energy less wastefully,” he told CNN. To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a target countries agreed to in the Paris Agreement in 2015, the world needs to roughly halve emissions by the end of this decade."

This research could have combatted heat waves. So why was it shut down?                                             ",Opinion by Anna Bershteyn and Michael Diamond,"Editor’s Note: Dr. Anna Bershteyn, PhD, is an associate professor of Population Health at New York University Grossman School of Medicine. Michael S. Diamond, PhD, is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science at Florida State University. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN. A first-of-its-kind climate science research program was just shut down in Alameda, California by local leaders, against the advice of city staff and experts who confirmed the safety and value of the research. The program intended to study how tiny particles called aerosols move in the atmosphere by spraying sea-salt mist on the flight deck of the USS Hornet Sea, Air and Space Museum. The research could help address one of the greatest areas of uncertainty in projecting our future climate and, potentially, inform future methods to combat heat waves. The Earth’s atmosphere is full of naturally derived aerosols such as pollen, dust and sea salt from ocean spray — as well as aerosols from human-caused pollution. While greenhouse gas pollution warms the Earth by acting like a heat-trapping blanket, aerosol pollution can be thought of as a light parasol, partly shielding us from the sun’s rays. Aerosols cool the climate by reflecting sunlight directly and, even more powerfully, by brightening clouds. This effect can be seen from space as bright streaks trailing cargo ships, spewing pollution aerosols from burning sludgy fuels as they travel across the oceans. Up until now, this aerosol “parasol” has masked around one-third of the warming effect from our greenhouse gas emissions. That is starting to change, however, because new laws have dramatically curbed ship pollution over the oceans and countries like China have reduced pollution on land. Cutting aerosol pollution is a double edged sword; it has important and necessary public health benefits, but it also means the climate is set to warm even more. Exactly how much more is still unknown because quantifying how much aerosols influence clouds remains one of the largest unsolved problems in climate science. Understanding the effects of aerosols on climate could help protect people from deadly heat. Around a billion people live in areas projected to get so hot and humid that being away from air conditioning is life-threatening. All humans, no matter how physically fit, have limits to the heat we can withstand before internal body temperatures rise to deadly levels. Life-threatening, humid heat is becoming more common in many parts of the world, including Bangladesh, the Persian Gulf, and even parts of the US, such as Florida and Texas. In some of these places, air conditioning is scarce — and even where it is available, a power blackout or brownout could be a death sentence. The Alameda program would have included research related to both general aerosol effects and to marine cloud brightening (MCB), an idea for brightening clouds with sea-salt spray instead of pollution. There are still key areas of research that need attention in order to determine if MCB would be feasible, which is why numerous scientific advisory reports have recommended research on rapid climate interventions like MCB, including small-scale field studies to advance our knowledge about how aerosols and clouds interact in the real environment. The small sea salt studies that were halted in Alameda could have helped improve computer models that project how much reducing pollution aerosols will warm the climate, and in what situations MCB might save lives by cooling it. Some might be wondering: Why bother with ideas like MCB when we know the only long-term solution is to stop emitting greenhouse gasses? For starters, deadly heat is already here — hundreds died in Phoenix’s record-breaking heat last summer — and this summer is already hotter than last. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions has much-needed, but gradual effects on climate, meaning that even if emissions reduction efforts are highly successful, more warming will occur over the next few decades. What’s needed is both an end to greenhouse gas emissions and protection from heat emergencies in the near-term. These aren’t conflicting goals, but two indispensable parts of climate planning. What we’ve learned from crises like Covid-19 is that, if science isn’t yet mature when an emergency happens, we’re mired in confusion about what works and waste time grasping at straws like ineffective treatments. In deadly heat waves — especially combined with power grid failures, which are expected in places like Texas, and in parts of the world with little air conditioning — local agencies might try MCB-like approaches in a desperate bid to reduce temperatures and save lives. But if this happens before scientists have time to properly study the science underlying MCB and similar interventions, the effects will be hard to predict — and far more likely to fail. Undertaking the sea salt research as part of a museum exhibit and educational program in Alameda could have been a transformative opportunity to educate the public about climate science and the role of aerosols. Some Alameda residents argued against permitting the research with “not in my backyard” vigor, not because they don’t want to protect future generations from deadly heat, but out of fear of the unknown. Many others spoke up in favor, seeing science and information as important for the community and the climate. Meanwhile, the City of Alameda performed its own environmental and health reviews and found  that the studies would not be harmful to people or animals near the site. Public education on aerosols and MCB is desperately needed — and would have been one of the best parts of the Alameda program if it had gone forward. Small-scale sea salt research like that proposed in Alameda will not affect clouds or the climate, but it will improve scientific understanding of whether it’s possible to cool down areas experiencing deadly heatwaves. It’s possible that the research might prove MCB isn’t viable — which would be good to know so resources and time aren’t wasted during a climate emergency. On the other hand, it might show how to use MCB to save lives from a human-made crisis. With so much at stake, shouldn’t we study every possible solution, and in the most open ways possible?"

Meanwhile, a tropical system could develop this weekend through the southwest Gulf of Mexico. Here’s the latest: • Millions of Americans under heat alerts: More than 100 million Americans, including those in the highly populated I-95 corridor, are under heat alerts through the weekend. A heat emergency is in effect for Washington, DC, where the temperature skyrocketed to 100º F, the first time the city has recorded a temperature that high since 2012. • Tropical system could develop: A new tropical system could develop quick this weekend on the heels of Alberto. A system with a medium chance of tropical development could mimic Alberto’s track through the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and into northeastern Mexico this weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center. While this system is not expected to be as large as Alberto, it could bring more rain to South Texas and trigger new flooding concerns there and along the Gulf Coast. • Sizzling temperatures return to California: Heat alerts in California span parts of southern and central California, including in Colusa County, where firefighters are working to rein in the Sites Fire spanning over 19,100 acres. High temperatures between 100 and 106 are expected and could hinder firefighting efforts. California is seeing an active early fire year, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Since the start of the year, more than 89,700 acres have burned, compared to 5,747 acres during the same period last year. • ‘Catastrophic flooding’ in Iowa: On Saturday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties in northwest Iowa and directed all available state resources to assist Rock Valley and other communities in response to “catastrophic flooding.” In Rock Valley, all residences north of Highway 18 were being evacuated amid high floodwaters. There’s a level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Saturday over northern Iowa, and that corner of the state has seen an estimated 10-plus inches of rain based on radar. The heaviest rain is expected further east. And in nearby Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nine people have been rescued in the past 24 hours from rising water due to heavy rainfall, according to City Emergency Manager Regan Smith. • Flood threat in fire zone: A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning and more rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods. • Search for “more loss of life” in New Mexico fires: In New Mexico, authorities reported that at least two people died, 1,400 structures were destroyed and more than 8,000 residents were evacuated as a result of wildfires. The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for “more loss of life.” The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas. Ruidoso residents will be allowed to return to their homes Monday, and authorities ask that they bring at least a week’s worth of food and drinking water, as grocery stores are not operating at full capacity. Meanwhile, FBI special agents have joined the investigation into the cause of wildfires. More record daily high temperatures are possible through the weekend as heat expands into new areas and intensifies in others. The extreme heat and humidity will combine to push the heat index – or how hot it feels – to 100 to 105 degrees over a widespread area, with 110 degrees possible in the southern mid-Atlantic. Record overnight low temperatures will increase health risks by reducing the ability for people to cool down at night. The nation’s capital could potentially hit 100 degrees for the first time in eight years. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said an extended heat emergency will remain activated throughout the weekend and into next week. The National Weather Service said widespread temperatures in the upper 90s and even triple digits will be possible in the city. The city officially recorded a temperature of 100 degrees Saturday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Thursday signed a state of preparedness declaration ahead of the potentially hazardous heat wave. An excessive heat watch has been issued for most of the region for Saturday, according to the National Weather Service, with dangerous heat possible and the heat expected to feel between 105 and 110 degrees. The heat wave’s prolonged nature is a serious concern. New York City residents could experience 90-degree temperatures or higher this weekend into early next week. The stretch would be the longest ever in June in the city. For the first time this year, the National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for the city. Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday announced the opening of the state’s emergency operations center, which she said will monitor conditions and share resources with emergency management personnel across the state’s 62 counties. Earlier this week, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said cooling centers will be open across the city. Philadelphia has extended a heat health emergency through midnight on Sunday, according to the state’s Department of Public Health. Philadelphia has heat alerts in place through the weekend, with temperatures expected to feel close to 99 degrees. New Jersey’s heat alerts are in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. It will feel around 100 degrees across the state Saturday and Sunday. Heat is also returning in full force in the West following a brief break. Heat alerts are already in place for portions of California, Arizona and Utah. Temperatures are expected to jump back up to 10 to 15 degrees above normal for Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Bakersfield, California, through the weekend. CNN’s Allison Chinchar, Eric Zerkel, Brandon Miller, Taylor Ward, Sara Tonks, Taylor Galgano, Andy Rose, Josh Campbell, Rebekah Riess, and Kara Devlin contributed to this report."

Here’s the latest. • Heat heads to the South: The unrelenting heat shifts into the South and Southern Plains on Monday and Tuesday, bringing temperatures in the mid to upper 90s. Some cities could even see 100-degree highs, including Dallas and Little Rock, Arkansas. The heat index – a measurement of how the body feels in humidity and high temperatures – could top a dangerous 110 degrees in some areas. • Minnesota dam compromised: Southern Minnesota’s Rapidan Dam is in “imminent failure condition” after this weekend’s dangerous flooding, Blue Earth County Emergency Management warned Monday. The dam – about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis – was intact as of late Monday morning, but water was flowing around it. No evacuation orders were issued as of late Monday morning. • Flood-stricken communities begin recovery amid sweltering heat: Heat alerts on Monday spread over 1,000 miles from North Florida to South Dakota, which was among several states inundated by heavy rain and devastating flooding over the weekend. Heat advisories are in effect for several areas that were swamped with floodwater over the weekend, including parts of northern Iowa, southern South Dakota, eastern Nebraska and northern Missouri and Kansas. President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Iowa after catastrophic flooding forced some communities to evacuate. • Record-breaking weekend heat: Daily high-temperature records were broken from New York to Mississippi over the weekend, including some that were more than a century old, as a brutal heat wave embraced the mid-Atlantic and I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C. to New York. Philadelphia hit 98 degrees on Sunday, shattering its 1888 record of 97 degrees. Both Greenville, Mississippi, and Raleigh, North Carolina, saw a record 100 degrees. People in the region can breathe a sigh of relief Monday as cooler temperatures begin to set in. • Flooding turns deadly in South Dakota: At least one person died during severe flooding in South Dakota, Governor Kristi Noem said. “I want to remind everybody to remember the power of water and the flow of water, and to stay away from flooded areas,” the governor warned. At least nine people were rescued from rising water in Sioux Falls, where emergency personnel reported stranded drivers and dozens of trapped vehicles. And the flood threat still isn’t over – several rivers in the state are swollen with floodwater and will continue rising over the next few days, Noem said. • More than 20 rivers at major flood stage: Flood warnings remain across waterlogged areas of South Dakota, Iowa and southern Minnesota, as well as along rivers that are running well above normal. At least 23 river gauges have reached major flood stage in the area, meaning extensive flooding of buildings, main roadways, and other critical infrastructure is possible, according to the National Weather Service. That number is expected to grow as water continues to collect across creeks and streams, eventually dumping into major rivers. • “Monsoon-like” conditions coming to the Southwest: An influx of tropical moisture – some of which is from Tropical Storm Alberto – is bringing “monsoon-like conditions” to the Southwest, the Weather Prediction Center said. Thunderstorms are possible through midweek as a result. While the rainfall may be welcomed by firefighters battling several active wildfires in the region, too much rain could trigger flooding and debris flows, making it difficult for crews to access burn areas. A heat dome building over the southwestern and south-central US early this week will push temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal each afternoon in an area spanning from the West into the Southeast. High temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s are expected Monday from southern South Dakota through the Southeast. A handful of daily record high temperatures could fall in parts of Nebraska and Kansas, and a few are at risk in Mississippi. The southern tier of the country will remain the epicenter for sizzling conditions Tuesday with high temperatures in the low 100s likely in the southern Plains and Southeast. Atlanta is forecast to top out in the upper 90s both Tuesday and Wednesday, about 10 degrees above normal for late June. By Wednesday, heat will briefly shift back into some of the same areas of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast that baked last week, but it won’t touch the extreme nature of last week’s oven-like conditions. Temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s will return in the mid-Atlantic and 90s will return as far north as southern New England. A few daily high temperature records are in jeopardy Wednesday – including DC and Baltimore – but much of the northeast US will avoid unseasonable heat. There will be rain chances for heavily flooded areas of the Midwest most of this week. A level 2 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms is in effect over the area Monday and Tuesday and some of these storms could unload rounds of heavy rainfall. Exactly how much rain falls and where depends on how thunderstorms develop each afternoon, but the heaviest storms could unload more than an inch of rain in a short time. That’s more than enough to cause additional flooding concerns in areas that can’t take much more rain. Storms are expected to roar to life each day in the late afternoon or early evening hours and remain a threat overnight. Damaging wind gusts and hail are also threats with any severe thunderstorm early this week. After a brief break on Wednesday, additional heavy rain is possible in the same areas Thursday and Friday. CNN’s Jamiel Lynch and Andy Rose contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","The Antarctic ice sheet is melting in a new, worrying way that scientific models used to project future sea level rise have not taken into account, suggesting current projections could be significantly underestimating the problem, according to a new study. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey found that warm ocean water is seeping beneath the ice sheet at its “grounding line” — the point at which the ice rises from the seabed and starts to float — causing accelerated melting which could lead to a tipping point, according to the report published Tuesday in the journal Nature Geoscience. A tipping point refers to the threshold at which a series of small changes accumulate to push a system beyond a point of no return. The melting works like this: relatively warm ocean water opens cavities in the ice, allowing more water to seep in, which causes more melting and larger cavities to form, and so on. A small increase in ocean temperatures can have a very big impact on the amount of melting, the study found. As climate change heats up the oceans, the process speeds up. “You get this kind of runaway feedback,” said Alex Bradley, an ice dynamics researcher at BAS and lead author of the paper. It behaves like a tipping point, he told CNN, “where you can have a very sudden shift in how much melting is happening in these places.” This tipping point would play out through a faster flow of ice into the oceans, in a process not currently included in models of future sea level rise, Bradley said, suggesting “our projections of sea level rise might be significant underestimates,” he added. The implications wouldn’t be felt immediately, according to the study, but would see a higher rise in sea levels accumulating over tens and hundreds of years, threatening coastal communities around the world. The study does not give time frames for when the tipping point might be reached, nor does it give figures for how much sea level rise can be expected. But the region is hugely significant: the Antarctic ice sheet already sheds an average of 150 billion metric tons of ice every year and, in its entirety, it holds enough water to raise global sea levels by around 190 feet (around 58 meters). The study is not the first to point to Antarctica’s vulnerabilities to the climate crisis. A slew of research points to the vulnerability of West Antarctica in particular, especially the Thwaites Glacier, known as the Doomsday Glacier for the catastrophic impact it could have on sea level rise. But what surprised Bradley about this study, which used climate modeling to understand how this melting mechanism could affect the whole ice sheet, is that some of the most vulnerable glaciers were those in East Antarctica. Eric Rignot, professor of Earth system science at the University of California at Irvine, who was not involved in the research, told CNN the study “encourages us to take a closer look at physical processes taking place in grounding zones.” “But this is a very complex, poorly observed region and a lot more research and field observations are needed,” he cautioned, including establishing what processes control the intrusion of ocean water beneath the ice and exactly how this affects the ice melting. Recent research from West Antarctica found melting at the base of glaciers was actually lower than expected, because it was being suppressed by a layer of colder, fresher water — although scientists still found a rapid retreat. Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, said the new model developed by the BAS scientists “is potentially very important” but it should be looked at together with more recent findings, including mechanisms of ice melt as well as the impacts tides have on pumping seawater beneath the ice. Bradley hopes the study will prompt more research into which regions might be most at risk and will give added impetus for policies to tackle the climate crisis. “With every small increase in ocean temperature, with every small increase in climate change, we get closer to these tipping points,” he said."

Never.,06-25-2024,                                                 Summer is off to a sweltering start after multiple record-breaking heat events sent temperatures soaring for millions of people. Here’s what to expect moving forward                                             ,"Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Summer is off to a sweltering start after multiple record-breaking heat events sent temperatures soaring for millions of people in the US. So when will it end? Forecasts for the coming weeks and months show exceptional heat is largely here to stay, with only fleeting periods of respite. And the sobering summer reality on a planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution is the heat isn’t going anywhere – it’s only going to get more frequent and intense as global temperatures rise. “Summers like the one we are experiencing now and the summer we had last year – which was the hottest on record – are going to become par for the course in the years ahead,” said Kristina Dahl, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. There will still be colder-than-average summers in the future, but climate change is making it likelier more summers will end up hotter-than-average, Dahl told CNN. And the fingerprints of a changing climate are already visible, even before summer has reached its hottest months. This spring, hundreds of cities in the eastern half of the US experienced one of their 10 hottest Mays on record in what was another sign of a changing climate: dangerous heat seeping into typically cooler seasons. Early season heat waves add to the danger of what’s already the deadliest weather threat because the body can’t gradually acclimatize, or cope better with the heat, Dahl explained. Acclimation or not, the abnormally hot temperatures are also altering the perception of what’s hot. Temperatures through at least midweek will climb up to 10 degrees above normal in parts of the western and southern US, but that pales in comparison to last week’s roasting conditions. Summer should be hot, just not this hot: Parts of the central and eastern US sweltered through temperatures 25 or 30 degrees above normal last week. The heat was so extreme Caribou, Maine, a town just 10 miles from the Canadian border, hit 96 degrees, tying its all-time record high temperature. “This is not your grandmother’s heat, this is significantly different,” Dahl said. “This (heat) really isn’t normal and it’s measurably influenced by climate change.” Forecasts for the next few weeks, the next month and the rest of the summer all show one trend clearer than anything else: hotter-than-average temperatures for large sections of the US. Above average temperatures are expected into early July for a vast majority of the Lower 48 with the exception of states along the northernmost tier of the country, according to forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center. July is typically the hottest month of the year, but it is expected to be even hotter than normal this summer in almost every state. Most of the East and parts of the Rockies are likely to be the most anomalously warm areas next month. This prolonged heat could be record-breaking. Last July in Phoenix was the hottest month ever experienced in any US city. The city’s average July temperature – calculated based on both high and low temperatures for the month – was an astonishing 102.7 degrees. Heat in Phoenix last summer wasn’t just extreme, it was long-lasting. Its longevity and dangerously high daytime and overnight temperatures took a toll on human health. The scorching July contributed to the deadliest year for heat in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, since officials began keeping records in 2003. Heat lasted well beyond July last summer for much of the US. A series of unrelenting heat domes baked huge parts of the country with the effects of each worsened by the one before. Every heat dome that parked over part of the country roasted the ground, dried out soils and made subsequent temperatures even hotter. This year looks to be no different. Warmer-than-normal conditions are expected to extend through the summer and most of the fall, according to the CPC. Warmer-than-normal falls aren’t nearly as dangerous as hot summers. But the cooler seasons only mask the lingering threat of extreme heat as long as global temperatures continue to rise, which scientists say can only be mitigated by dramatically reducing or phasing out planet-polluting fossil fuel use. “The more we try to normalize (heat), the greater the danger we have of taking our eye off the ball in terms of what needs to be done to address climate change,” Dahl said."

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Hot and humid conditions are building over the Northeast – including parts of the I-95 corridor – marking the return of uncomfortable air for millions of people after a short reprieve earlier this week. This sticky summertime air will also prime the atmosphere for potentially feisty storms when a cold front slices through the area later Wednesday afternoon and evening. A level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from parts of Ohio and Kentucky to New York, New Jersey and Delaware, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York City could all encounter damaging storms. A few thunderstorms will develop by mid-afternoon in parts of Ohio and western New York and expand south and east. These storms could increase in both strength and scope as the afternoon progresses. Any potent thunderstorms that develop will likely reach parts of the I-95 corridor by late afternoon or early evening. Damaging wind gusts and heavy rainfall are the greatest threats posed by the strongest storms, but hail and an isolated tornado or two cannot be ruled out. Any rainfall will ultimately be beneficial for the region, which dried out after being scorched by an intense heat wave last week. But flash flooding could result if heavy rain falls too fast, especially in low-lying or poor-drainage areas. Some thunderstorms may initially develop separately from one another only to ultimately congeal and form powerful lines that deliver greater wind damage. Power outages may ramp up in this scenario, especially if damaging winds roar over densely populated urban areas. The storm threat will largely cease during the overnight hours as thunderstorms push off the coast and out over the Atlantic. A much-needed break from intense summer heat will arrive in the wake of Wednesday’s storms. Temperatures will return to near-normal levels for much of the northeastern US Thursday and persist into the end of the week."

","Lex Harvey, CNN","The world’s largest capital cities are seeing more extremely hot days than ever, according to a new study, which says the dangerous trend is being driven by scorching temperatures across Asia as the climate crisis worsens. The world’s 20 most populous cities – together home to more than 300 million people – have seen a 52% jump in the number of days exceeding 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past three decades, according to an analysis by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) published on Friday. From Buenos Aires, Argentina to the French capital Paris and Egypt’s Cairo, the study found with each passing decade, as human-caused greenhouse gas emissions rise, major capital cities are recording more and more extremely hot days – posing threats to human health, economies and infrastructure. “Climate change is not just a future threat – it’s already happening and getting worse,” IIED senior researcher Tucker Landesman said in a press release. “In just one generation, there’s been an alarming increase in the number of days of extreme heat affecting some of the world’s biggest capital cities - made worse by the urban heat island effect,” which occurs when cities replace natural land with roads and buildings that retain more heat. Asian cities, which make up about half of the world’s most populous capitals, saw some of the biggest temperature increases – a trend that’s evident in recent heat waves across the continent, from Southeast Asia to China and India. Asia is uniquely vulnerable to climate risks, due to its high population, poverty, and proportion of people living in low-lying areas, prone to flooding, sea level rise and other natural disasters. New Delhi topped the list of hottest cities, recording 4,222 days above 35 degrees Celsius in the past three decades – more than any other city analyzed. Between 2014 and 2023, just under half (44%) of days in the Indian capital met that threshold, compared to 35% from 1994 to 2003, and 37% from 2004 to 2013. The capital region is only getting hotter. In late May, one part of Delhi reached 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) – the city’s highest temperature on record, straining India’s electricity grid and power supply. The heat also persisted into nighttime, leaving little respite for residents. “We’ve been living in this neighborhood for 40 years, but we have never seen a summer like this,” Kalyani Saha, a 60-year-old resident of Lajpat Nagar in South East Delhi, told CNN. “We get water only once a day, and it’s scalding hot, unless you fill up a bucket and let it cool off all day before using it, you can’t bathe in this water.” A Delhi rickshaw driver told CNN he’d been getting fewer passengers, as people opted for air-conditioned taxis over open-air transport. “My body can’t take it, but I have to keep cycling,” said Sagar Mandal, 39. “We are used to physical labor, we aren’t complaining about that. But this heat is not normal, something has to change.” Indonesia’s capital Jakarta saw one of the biggest jumps in the number of days over 35 degrees Celsius in the past 30 years, from 28 days between 1994 to 2003 to 167 days from 2014 to 2023. Seoul, South Korea and Beijing, China have also experienced significant rises in extremely hot days. In 2018, Seoul saw 21 days over 35 degrees Celsius — more than the previous 10 years combined. Beijing’s number of days over 35 degrees has increased by 309% since 1994. Cities are also seeing longer stretches of high temperatures, as governments fail to meet climate targets and sufficiently curb emissions. In October 2023, Jakarta experienced 30 consecutive days over 35 degrees Celsius — more days than during the entire period between 1994 and 2003. Extreme heat can be deadly, especially for vulnerable groups who may not have access to cool spaces. Between June 11 and 19, Delhi saw 192 heat wave-related deaths among its homeless population, a record high compared with the same period in the past five years, according to a report from the NGO Centre for Health Development India. Young children, the elderly and pregnant people are at higher risk during heat waves, which can also have a devastating impact on informal and hourly workers, who may face work stoppages or a choice between staying home unpaid or working in dangerous conditions. Heat also hurts economies, damaging crops and livestock and reducing labor productivity, especially in places without air conditioning, as workers require more breaks to rest and rehydrate. And extreme heat stresses infrastructure, including highways, roads, electrical wires and railways, causing supply chain disruptions and blackouts and disease. According to a 2022 Dartmouth College study, extreme heat has cost the global economy trillions of dollars since the early 1990s, with the world’s poorest and lowest-emitting countries bearing the brunt of the impact. “Responding to the challenge of extreme heat will require bold action from policymakers, including serious investment to adapt to this new reality,” said Landesman, from the IIED. “For many cities, it’s not a lack of knowledge or capacity or resources that’s preventing large-scale action to address climate change, rather it’s a lack of political will and governing tools.” CNN’s Esha Mitra and Kathleen Magramo contributed reporting."

And I say that the thing that’s an existential threat is not global warming, where the ocean will rise – maybe, it may go down, also – but it may rise one eighth of an inch in the next 497 years, they say. One eighth.” He added what appeared to be a joke: “Which gives you a little bit more waterfront property if you’re lucky enough though.” Facts First: Trump’s claim about the expected pace of sea level rise is not even close to correct. The global average sea level is currently risi﻿ng more per year than Trump claimed that people say it will rise “in the next 497 years.” NASA reported in March that the current global average sea level rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches per year, more than double the rate in 1993. And a World Meteorological Organization report this year said the rate of sea level rise between 2014 and 2023 was about 0.19 inches per year. In other words, sea level rise is already more than an eighth of an inch annually – and it is accelerating. NASA found a jump of 0.3 inches between 2022 and 2023. Gary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary sciences who studies sea level rise, said last year that Trump’s similar claims “can only be described as totally out of touch with reality” and that Trump “has no idea what he is talking about.” Sea levels rise by different amounts in different locations. For the US, sea levels are expected to rise particularly fast for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast – and Trump’s state of Florida, which is bordered by both of those coasts, is expected to be affected more severely than many other coastal states. In fact, Trump’s claims about sea levels are highly inaccurate for the area near Mar-a-Lago, which is on the Atlantic. Griggs noted in a June email that data from the closest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge to Mar-a-Lago shows an increase of an eighth of an inch roughly every nine months. Trump has made similar claims since his last presidential campaign - sometimes saying the estimate is an eighth of an inch increase over 200, 250, 300 or 400 years. Trump has also previously made the joke about rising seas creating more waterfront property. In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland – rendering some communities uninhabitable and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of flooding, making hurricanes more destructive, and damaging infrastructure and ecosystems."

","Billy Stockwell, CNN","Growing up in Texas, Mary Beth Walsh thought she was accustomed to high temperatures. Her hometown of Dallas, which is currently being blasted by unrelenting heat, frequently experiences heat waves. But when the 21-year-old visited Athens in mid-June with her friends she was shocked by the “unbearable” 98 Fahrenheit (37 Celsius) heat she faced. “I actually had no idea about the heat that was going on until we were there, which was pretty surprising,” she told CNN. “I always joke around that I have such a high heat tolerance; I bring my sweatshirt with me to class in August (in the US),” she said. But the apartment she was staying in had no air conditioning and temperatures were too high during the day to explore the city on foot. “Our energy levels were lower than we thought they would be,” she said. “It felt pretty unbearable to walk in the direct heat.” Climate crisis-driven sweltering summers in Europe are now a reality that many tourists are waking up to. Interest in visiting hotter Mediterranean countries dropped in 2023 amid record heatwaves and wildfires, with more temperate destinations becoming increasingly popular, experts say. Recent heat-fueled deaths and disappearances in Greece, including that of the British TV personality Michael Mosley, have the potential to further fuel this northward shift, as incidents of extreme heat influence vacation decisions. The degree to which the travel industry and tourists alike can adapt to the rising tide of climate impacts is becoming a bigger issue for countries in southern Europe, many of which rely on tourism to boost their economies. The recent high temperatures have brought the climate crisis into sharp focus for some European vacationers. “The climate crisis that we’ve been fearing will happen in 10 or 15 years is already here in some parts of the world. That’s the scary part,” Roo Clark, 28, from Suffolk in eastern England, who is currently staying with his girlfriend on the Greek island of Skyros, told CNN. “Five years ago, me and my friends wouldn’t have even spoken about it (climate change), whereas now it’s more of a conversation.” Authorities in Greece have repeatedly warned tourists not to underestimate the intense heat, especially during the middle of the day. Hiking in high temperatures has been a common thread linking recent deaths in the country. Temperatures in Greece are forecast to be between 90 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit (low- to mid-30s in Celsius) over the next couple of weeks, a few degrees above summer average, according to CNN meteorologists, except for one to two days when rain is forecast, which will keep temperatures down. Stefanos Sidiropoulos, who runs Greece’s largest travel agency specializing in outdoor activities, said tourists shouldn’t jump straight into activities. “People that are coming from north Europe, or from Canada, places with colder temperatures, it’s more difficult for them. They need time to adapt to these conditions,” he told CNN. Sidiropoulos’ travel agency, Trekking Hellas, now offers some activities when temperatures are lower, such as during sunrise and sunset hours. “Or at night, with torches,” he adds. Climate change’s influence on where tourists are taking their vacations will have serious repercussions for some countries dependent on income from travelers. In Greece, tourism contributes nearly 38 billion euros ($41 billion) - around 20% of the country’s entire economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. In Italy, where level three heat alerts — the highest warning —have recently been issued for the cities of Rome, Perugia and Palermo, tourism represents 10% of the country’s economy, according to the latest figures, with one in every eight jobs linked to the industry. Following Europe’s 2023 summer heat wave, which saw thousands flee from wildfires on the Greek island of Rhodes, there was a 7% rise in expression of concerns about climate change among European travelers, according to the European Travel Commission (ETC), a nonprofit association responsible for the promotion of Europe as a travel destination. This followed a decline in interest in southern Mediterranean vacation locations between the summers of 2022 and 2023, with cooler destinations like the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Denmark becoming more appealing, ETC told CNN. “Travelers are increasingly aware of extreme weather events and their potential impact on their vacations,” Eduardo Santander, CEO of ETC, told CNN, adding that in the future this could cause more travelers to visit southern Europe during spring and late fall instead of during the hotter summer months. For now, Santander said that tourist concerns about climate change tend to be relatively short-lived. “Travelers are concerned after the summer but tend to forget about those events when booking their next holidays in spring,” he said. Extreme heat is one consequence of climate change impacting tourist hot spots across Europe. But there are others. Warmer conditions caused by climate change are pushing populations of disease-transmitting mosquitoes into new areas of Europe, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Clark, the tourist currently staying on Skyros, said that the number of mosquitoes was very high during the heat wave in early June. “We were absolutely riddled with bites. There was no wind and even though we sprayed ourselves they still found a way,” Clark told CNN. “It was definitely the low winds and high temperatures that was causing it.” One key species of mosquito that can spread dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, called Aedes albopictus, is now established in many European countries, including Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, according to ECDC. Andrea Ammon, ECDC director, said travel can contribute to the expansion of the species’ reach. “Increased international travel from dengue-endemic countries will also increase the risk of imported cases,” she said in a statement. Last year, ECDC recorded 130 locally acquired cases of dengue in Europe, up from 71 cases in 2022. There have been no locally acquired dengue cases reported in Europe so far this summer, ECDC told CNN, but based on previous summer trends they expect the first cases to be reported in the coming weeks. One human case of West Nile virus infection, spread by the native Culex pipiens mosquito, was reported in Spain’s Seville province in March, according to ECDC. Last year, the organization recorded 713 locally acquired human cases of West Nile virus infection in nine EU countries, resulting in 67 deaths. Last summer’s record-breaking temperatures across the globe were driven by a mix of human-caused climate change and the return of the natural , El Niño phenomenon, which brings warmer global temperatures. This combination raised temperatures to record levels in parts of Europe, the planet’s fastest- warming continent. But even as the impact of El Niño reduces, experts say that the long-term trend of global warming will continue. “Climate change is tilting the odds in favor of more extreme events happening more frequently, and then becoming more severe,” Rebecca Carter, director of climate adaptation and resilience at the World Resources Institute, told CNN. She added that high tourist numbers in some regions of Europe were putting already hard-pressed local authorities under pressure, as they juggle the need to keep residents safe from high heat as well as protecting visitors. Carter said that the travel industry needs to consider climate adaptation. “It’s something I don’t think the travel industry is thinking about as much as it should,” she said, adding that booking rules could be made more flexible for flights and hotels, for example. “When people plan these trips, it’s weeks or months in advance and you can’t predict when a specific place is going to have extreme heat.” Some tourists, such as parents whose children are at school, have less flexibility when deciding travel plans, Carter said. In these circumstances, she said planning was key: “What would you do if there was an extreme heat wave, and the power was out? Can you map out in advance where you would go for help?” Sidiropoulos from Trekking Hellas agreed that forward planning was important, but he was keen for visitors to still get out and enjoy the beauty of Greece’s culture and natural world. “I always say to people who are travelling, ‘don’t stay in your hotel and just do the classic things like go to a restaurant,’” he said. “You have the opportunity to see nature … and to see the authentic side of our country.”"

But temperatures for two large sections of the country are expected to far exceed those typical of early July. Heat will ramp up in parts of the West and southern US this week, culminating in temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal in California and Oregon on Thursday and 5 to 10 degrees above normal from Texas and Oklahoma to the Carolinas. High temperatures in the 100s and 110s will hit parts of California’s Central Valley while desert areas in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will approach 115 degrees. Sacramento — which just experienced its fourth-hottest June on record — could come close to its hottest Fourth of July with a high near 107 degrees Thursday. Las Vegas could come within a couple degrees of its hottest-ever Independence Day when the mercury tops out around 112. Heat has been relentless for the city — this June was also its hottest on record. While Thursday won’t be record-hot for Phoenix, temperatures in the city are expected to climb around 7 degrees above its normal high of about 107. Thursday is also likely to be the third day in a row where temperatures exceed the 110 degree mark for the city — a streak that will continue into next week. Thursday will be very hot for parts of the West but even higher temperatures are expected to follow. Brutal heat will expand into much of the Pacific Northwest on Friday and keep temperatures sky-high across California and the desert Southwest. Portland, Oregon, will swelter as temperatures climb into the mid-90s Thursday and soar to near 100 degrees on Friday — about 25 degrees hotter than normal. The South will also bake Thursday, but it won’t quite reach the extremes the West will endure. High temperatures in the 90s will be widespread in the Southern states, with parts of Texas and Oklahoma set to reach into the low 100s. Dallas will climb to around 101 degrees Thursday, likely marking the fourth day in a row of the thermometer hitting triple digits. Typically, the metro should have a high of around 94 for Independence Day. Farther east, Atlanta should normally top out at around 88 degrees on the Fourth of July, but the city is expected to reach 94 degrees this time around. The heat comes after the city recorded 11 days in a row of temperatures at or above 90 degrees to the end of June and recorded its first 100 degree reading in nearly five years. Humidity will make the heat feel even worse in the South, sending heat index values — how hot the air actually feels to the body — over 100 degrees for millions. Dangerous heat index values coupled with outdoor activity for the holiday could result in heat-related illnesses without the proper precautions. In addition to the heat, Mother Nature will also provide her own Fourth of July fireworks. Thunderstorms will rumble over portions of the Mississippi Valley and Midwest from the morning hours onward as a cold front digs southward across the regions. Thunderstorms are also possible from parts of the Ohio Valley to the Northeast. As the day progresses, some severe thunderstorms are possible, mainly in parts of Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas during the afternoon and evening. These storms could unload damaging wind gusts, hail, heavy rain and even a tornado or two. Any storms that linger into the evening hours could disrupt fireworks displays.

The only way to minimize the damage is to rapidly deploy clean energy on a massive scale by the end of this decade, scientists and global energy groups say. Instead, Trump is poised to sprint in the opposite direction. “He has said he’s going to come back with a vengeance,” former US special climate envoy John Kerry told CNN. “It would really be just a catastrophic outcome.” This vision of the future is based on interviews with more than a dozen people: industry analysts, public officials and insiders from the former Trump administration, some of whom are involved in Project 2025, a conservative strategy guide to reshape the federal government in the event of a Trump win. But it’s also based on what Trump has said himself. He has railed against Biden’s climate policies at rallies and derided clean energy, vowing to push America back to fossil fuels. He has openly courted the oil industry at fundraising events, the Washington Post reported, promising regulation rollbacks in exchange for campaign cash. “No one has done more damage to the American oil and gas industry than Joe Biden,” Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement. Leavitt said if Trump were elected, he would give the oil industry “more freedom,” describing the planet-warming fossil fuel as “liquid gold” and (falsely) as “clean energy.” “He will do that again as soon as he gets back to the White House,” she added. While his first term was characterized by policy chaos often stymied by courts, Trump’s second term would be efficient, former Trump administration officials told CNN. “We lost a fair amount of time early in the Trump administration because we weren’t as prepared as we would be for round two,” Mandy Gunasekara, former chief of staff of the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump, told CNN. The lesson learned, she said, is to move with speed. Trump’s circle of influence is more organized this time, focused on gutting key agencies that oversee environmental protection and unwinding most, if not all, of Biden’s marquee climate rules. It could happen “very fast,” said David Bernhardt, who served as Interior Secretary in the Trump administration. Bernhardt, who is not involved with Trump’s campaign, speculated the former president “would essentially be directing, in many cases, a step back to policies that he implemented in the past,” adding the rollbacks could be done “in a matter of months, in many instances.” While Biden is cementing a legacy as the most pro-climate president, Trump would work to unravel the progress, focusing instead on America’s fossil fuel “energy dominance,” several people told CNN. Trump’s second-term energy policies could be summed up by three words he chants at his rallies, popularized by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin 16 years ago: “Drill, baby, drill.” Gas-powered cars and trucks account for the biggest chunk of the country’s climate pollution, and one of Biden’s biggest climate and economic policies is his push toward electric vehicles. Democrats passed tax credits to help consumers defray the cost of an EV, and Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency finalized tailpipe rules that push the auto market toward fuel-efficient hybrids and EVs by the early 2030s. Trump and Republicans have seized on those actions as a “mandate” for EVs, which Trump has referred to as “all-electric nonsense where the cars don’t go too far” and a “bloodbath” for American jobs. Trump has promised to undo the tailpipe rules if he is elected, though unwinding them could take months. There are other ways Trump could delay the transition to EVs – some of which would hit voters’ pocketbooks. His Treasury Department could slash the tax credits for purchasing EVs. Former Trump Department of Transportation official Diana Furchtgott-Roth, now at the Heritage Foundation, said the second Trump administration would likely also again try to roll back the federal waiver that allows California to set its own car pollution rules. California Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN his state will continue “maintaining that leadership” regardless of whether Trump is elected president. “I don’t care what Trump says or does,” Newsom said. “We’re going to be that anchor, regardless of the prevailing winds in Washington, DC.” But there are some winds of change that Trump will likely need to bend to. Unlike the oil and gas industry – which is staunchly opposed to many of Biden’s climate policies, the auto industry is charging ahead with electric vehicles and wants to keep consumer subsidies to help drivers buy them. John Bozzella, president and CEO of auto industry trade group Alliance for Automotive Innovation, told CNN he didn’t think repeal of tax credits or the Biden administration’s emissions rules was a “foregone conclusion.” In a statement to CNN, Bozzella pointed to fast growth in EV sales and US factories to build them. “Things have changed quite a bit,” Bozzella said. “We’re moving decisively toward an electric future while providing customers a range of vehicle choices … but it’s important for America’s global competitiveness and our overall economic and national security that we stay on this path. That’s something both sides understand.” Biden and Trump both argue their energy policies would lower consumer costs and create jobs. But they offer vastly different visions on how to do it. Many of Trump’s energy policies revolve around a simple idea: drill for more US oil to bring down gas prices. The former president has vowed to unleash a torrent of US oil. “Drill, drill, drill,” Trump said on Fox News in February. At times, he’s falsely suggested drilling alone will halve inflation and energy prices. Energy analysts frequently point out this idea is a fallacy, because the price US drivers pay for gas is highly dependent on the global oil market. Whether the country is in a drilling boom is governed by “what the price of crude oil is, how healthy the economy is,” Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, and a former George W. Bush White House official, told CNN. “These things are outside of a president’s direct control.” The US is already awash in oil; it’s producing more crude than any other country in history and has led the world in oil production for the past six years. To the dismay of climate activists, crude oil production hit record highs under Biden, and new records are likely to be set this year and next year, according to the US Energy Information Administration. But Biden has dramatically curtailed the federal land and waters the fossil fuel industry can drill on. Last year, the administration openly touted the fact it was offering the smallest number of offshore oil and gas leases in history – just three over the next five years. The oil industry isn’t happy with that, and Trump is capitalizing on it, fiercely courting the oil industry in private fundraisers, promising to dramatically increase the amount of federal lands and waters for drilling. “A critical component of his plan is expanding access, and we did that in the Trump administration, whether it was the leasing of ANWR, expanding regular lease sales,” Bernhardt, the former Trump Interior Secretary, said. “Those are the types of things I think you would almost certainly see come back. By coming into office with a pro-oil agenda, would Trump be able to meaningfully increase US oil production? “No,” said McNally. Trump’s biggest impact would be “removing the risk of negative policy, rather than implementing policy that is going to measurably increase production,” McNally added. Trump could gut some of Biden’s pollution rules, but he’ll have a much harder time killing Biden’s biggest clean energy policy – a sweeping climate law even Trump’s own party is benefitting from. The Inflation Reduction Act, which contained the largest climate investment in US history, has spurred a deluge of clean energy projects and jobs in Republican congressional districts. CNN recently reported the vast majority of the $346-billion-worth of announced investments – nearly 78% – has gone to Republican congressional districts. “The IRA is much stickier,” said Nate Hultman, director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland and a former senior advisor to the State Department. “It’s much more deep-rooted than regulatory actions.” And while the oil industry wants some IRA provisions gone – like a program that would eventually fine oil producers for large methane leaks – it is supportive of some of the law’s tax credits for hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture. What experts are more concerned about is the damage Trump could inflict again on US leadership on the global stage. The Project 2025 document from the Heritage Foundation recommends Trump should fully exit the United Nations treaty to confront climate change – a decision that would rock international climate negotiations and make it harder for a future Democratic administration to re-enter. A senior Trump adviser told CNN there haven’t been any serious discussions inside the campaign over whether Trump would go so far as to pull the US out of the treaty. The campaign has also sought to distance itself from outside groups like Project 2025, stating that no policy is official unless it is coming from Trump or his campaign team. Kerry, who led America’s climate delegation on the world stage for years, called the possibility “disastrous” and “very destructive to the overall process,” adding it could spur other countries to abandon their climate goals at a critical time. If Trump makes good on that idea, “we’re in real, much deeper trouble than the challenges we already face,” Kerry said. CNN’s Alayna Treene, Bill Weir and Julian Quinones contributed to this report."

","Ashley Killough and Ed Lavandera, CNN","Katherine Benally sat between two open windows in her small home and looked out over a sun-baked field in the Chuska Mountain foothills of the vast Navajo Nation. As she waited for the cooling cross breeze, the 74-year-old recalled fondly the days when her family grew squash, corn and pumpkin on this property. They sought shade under its trees and had no need for electricity or other modern conveniences. “The weather,” she said, “it wasn’t that hot.” But that’s all changed: The Navajo Nation last year declared an extreme heat emergency as temperatures hit well above 110 degrees in parts of the region. And the heat just keeps coming. These days, Benally barely steps outside her home. What she wants is to go outdoors more often, then return to the cool kiss of air conditioning. “That would be perfect,” she said, smiling. But Benally – like 13,000 families in roughly a third of Navajo Nation households – is still off the electrical grid. Like many here, she uses solar panels to power essentials, such as a small refrigerator and a couple of light bulbs. But the power doesn’t last all day. Now, as global temperatures keep rising, the rush to fully electrify one of the poorest regions in the United States is more urgent than ever. To that end, several power poles laid flat this month on Benally’s land, waiting to be installed so she can connect to the power grid for the first time. Thanks to a non-profit initiative called Light Up Navajo, 46 utility companies from 16 states are partnering this year with the Navajo Nation’s utility authority to build dozens of miles of power lines under the same kind of mutual aid pacts that help restore power after natural disasters. It’s no easy task in an area known for its rugged terrain and arid climate. But it’s ever more critical to the health and safety of a community that traces its roots in the American Southwest back at least 800 years. “It’s crazy that this still happens in America,” said Bryan English, a crew foreman with Trico Electric Cooperative in Arizona who’s working his second year in a row on the project. Connecting a home a mile from Benally’s, English wiped sweat from his brow: “I don’t think any part of America shouldn’t have electricity in 2024.” Roughly the size of West Virginia, the Navajo Nation long has been rich with energy sources and production. But while private companies tapped those resources in the 20th century to help electrify areas around the Southwest, the Navajo Nation reaped few benefits. “It’s a fairly unique rural situation,” said Dave Lock with the Grand Canyon State Electric Cooperative Association. “A hundred years ago, when the rural electrification effort came into focus, a lot of rural areas across the country were like Navajo Nation: It wasn’t profitable for the for-profit utilities to go out and bring them power because of the long distances.” That changed under President Franklin Roosevelt’s administration in the 1930s, when farmers banded together to create rural co-ops to power remote parts of the country, using federal loans under the Rural Electrification Act. But many Native American nations at the time were still trying to assimilate and fell behind in the electrification efforts, according to a 2023 US Energy Department report to Congress. The non-profit Navajo Tribal Utility Authority started up in 1959 to help rectify the issue, but a complex myriad of political and geographical obstacles have made it more difficult to get the nation fully on the grid. Among the hurdles, the federal government put a 40-year development ban – known as the Bennett Freeze – across roughly 1.5 million acres of Navajo land to settle a dispute between the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. The ban, lifted in 2009, barred installation of electricity and other key infrastructure. The slow, steady slog to connect households to the power grid is expensive. Today, it costs the Navajo Nation $40,000 per family, largely due to the remote, desert land. It’s a massive financial challenge in an area where the average annual household income is just over $30,000, less than half the national rate. Without help from projects like Light Up Navajo, it could cost close to $1 billion to extend electricity to all 13,000 families, tribal utility authorities estimate. That astronomical sum – including hundreds of millions of dollars for transmission lines, electric substations and house wiring – is a huge reason other cooperatives have decided to help, their representatives said. In 2019, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority partnered with the American Public Power Association, a non-profit industry lobbying group, to create Light Up Navajo, which so far has connected almost 850 families. But even with help from utilities across the country and groups like the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, another trade group, it could take three more decades to run power to every household. The partnership relies on a mix of private and federal funding. Workers come out for a 13-week stretch each spring and summer to set up the connections, while the tribal utility authority works year-round to get the homes shovel-ready. The task is “far from over,” said Deenise Becenti, the tribal utility authority’s government and public affairs manager. But when companies volunteer manpower and services, it makes the overall mission feel within reach. “If it weren’t for Light Up Navajo,” she said, “some of the families who’ve already received electricity would still be on the waiting list for years to come.” Living without connected electricity had been a way of life for so many in the Navajo Nation. But with the climate changing and technology advancing, many families are signing up to get on the Light Up Navajo waiting list. Without a grid connection, residents use their vehicles to charge cell phones or get a brief taste of air conditioning. One young family in Crystal, New Mexico, with a 2-year-old and a baby on the way picks up fresh produce and meat daily from a store 45 minutes away, then cooks dinner over a campfire before the sun goes down, they said. They don’t have a working refrigerator. Many families use camp-style coolers to store food, but those need constant supplies of ice, which quickly melts. Thirty miles south, Arlene Henry, 56, lives on a small compound with her sisters, children and grandchildren. She planted a tree, hoping to land at least a sliver of shade on their property, but insects thwarted its potential. “We’re looking for shade all the time,” Henry said. Her family sits outside in the afternoons and seeks relief in the shadow of her home, moving seats around the house to hide from the roving sun. “We sometimes bring ice, but it just melts right then and there.” Solar panels power the family’s refrigerator, two light bulbs and the flashlights they use to get to their outhouse at night. More than anything, Henry worries about her adult son, who relies on supplemental oxygen and has trouble keeping the tank powered full-time, she said. In 90-degree heat, she recently eyed her 2-year-old granddaughter riding around on a red tricycle. The little girl enjoyed an ice pop. But after a few minutes, Henry urged her to come back to the shade. “Come this way, baby, come this way,” she said. “It’s too hot over there.” Henry clutched some framed photos of her parents and grandparents who grew up on this land and passed it down to her and her sisters. But now, the lack of electricity scares her – though she also doesn’t want to leave this place that means so much. “I thought it was normal,” she said of growing up without electricity. “But now it’s getting to me.” So far this summer, Light Up Navajo has connected 125 homes with 38 miles of power lines built and a goal of connecting 25 more homes by the end of July, when the rainy season starts. William Lee Tom Jr., 56, benefited from one of those new connections this summer. He’s lived the past 15 years without electricity near Window Rock, Arizona, and didn’t want to leave because he can afford this house and it’s close to his family. Before the power hookup, Tom and his son often slept outside in his truck or in a wooden, tent-like structure when it got too hot. Once, while out on errands, his son had to go to the hospital due to dehydration, Tom said. “A lot of times, it’s just unbearable,” he said. Power line workers with Light Up Navajo recently installed poles at Tom’s property, and on June 13, they strung up the final wires to electrify his house. The crew wore long-sleeved work shirts and white hard hats, with cloth covers draping from the back to protect their necks from the scorching sun. After a lineman flipped a few switches on a new breaker box, Tom walked inside and turned on his only light bulb – one he’d just bought and installed an hour earlier. The dark room now had light, but it was the normally reserved mechanic’s face that lit up even more. Surprised it actually worked, Tom let out a triumphant “Alriiiiight!” He paused to look around the room, joking he could now see its messy contents. “Wow, that’s neat,” Tom added. “I’ve seen electricity before but not in my own property.” Now, he looks forward to installing an air conditioning unit."

Here’s why your AC can’t save you anymore,07/04/2024,"                                                 The combination of a hurricane, heat wave and a multi-day blackout is a nightmare scenario, but it’s one that is set to become more common as humans continue to warm the planet.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","When Hurricane Ida battered Louisiana with catastrophic flooding and powerful winds in August 2021, more than 1 million people lost power. Then came the heat wave. Temperatures rose above 90 degrees Fahrenheit — a sucker punch to those sweltering in their homes, unable to turn on air conditioning as power outages stretched on for days. It was the heat that proved deadliest in New Orleans, responsible for at least nine of the city’s 14 hurricane-related deaths. The combination of a hurricane, heat wave and a multi-day power outage is a nightmare scenario, but it’s one set to become more common as humans continue to warm the planet, fueling devastating extreme weather. And it reveals an uncomfortable truth about the vulnerability of humanity’s ultimate protection against heat: Air conditioning. Air conditioning is far from perfect. It gobbles up energy, most of which still comes from planet-heating fossil fuels, meaning it exacerbates the very problem it’s used to mitigate. Plus, it’s only available to those who can afford it, further widening social inequality. But it is also a lifeline against increasingly brutal heat, the deadliest type of extreme weather. It allows people to live in places where temperatures push close to the limits of survivability and where extreme heat persists even at night. Demand for AC is exploding, expected to triple worldwide by 2050, as global temperatures soar and incomes grow. The problem is, without electricity, access to air conditioning is lost. And many electrical  grids are being pushed to a breaking point due to increasingly frequent extreme weather and soaring demand for cooling. Weather accounted for 80% of major power outages across the US between 2000 and 2023, according to a report from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group. “Every aspect of weather is beating on the already vulnerable grid and really giving it a test,” said Jen Brady, a senior data analyst at Climate Central. In the US, the aging grid was designed “for the weather of the past, rather than the weather of the future,” said Michael Webber, a professor in mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. The main threat is storms, which can bring down transmission wires and poles. But heat, too, is having an impact. If it’s really hot, the system works less efficiently. Webber compares it to how someone might feel running a marathon in the heat — “we just kind of break down.” The grid can also buckle under the weight of demand as everyone cranks up their AC at the same time to cope with high temperatures. The number of major outages in the US — affecting more than 50,000 customers and lasting at least an hour — doubled between 2017 and 2020, said Brian Stone Jr., a professor specializing in urban environmental planning and design at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “Most of the increase is happening during the summer months, that tells me that these systems are not resilient,” he told CNN. Surging demand for cooling during an August 2020 heat wave in California prompted the state’s main grid operator to cut power to hundreds of thousands of homes in rolling blackouts for the first time in 20 years. In 2021, during the blistering heat wave that scorched the Pacific Northwest, power equipment buckled in the heat, triggering rolling blackouts for tens of thousands as temperatures soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It is not just the US that is struggling. In June, when temperatures in southern Europe topped 104 degrees Fahrenheit, parts of Albania, Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro experienced hours-long blackouts as demand for electricity spiked. Even short power outages can be dangerous. “If the grid goes out while there’s a heat wave, it goes from uncomfortable to deadly pretty quickly,” Webber said. Heat can affect vital organs and cause heat exhaustion, heat stroke and even death. If the power goes out when it’s very cold, people can add layers, make fires and huddle together. “If it gets really hot, there’s only one way to cool, and that is with electricity,” Webber said. The combination of a heat wave and power outages “is the most deadly climate-related event we can imagine,” said Stone. He and a team of scientists explored the potential impacts of a heat wave coinciding with a multi-day outage caused by extreme weather or a cyberattack. Focusing on Atlanta, Detroit and Phoenix, they looked at exposure inside people’s homes, a major driver of heat-related illness during a power outage. The figures were particularly stark for Phoenix. During a three to four-day heat event and  outage, half the city’s population — nearly 800,000 people — would require hospital treatment for heat-related illnesses, according to the findings. More than 13,000 would die. A power outage in Phoenix causes a “very dramatic shift in heat illness,” Stone said, because the city’s climate is so extreme and people struggle to adapt. In an unfortunate irony, widespread air conditioning may actually make residents less resilient because they are so acclimatized to cooling in their homes and workplaces, Stone said. Authorities in Phoenix say the city is well prepared. Kate Gallego, the city’s mayor, said Stone’s research was based on an extremely unlikely scenario. “The study does not account for any of the existing emergency response plans in place, or the fact that our electric grid consistently ranks among the most reliable in the country,” Gallego told CNN. Arizona Public Service, one of the energy companies providing power in Phoenix, said it has robust plans in place to prevent large-scale interruptions and regularly maintains the grid. But while the chances of a combined multi-day power outage and heat wave in Phoenix may be low, Stone said, it’s still possible and becoming more likely as the climate crisis worsens. Drastically cutting planet-heating pollution is the best long-term defense against heat and extreme weather, but the world is already committed to several decades of rising temperatures, Stone said. In the shorter-term, there are ways to limit vulnerabilities. Making the grid more robust and resilient is one, Stone said. This includes repairs and upgrades that take into account the climate of the future. Expanding and modernizing the grid, including adding more power plants and ensuring a diverse range of energy sources, will help strengthen it too, Webber said. “But we also need to acknowledge that those grids will fail, and they are failing with greater rate of frequency, and so we need to have back-up plans,” Stone said. That means rethinking cities, where heat-trapping concrete, steel and asphalt have replaced trees. Designing urban areas to be greener and cooler “can really increase grid resilience without investing in the grid itself,” he said. Climate Central’s Brady pointed to community solar projects, which can keep local power  on when the grid goes down. Babcock Ranch in Florida — “America’s first solar-powered town” — managed to keep the lights on in 2022 when Hurricane Ian barreled through, unlike nearby towns. Making homes more efficient will also help, Webber said. Homes better adapted to extreme weather can help reduce electricity demand when temperatures soar. Ultimately, “we’re vulnerable because we’ve built our lives around conditioned air,” Webber said, living in places where life would be impossible without it. The stress extreme weather is putting on the grid shows “climate change is here and we need to be dealing with it.”"

","Nouran Salahieh, Gene Norman and Monica Garrett, CNN","An extremely dangerous, unusually long heat wave is intensifying and spreading up the West Coast – and there will be no relief for days. California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Arizona are bracing for potential wildfires, opening cooling centers and warning residents to stay indoors and keep hydrated as the unrelenting heat wave delivers sweltering temperatures well into the 100s and 110s – with highs in the 120s possible in the Desert Southwest. And it’s only getting hotter. Death Valley, California, could top 125 degrees by Sunday or Monday, setting a new daily record for those dates. Las Vegas, Nevada, could also exceed its all-time high temperature of 117 degrees Sunday or Monday. “Confidence is increasing that this potentially historic heatwave will last several days,” the National Weather Service in Portland warned, adding the risk of heat-related illness will increase significantly. Extreme heat is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the National Weather Service. In San Jose, California, a homeless man died Tuesday due to the extreme heat, Mayor Matt Mahan said. The man was 69, according to the mayor’s spokesperson, Tasha Dean, citing information from the Santa Clara Medical Examiner’s Office. The same day, a 10-year-old died in Arizona after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, the Phoenix Police Department said. “This is a DANGEROUS situation, especially for sensitive populations,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said, reminding residents to drink plenty of water, stay in the shade, wear light, loose fitting clothes and never leave anyone in a car. Saturday will likely be the hottest day in this prolonged heat wave. High temperatures in the 110s are becoming common across California, outside coastal areas and higher elevations, the National Weather Service said. “This level of heat throughout parts of the Mojave Desert and Sacramento/San Joaquin valleys of California could pose a risk to anyone if proper heat safety is not followed,” the weather service said. Nationwide, nearly 140 million people remain under heat alerts – mostly in Western states, where the heat wave is expected to last through the middle of next week. More than 70 million people will be under heat alerts in parts of 10 western states on Saturday. Parts of Oregon will experience triple digits Friday, and the heat could last up to five days with poor overnight relief, the National Weather Service in Portland said. A state of emergency was declared in Multnomah County, Oregon’s most populous county, for this weekend as temperatures were expected to climb. “I’m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend,” Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno said in a news release. “They’ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.” Bruno said the area has had few hot days so far this year, and residents’ bodies have not yet acclimated to the heat. A previous heat wave that scorched Oregon in 2021 left dozens of people dead. Power equipment buckled in the heat, triggering rolling blackouts for tens of thousands as temperatures soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. While this heat wave isn’t expected to be as intense as the 2021 scorcher, forecasters are concerned about its long duration, said Meteorologist Noah Alviz of the National Weather Service in Portland. “Getting into the upper 90s or even triple digits of 100 to 105 for four to five days – that is very unusual for this location,” Alviz told CNN. “The triple-digit heat will expand northward into the Pacific Northwest and parts of the central Great Basin, with widespread highs rising into the 90s and low 100s,” the National Weather Service said. “The duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week.” Intense heat is expected to persist for much of the West Coast into the weekend. Major to extreme heat risk, the highest two levels, are expected for much of California and the Southwest on Saturday and Sunday, meaning health effects of heat become more likely in anyone without adequate hydration or cooling. Over a dozen high-temperature records were either broken or tied on Thursday, including multiple California cities. Palmdale reached 110 degrees, and Madera hit 109 degrees. The extremely dangerous and potentially deadly heat baking parts of the US also set a few all-time record high temperatures in some locations Friday. Palm Springs, California, reached 124 degrees Friday afternoon, exceeding the previous all-time record high for the date of 123 degrees set in 2021. An all-time record high of 105 set in 2012 was also broken in Raleigh, North Carolina, where temperatures of 106 degrees were recorded Friday. Additional daily record highs set on Friday included: • 114 degrees: San Jacinto, California• 109 degrees: Medford, Oregon• 109 degrees: Campo, California Dozens of additional temperature records are expected to be tied or broken each of the next few days. The dangerous heat will expand into the Intermountain West and northern High Plains by next week. The extreme heat – combined with gusty winds and low humidity – means any wildfires that start will spread quickly through already parched vegetation. Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the area of the Thompson Fire, which has consumed more than 3,700 acres in California’s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday. The blaze, which was 55% contained by Friday afternoon local time, has forced thousands of people to evacuate and prompted more than 2,000 firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat in the Oroville area. The wildfire has injured 11 firefighters, including eight who were affected by heat-related illnesses, according to Chris Peterson, a spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection – also known as Cal Fire. Twenty-six structures have been destroyed by the blaze and more than 4,000 are under threat. The state’s been seeing an active fire season, with more than 145,000 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 7,812 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire. There are now nearly two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest, according to Cal Fire. “We’re seeing fires on the coast in San Diego, to the foothills in Butte,” Cal Fire Deputy Director Nick Schuler told CNN Wednesday. “Our firefighters are battling fires across California and often times on the line for more than 24 hours. It’s difficult conditions that they face.” A wildfire in California’s Mariposa County, the French Fire, injured three firefighters and destroyed four structures, according to Cal Fire. It also triggered evacuation orders Thursday night. The fire has burned more than 900 acres just northwest of the small community of Mariposa, outside Yosemite National Park, and is 20% contained as of Friday evening. More than 800 structures are under threat. “Firefighters continue to gain containment and cool hot spots throughout the fire,” CAL Fire said in an update on its incident page Friday. “Utility crews are working diligently to repair and replace damaged infrastructure.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the area of the Thompson Fire on Wednesday. The declaration cleared the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. And in central Washington state, fireworks sparked an active wildfire called the Balsam Root Fire early Friday morning, according to Wenatchee Valley Fire Department Chief Brian Brett. The fire is burning in Wenatchee, about 150 miles east of Seattle. The fire is currently around 250 acres and is 30% contained, Brett told CNN. A Level 3 Evacuation Alert is in effect for approximately 150 homes. Residents under this advisory are being told to leave immediately. The department had previously reminded residents “private fireworks are banned in most of Chelan and Douglas Counties.” Fireworks started an estimated 31,302 fires in 2022, according to the National Fire Protection Association. As the West swelters, oppressive heat and humidity will begin to shift eastward to the mid-Atlantic and Southeast for the end of the week. “Warm overnight conditions in the upper 70s and low 80s will offer little relief, leading to a dangerous situation for those without access to adequate cooling,” the National Weather Service said. New heat alerts are now posted in southeast Texas, extreme southern Florida and parts of the Southeast northward to the mid-Atlantic, where high temperatures will range between 95-105 degrees. Cities including Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Raleigh and Washington, DC, will be feeling the heat. The heat index values – how air feels to the human body – will range between 100 and 115 degrees in those areas. “A cold front entering the southern Plains is anticipated to offer cooler and below average temperatures to Oklahoma, much of northern/western Texas, and the Mid-South by Friday,” the weather service said. CNN’s Raja Razek, Dave Alsup, Taylor Romine, Cindy Von Quednow, Paradise Afshar, Cheri Mossburg, Amanda Musa and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report."

Heat was a contributing factor, officials said. Major to extreme heat risk, the highest 2 levels, are expected for much of California and the Southwest on Saturday and Sunday, meaning health impacts from heat become more likely in anyone without adequate hydration or cooling. Parts of Oregon will experience triple digits up to five days with poor overnight relief, the National Weather Service in Portland said Friday. A state of emergency was declared in Multnomah County, Oregon’s most populous county, for this weekend as temperatures were expected to climb. “I’m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend,” Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno said in a news release. “They’ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.” Bruno said the area has had few hot days so far this year, and residents’ bodies have not yet acclimated to the heat. Other areas of the West were experiencing unusual heat. Palm Springs, California, reached 124 degrees Friday afternoon, exceeding the previous all-time record high for the date of 123 degrees set in 2021. An all-time record high of 105 set in 2012 was broken in Raleigh, North Carolina, where temperatures of 106 degrees were recorded Friday. Additional daily record highs set Friday included: • 127 degrees: Death Valley, California• 114 degrees: San Jacinto, California• 109 degrees: Medford, Oregon• 109 degrees: Campo, California The weather service said more than 35 million people in the contiguous United States will see temperatures in excess of 100 degrees in the next seven days. The extreme heat – combined with gusty winds and low humidity – means any wildfires that start will spread quickly through already parched vegetation. Red flag warnings are in effect through Saturday night across the West, including in the area of the Thompson Fire, which has consumed more than 3,700 acres in California’s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday. The blaze, which was 71% contained by Saturday morning, has forced thousands of people to evacuate and prompted about 2,000 firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat and extremely dry conditions in the Oroville area. The wildfire has injured 11 firefighters, including eight who were affected by heat-related illnesses, according to Chris Peterson, a spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection – also known as Cal Fire. Twenty-six structures have been destroyed by the blaze and more than 450 are under threat. In Central California, four firefighters have been injured battling the 908-acre French Fire about 55 miles north of Fresno, according to Cal Fire. The blaze is 25% contained. “Challenges are immense. We’re dealing with the increased temperatures, very steep and remote terrain,” Cal Fire deputy director of communications Nick Schuler told CNN, adding “the ability for rapid growth from the amount of vegetation that’s across the state is a challenge.” The largest current fire in the state is on federal land, with the Basin Fire having consumed more than 14,000 acres. According to officials with Sierra National Forest, the fire is 46% contained and hasn’t grown much in the past day. The state’s been seeing an active fire season, with more than 150,000 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 8,674 acres burned by this time last year, according to Cal Fire. There are now nearly two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest where Cal Fire is the lead agency. California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the area of the Thompson Fire on Wednesday. The declaration cleared the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. As the West swelters, hazardous heat persists in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast and humidity will make it feel like up to 110 degrees at times. Heat advisories are in place from the beaches of Alabama and Florida all the way to upstate New York. “Take extra precautions when outside. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing,” the National Weather Service said. “Try to limit strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Take action when you see symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.” CNN’s Raja Razek, Dave Alsup, Taylor Romine, Cindy Von Quednow, Paradise Afshar, Cheri Mossburg, Amanda Musa and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report."

And nearly 40 million people in the contiguous US are forecast to see temperatures over 100 degrees over the next seven days. A slew of daily temperature records were broken this Fourth of July weekend. On Saturday, Death Valley reached 128 degrees, breaking the daily record of 127 set on July 6, 2007. Las Vegas reached 115 degrees, tying with records in 2007 and 1989. Kingman, Arizona, reached 109 degrees, breaking the previous record of 108. On Sunday, temperatures in Las Vegas hit 120 degrees for the first time in recorded history, according to preliminary data from the weather service. In more than 32,000 days of records, the temperature had never climbed above 117 degrees prior to Sunday. The city’s heat is not just a record for its peak temperature, but also for its longevity. Las Vegas temperatures have exceeded 110 degrees each day since July 3 and are forecast to do so every day until at least next Sunday. That will mark a stretch of prolonged extreme heat longer than any ever experienced in the city, with 11 days or more above 110 degrees. In California, Daggett broke its daily temperature record, reaching 117 degrees. Bishop reached 108 degrees, setting another record for the state. Several record highs were also set in the Sacramento area, including in Redding, where it reached 119 degrees and beat the all-time high temperature record of 118, according to the weather service in Sacramento. Extremely dangerous heat is expected to persist in the West, with excessive heat watches, warnings and heat advisories in effect for much of the region. Heat warnings are active in California and Nevada due to the increased risk of heat-related illnesses there. “Intense, widespread, and long duration heat building in the West will be extremely dangerous and potentially deadly if not taken seriously,” the weather service said. An excessive heat warning is in effect until late Wednesday evening for Death Valley, California, where temperatures are expected to be between 122 to 129 degrees. Elsewhere in the state, Owens Valley could reach 111 degrees, and Barstow could reach 118. In Nevada, Las Vegas and Pahrump could also reach 118 degrees. “Hot temperatures overnight will mean little relief from the daytime heat, especially in Las Vegas and Death Valley, where low temperatures may not fall below 90 degrees for several days,” the National Weather Service said. Death Valley – the driest national park in the US – could hit a sizzling 130 degrees by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service in Las Vegas. For people without adequate cooling and hydration, the multi-day nature of the heat and record warm overnight temperatures could cause heat stress to build. Extreme heat is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the weather service. Oregon and Washington have both also seen record heat and temperatures are expected to remain in the triple digits through early next week. “Look for more records to fall in the coming days as temperatures in the inland valleys are likely to climb near or above 100 degrees each day through Tuesday, July 9,” the weather service in Portland said. Meanwhile, heat and humidity in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast is forecast to gradually subside into next week, lingering longest along the Gulf Coast and into the Carolinas, the weather service said. Heat index values approaching 110 degrees on Saturday in the mid-Atlantic region will be lowered to near 100 degrees on Sunday. Heat advisories currently stretch from upstate New York down the East Coast to Alabama. In the West, the heat wave is expected to expand into the Great Basin and eventually the northern High Plains into next week. It’s likely to remain into mid-July, according to the weather service. Intense heat, paired with dry windy conditions, is bringing a critical risk of wildfires to parts of the upper Great Basin toward the Four Corners for the rest of the weekend. Portions of southern Idaho and southern Utah are particularly at risk. Sweltering heat on the West Coast could continue to fuel large wildfires in California. More than 3,000 wildfires across the state have burned over 150,000 acres so far in 2024, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Cal Fire spokesperson Nick Schuler says triple-digit temperatures and critical fire weather conditions have proven to be a challenge for the more than 3,500 firefighters battling fires across the state. “Challenges are immense. We’re dealing with the increased temperatures, very steep and remote terrain,” Schuler told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield, adding “the ability for rapid growth from the amount of vegetation that’s across the state is a challenge.” The Basin Fire, which is the largest active wildfire in the state, burned over 14,000 acres in Fresno County and was 60% contained Saturday evening, according to the Cal Fire. Another large wildfire, the Lake Fire, ignited Friday afternoon in Santa Barbara County and has already scorched over 13,200 acres. The Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office issued evacuation warnings in nearby areas and several roads were closed. The Thompson Fire, for which California Gov. Gavin Newsom had issued an emergency declaration, was 79% contained as of Saturday night. After starting Tuesday, it has burned through nearly 4,000 acres in Butte County. Two firefighters were injured, 26 structures were destroyed and eight were damaged by the fire, according to Cal Fire. “Dangerously hot and dry conditions were observed across the incident,” according to Cal Fire. The French Fire in Mariposa County was 35% contained and had burned through over 900 acres after it started on the fourth of July. Due to the fire, evacuation orders and warnings were issued, four firefighters were injured and four structures were destroyed, according to Cal Fire. Meanwhile, the Mccain Fire in San Diego County had burned about 1,500 acres and was 95% contained. “We are happy to report that we are seeing an increase in the percentage of containment,” Schuler said. “We’re starting to lift some of the evacuation orders and warnings allowing people to start to cautiously make way back to their homes.” But crews still have to contend with several days ahead of continued heat, Schuler said."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/tractor-supply-dei-climate-lgbtq/index.html,Tractor Supply warned climate change and a lack of diversity would hurt business. Now it’s ignoring those risks,07/11/2024,"                                                 As recently as February, Tractor Supply Co., known for selling animal feed, pet food and lawn and garden equipment to hobby farmers, told investors that climate change was a significant threat to its business.                                             ","Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN","As recently as February, Tractor Supply Co., known for selling animal feed, pet food and lawn and garden equipment to hobby farmers, told investors that climate change was a significant threat to its business. Any delay or failure to meet its goals of cutting emissions 50% in six years and achieving net zero emissions by 2040 could hurt “public perception of our business, employee morale, customer or stockholder support” and its financial performance, the company said in its annual report. Tractor Supply also warned that it could suffer similar business consequences if it did not meet its five-year diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) plan to increase spending by 35% with diverse suppliers and boost representation of people of color at manager levels and above at the company by 50%. Hal Lawton, the chief executive of the Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, had said these initiatives “make great business sense for Tractor Supply.” But Tractor Supply has decided that all of those risks are now worth ignoring. The company announced last month that it will withdraw its carbon emission reduction goals and eliminate jobs and goals focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. It will also stop sponsoring LGBTQ+ Pride festivals and voting campaigns, as well as submitting data to the Human Rights Campaign, one of the biggest LGBTQ+ non-profit advocacy groups in the United States. By walking away from diversity and climate goals, Tractor Supply has become the latest corporate giant to retreat from progressive initiatives it once promoted, joining Bud Light, Target and others. Although the company’s changes have placated some customers, they have hurt its reputation with other customers and employees and could bring on the type of risks the brand recently warned about. Tractor Supply is “trying to thread the needle,” said Nooshin Warren, a professor of marketing at the University of Arizona who studies corporate activism and corporate political culture. “They’re trying to keep both sides happy, which usually never happens.” Tractor Supply, she noted, has become a more diverse company in recent years, and the company’s decision could alienate employees. Racial and ethnic minorities make up 18% of its approximately 50,000 employees and 33% of its board of directors, and it has earned strong ratings from the Human Rights Campaign for LGBTQ+ inclusive policies. Tractor Supply’s reversal came after Robby Starbuck, who in 2022 launched a failed bid for Tennessee’s 5th Congressional District and now hosts a podcast, waged a weeks-long campaign on X calling on customers to boycott Tractor Supply and contact its corporate leadership over the company’s LGBTQ+ and DEI hiring initiatives. “It’s time to expose Tractor Supply,” he first posted June 6, drawing attention to corporate components like “LGBTQIA+ events at work” and “a DEI council.” Other conservative political candidates, activists and customers began criticizing the company on social media, and said they would stop shopping at the chain. “We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them,” Tractor Supply said. “We have taken this feedback to heart.” “Going forward,” Tractor Supply said, “we will ensure our activities and giving tie directly to our business.” The company said that although it’s ending DEI goals and carbon emissions goals, it will still ensure a “respectful environment” and focus on land and water conservation efforts. But Tractor Supply’s reversal has already caused outcry. The National Black Farmers Association, a non-profit advocacy group representing 130,000 Black farmers and their families, has called for Lawton’s resignation and said the company has “little respect for (Black) farmers.” “They’re sending the wrong signal to America at the wrong time in history,” John Boyd, the president of the organization, told CNN. “America isn’t just white men. It’s made up a lot of different people. They have a lot of people they’re offending.” Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer who is a Tractor Supply shareholder and customer and buys feed, mineral blocks and fencing frequently from the chain, said many Black farmers rely on Tractor Supply for their suppliers. He feels the company “caved to hard right-wing nonsense” and plans to stop shopping at the chain. A Tractor Supply store manager in upstate New York who is gay resigned and told the town newspaper that the company “betrayed” employees and customers. Tractor Supply declined to comment on these statements. Tractor Supply has a broad customer base. The company has more than 2,400 stores in 49 states and targets recreational farmers, ranchers, animal and pet owners who primarily live in towns outside major metropolitan areas and in rural communities. Rural areas tend to be more politically conservative than urban areas. In 2020, Republican candidate Donald Trump won 65% of rural voters, according to Pew. But suburban areas are more politically divided — in 2020, Democratic candidate Joe Biden won 54% of suburban voters. Tractor Supply’s customer base has historically been primarily older men, who lean Republican, but Tractor Supply has increasingly tried to draw Millennials and women, who tend to favor Democrats. Since the pandemic, the company has gained ground with younger consumers who moved out of cities. “Customer demographic trends continue to trend younger and more female than pre-pandemic,” Lawton said last year. Tractor Supply’s reversal could hurt it with these customers, who could be crucial as the company’s historic base ages out of the market. “Tractor Supply Co. is turning its back on their own neighbors with this shortsighted decision,” Eric Bloem, vice president of Programs and Corporate Advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN in a statement Saturday. “LGBTQ+ people live in every zip code in this country, including rural communities. We are shoppers, farmers, veterans and agriculture students.” Squirrelwood Equine Sanctuary, a New York animal sanctuary that says it spends more than $65,000 annually at Tractor Supply, said it plans to stop shopping at the chain. “We never asked for a pride flag out front. We do expect respect and inclusion. You have lost our business and every shred of respect we might have had,” the non-profit said on X. Particularly after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, companies rolled out policies aimed at diversifying their workforces and welcoming customers from all backgrounds. But Tractor Supply’s reversal is part of a larger corporate retreat on DEI programs and environmental goals. Many of these efforts are now under attack from right-wing activists, businessmen such as Bill Ackman and Elon Musk, and others. The backlash also comes amid a wave of legislation in Republican-led states to curtail LGBTQ rights and cut DEI programs in colleges and universities, alongside lawsuits to stop 401(k) managers from considering climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when selecting investments. Right-wing groups have threatened boycotts against brands like Bud Light, Disney and Nike to roll back their inclusivity efforts. They’ve even gone after Chick-fil-A for its diversity programs and Cracker Barrel for selling plant-based sausages, brands traditionally seen as conservative. Last year, Bud Light’s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked an anti-trans backlash and a months-long boycott of the beer brand, throughout which the company failed to take a firm stance in support of Mulvaney and the transgender community. The boycott and the subsequent tepid response lost parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev as much as $1.4 billion in sales, as well as its credibility with a major LGBTQ+ non-profit. Last month, retailer Target said it will limit how many stores would carry its Pride-themed collection for adults after a boycott from right-wing activists last summer led to a sharp dip in sales. Many companies are “turning back,” said Nooshin Warren from the University of Arizona. “It seems that retracting is now the trend.” CNN’s Eva Rothenberg contributed to this article."

",Opinion by Jeff Goodell,"Editor’s Note: Jeff Goodell is a journalist and author of several books on climate change, most recently “The Heat Will Kill You First: Life and Death on a Scorched Planet.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion. Earlier this week, the Third Avenue Bridge in Manhattan had to be shut down because the bridge – which pivots to allow ships to pass – wouldn’t close correctly. Why? Because it was so hot in New York City that day the metal in the bridge swelled, and the closing mechanism wouldn’t work. Firefighters had to spray water on the structure for several hours to cool it off before the bridge could be reopened to traffic. A tragedy? Hardly. But it’s evidence of one of the central truths of our time, and one that is becoming more and more apparent every day: We have built our world for a climate that no longer exists. Consider Houston, the throne of Big Oil, where the electric grid has the same hub-and-spoke basic architecture as it did 100 years ago. This week, Hurricane Beryl knocked out power to more than 2 million homes. Yes, hurricanes are devastating. But less than two months earlier, a sudden windstorm in the city blacked out electricity for more than a million people. How many blackouts will it take before we realize today’s power grid was built for yesterday’s climate? Or consider the wildfires in California earlier this month. They occurred during a heatwave that broke many all-time temperature records in the West, including an astonishing 122 degrees Fahrenheit in Palm Springs. One consequence of this heat was that it was too hot for firefighters to fight the fires without risking heatstroke. If it were much hotter, water bombers and helicopters could not fly, radically diminishing firefighters’ ability to control the flames. Once you start to look, danger signs of Old World infrastructure are everywhere. The vast majority of buildings and homes in European cities like London, Paris and Madrid have no air conditioning. When an extreme heat wave hits, the people who live and work in them are increasingly vulnerable (one recent study published in Nature Medicine estimated there were more than 60,000 heat-related deaths in Europe during the summer of 2022). Reservoir dams around the world are stressed by extreme rainfall events. Airport tarmacs soften in the heat, causing flights cancellations. Sea walls that protect coastal cities from flooding are more and more ineffective as sea level rises and storm surges become more powerful. Cities are becoming human frying pans. In Phoenix this summer, surface temperatures on streets and sidewalks hit 160 degrees Fahrenheit – even a few seconds of contact could cause severe burns. And it’s not just infrastructure that is maladapted to our rapidly warming world. Our economic systems and cultural lives are out of sync, too. The Summer Olympics (and American football) become dangerous games in 100-degree heat. The insurance business was not structured to deal with permanent flooding from sea level rise. Religious pilgrimages, such as the Hajj in Saudi Arabia, during which more than 1,300 people died amid blistering temperatures last month, are not supposed to be essentially death marches. Big automakers like Toyota and GM, both of which have been slow to adapt to the EV revolution, risk sharing the fate of Kodak at the dawn of the digital age. Even Big Oil executives – the ones that I’ve talked to, anyway – know their days are numbered (which is why they are fighting so hard to derail or stall the clean energy revolution). It’s tempting to believe that we can adapt to all these changes with better technology. And it’s certainly true that better technology is a powerful force. One clear example: the incredible decline in the cost of renewable power in recent years. Twenty years ago, when I started writing about climate change, fossil fuel executives argued that we needed to keep burning fossil fuels because they were cheaper than renewable power, and access to cheap energy was important for economic development, especially in the Global South. Now, that economic paradigm has been reversed. In virtually every part of the world, electricity generated by renewable power is cheaper than electricity generated by fossil fuels. As a result, the amount of electricity created by wind, geothermal and especially solar is increasing fast. Here in Texas where I live – hardly a bastion of tree-huggers – as much as 70% of the power on the grid this year is coming from renewable sources. Despite this progress, the clean energy revolution is still happening too slowly to stop the rising heat and extreme weather we are experiencing. In fact, global oil and gas consumption hit an all-time high in 2023 – not surprisingly, so did the level of climate-warming CO2 emissions. Air conditioning is another example of the complexity of technological progress. When I talk with people about my book, “The Heat Will Kill You First: Life and Death on a Scorched Planet,” I often hear some version of this: Yeah, the heat can be brutal. Good thing we have air conditioning! AC is becoming a survival tool for many people in ever-hotter climates, but it is not a magic fix for a superheated world. More than 750 million people on the planet don’t even have access to electricity, much less AC. We are not going to air condition the ocean, which is full of mysterious and beautiful creatures which hundreds of millions of people depend on for sustenance. We are not going to air condition forests, which are key to maintaining biodiversity on Earth. We are not going to air-condition the fields where food crops are grown. Our dependence on AC, in fact, masks the true scope and scale of the challenges we face. In the end, addressing the climate crisis is not about building better technology. It’s much bigger than that. We need to rebuild our world. Fast-rising temperatures and more extreme weather are forcing us to rethink everything about how we live – where we get our energy, how we grow our food, how we build our cities, and, mostly importantly, who we vote for. The sooner we stop clinging to the old ways and focus on building a smarter, more sustainable, more equitable future for everyone, the better off we – and every living thing on this planet – will be. What has already been lost during the climate crisis is a tragedy.

","Laura Paddison, CNN","The impacts of human-caused climate change are so overwhelming they’re actually messing with time, according to new research. Polar ice melt caused by global warming is changing the speed of Earth’s rotation and increasing the length of each day, in a trend set to accelerate over this century as humans continue to pump out planet-heating pollution, according to the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The changes are small — a matter of milliseconds a day — but in our high-tech, hyperconnected world have an important impact on computing systems we have come to rely on, including GPS. It’s yet another sign of the huge impact humans are having on the planet. “This is a testament to the gravity of ongoing climate change,” said Surendra Adhikari, a geophysicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and a report author. The number of hours, minutes and seconds making up each day on Earth are dictated by the speed of the Earth’s rotation, which is influenced by a complex knot of factors. These include processes in the planet’s fluid core, the ongoing impact of the melting of huge glaciers after the last ice age, as well as melting polar ice due to climate change. For millennia, however, the impact of the moon has dominated, increasing the length of a day by a few milliseconds per century. The moon exerts a pull on Earth causing the oceans to bulge towards it, gradually slowing Earth’s rotation. Scientists have previously made connections between polar ice melt and longer days, but the new research suggests global warming is a bigger influence on time than recent studies have shown. In the past, the impact of climate change on time “has not been so dramatic,” said Benedikt Soja, a study author and assistant professor of space geodesy at the Swiss university ETH Zurich. But that could be changing. If the world continues to pump out planet-heating pollution, “climate change could become the new dominant factor,” outpacing the moon’s role, ﻿he told CNN. It works like this: As humans warm the world, glaciers and ice sheets are melting, and that meltwater is flowing from the poles toward the equator. This changes the planet’s shape — flattening it at the poles and making it bulge more in the middle — slowing its rotation. The process is often compared to a spinning ice skater. When the skater pulls their arms in towards their body, they spin faster. But if they move their arms outwards, away from their body, their spin slows. The team of international scientists looked at a 200-year period, between 1900 and 2100, using observational data and climate models to understand how climate change has affected day length in the past and to project its role in future. They found the impact of climate change on day length has increased significantly. Climate change-fueled sea level rise caused the length of a day to vary between 0.3 and 1 milliseconds in the 20th century. Over the past two decades, however, the scientists calculated an increase in day length of 1.33 milliseconds per century, “significantly higher than at any time in the 20th century,” according to the report. If planet-heating pollution continues to rise, warming the oceans and accelerating ice loss in Greenland and Antarctica, the rate of change is set to soar, the report found. If the world is unable to rein in emissions, climate change could increase the length of a day by 2.62 milliseconds by the end of the century — overtaking the natural impacts of the moon. “In barely 200 years, we will have altered the Earth’s climate system so much that we are witnessing its impact on the very way Earth spins,” Adhikari told CNN. A few milliseconds of additional time a day may be imperceptible to humans but it has an impact on technology. Precise timekeeping is vital for GPS, which everyone with a smartphone will have, as well as other communication and navigation systems. These use highly precise atomic time, based on the frequency of certain atoms. From the late 1960s, the world started using coordinated universal time (UTC) to set time zones. UTC relies on atomic clocks but still keeps pace with the planet’s rotation. That means at some point “leap seconds” need to be added or subtracted to keep alignment with the Earth’s rotation. Some studies have also suggested a correlation between an increase in day length and an increase in earthquakes, said Mostafa Kiani Shahvandi, a study author and a geoscientist at ETH Zurich. But the connection remains speculative and much more research needs to be done to establish any clear link, he told CNN. A paper on the same topic published in March concluded that while climate change was increasingly slowing the Earth’s rotation, processes in the Earth’s core could be more important and actually be speeding it up, shortening day length. “What we have done is to go a little bit further and re-estimate these trends,” said Shahvandi. They found any influence from the molten core was outweighed by that of climate change. Duncan Agnew, professor of geophysics at the University of California San Diego and author of the March study, said the new study still meshes with his research, “and is valuable because it extends the result further into the future and looks at more than one climate scenario.” Jacqueline McCleary, an assistant professor in physics at Northeastern University who was not involved in the study, said the new research helps inform “a decades-long debate over what role, exactly, climate change will play in the changing length of the day.” While there is now general agreement climate change will have a “net lengthening effect on the day,” she told CNN, there has still been uncertainty about which processes affecting time will dominate this century. This study concludes climate change is now the second-most dominant factor, she said. It’s a sobering conclusion, said ETH Zurich’s Soja. “We have to consider that we are now influencing Earth’s orientation in space so much that we are dominating effects that have been in action for billions of years.”"

Williams, CNN","As what was possibly the “largest IT outage in history” impacted computer systems across the globe this week, a Northern California weather forecaster found a creative – and hands-on – solution to keep his viewers updated as his news station’s software remained offline. On Friday, many computer systems for healthcare, business, technology and government sectors worldwide crashed after cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike issued a software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems. The widespread disturbance affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or fewer than 1% of all Windows machines, Microsoft said Saturday. The lengthy process of restoring operations continued on Saturday. But early Friday morning, Preston Donion, a forecaster and multimedia journalist for CNN affiliate KRCR in Redding, California, says he woke up to chaos after “everything had gone completely haywire” with the systems at his job the night before. “They didn’t end up even running a broadcast on our stations at 10 and 11 (p.m.), so they were really kaput,” Donion told CNN on Saturday. He says he rushed into work to find that, sure enough, they had no weather graphics available. Donion and his producer teamed up to figure out how they could display a weather forecast on air with the systems down, he said. “Because I have my numbers, I can get my forecast built, but I have no way to communicate that,” recalled Donion, who’s worked at KRCR since June 2022. He says he spent the first half hour of the show pulling up websites or screen sharing from one of the station’s iPads and stepping off the screen to read numbers. “But I realized that wasn’t very engaging, wasn’t very effective,” Donion said. About 45 minutes into the broadcast, the Washington native says he used a Sharpie and a pen to draw a rough sketch of a map he had saved as a reference for familiarizing himself with California. “I just went to work on the back of a piece of paper that had my rundown on it, and just did my best,” Donion said. His on-air solution to the tech fiasco turned out to be the hand-drawn maps of his coverage area, which he admitted to viewers weren’t “perfect” renderings. “I just drew this up,” Donion can be seen telling local viewers in a video he shared to his X account Friday. “I know Trinity County looks like it’s been on somewhat of a diet there, and things are a little square in Modoc County, but I wanted to give you a visual.” He also shared on air the seven-day forecast using a chart he typed in his phone’s Notes app, the video shows. “I thought it was the best way to just kind of put together some visuals without having computer technology, so it was fun to me,” said Donion. One viewer commented the retro approach to the forecast took them back to the 1970s, when TV meteorologists used paper maps and magnets in their weather centers, he said. “I definitely got some messages on Facebook and on Twitter saying, ‘Hey, you know, thanks for adapting. We appreciate you just getting the information out,’” Donion said. “Other meteorologists have reached out and said, ‘You know, I was thinking I’d have to get my magnets out,’” he added. Many of KRCR’s systems were back online by the end of Donion’s shift around 11 a.m. local time Friday, and the evening shows went smoothly, he shared. CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa gave kudos to Donion for his quick thinking. While learning about meteorology in school, Raffa says weather students learned to hand-draw fronts and storm systems. “It’s a skill you never think you’ll need again – until the computers go out,” Raffa said. “And if you ask a 30-plus-year veteran in the industry, they’d be happy to remind us that this was how weather was done before the magic of green screens,” she added. “Markers, chalk, magnets and a whole lot of paper were used to get a forecast on TV. It’s amazing how much we depend on technology now!” CNN’s Dalia Faheid contributed to this report."

Rescuers navigated streets on speedboats, at times wading through waist-deep floodwaters to pluck people from their homes, footage circulating online showed. It’s a story playing out across China. In the past two weeks, tens of thousands have been evacuated across multiple provinces in the country following deadly floods and landslides, which have blocked highways, destroyed homes and caused devastating financial losses as they wiped out crops and livestock. The lurch from dry weather to flooding also throws into sharp focus the major challenge for the Chinese government as emergency response and recovery becomes a regular occurrence – and as extreme weather is only expected to become more frequent due to human-driven climate change. The flooding in Henan and surrounding provinces last week – and the double hit of arid heat and floods in a matter of weeks – has prolonged what has already been a devastating period of extreme weather across China that’s forecast to continue. Torrential rainfall has hit southern, central and eastern parts of the country and led to major emergency response efforts in a flood season that has started some two months ahead of its typical schedule and only last week entered what’s known as its peak period. China’s ruling Communist Party acknowledged the urgency of the situation last week, when a communique following a landmark meeting of its top members led by Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to “refine the measures for monitoring, preventing, and controlling natural disasters, especially floods.” The government has in recent years grown increasingly alert to the domestic risk of climate change – including its potential impact on food security as drought and floods hit lands critical for the national grain supply. China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, has looked to position itself as a leader in the global transition to green energy – even as it’s met challenges weaning itself off coal due to high demand for power. Authorities are meanwhile grappling with the latest crises amid mounting social frustration with China’s stuttering economy and the broader direction of the country – and as local governments strapped with high levels of debt are tasked with recovery efforts. Before last week’s floods, natural disasters had already cost nearly $13 billion in direct economic losses and affected 32 million people this year, China’s Ministry of Emergency Management said on July 12. “Last night I couldn’t sleep at all,” one farmer in Henan’s Nanyang city said as he surveyed submerged crop fields in a video posted to social media and shared by a government-linked account. “All my hard work for a year has come to nothing.” As the heavy rains moved across central China in recent days, accounts of loss and devastated livelihoods also spread across social and local media. At least 34 people have been killed since last weekend due to flooding and landslides, including 15 who died in a bridge collapse in Shaanxi province Friday following flash floods and heavy rain. It comes after flooding and landslides late last month killed at least 71 people in southern China. One video posted on social media showed a farmer in Sichuan province wading through chest-high waters to pick corn – clearly determined not to lose his harvest. Meanwhile, a farmer in flood-hit Hunan lost more than 800 pigs – taking a hit of about $275,000 – after his barn was inundated this month, he told state-backed Agricultural Television. Retailers and farmers have also taken to social media to sell flooded crops at a discount – for many a last-ditch attempt to salvage an income in a country where research shows insurance coverage is low compared with other major economies. As of Sunday, 10 provinces were under emergency alerts for flooding, according to national weather authorities, with more heavy rain expected in the coming days. A typhoon that hit China’s Hainan island Monday is expected to make landfall on the mainland as a tropical storm Tuesday, while a cyclone that could strengthen to a typhoon is expected to hit coastal China later this week, according to CNN Weather. China’s government has mounted a top-down effort to revamp how the country responds to extreme weather in recent years after 2021 floods in Henan’s Zhengzhou killed more than 300 people. And climate scientists earlier this month issued a stark warning, calling the country a “hotspot where the impacts of climate change are acutely felt.” Observers say authorities have made progress, especially when it comes to early warnings and response, weather monitoring and certain infrastructure development – but they also note more must be done in China – like many countries grappling with climate change – to prepare for the impact of more frequent extreme weather. “While policies and strategies are being developed and implemented, the pace and scale of action often fall short of what is needed to effectively mitigate the risks and impacts of climate change,” said Hongzhang Xu, an adjunct research fellow at the Australian National University. That need may be more acute in remote, rural or mountainous regions, often populated by vulnerable elderly populations and with fewer resources, as well as provinces not historically prone to severe flooding, like in China’s northeastern breadbasket, which endured extreme rains last year. Guangtao Fu, a professor of water intelligence at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, said that although the government has been investing in water infrastructure to boost flood protection there was a “significant gap” in investment to maintain existing systems. That urgency was underscored earlier this month when a dike alongside China’s second-largest freshwater lake burst after 17 days of heavy rains – flooding nearly 20 square miles of land and displacing at least 7,000 people, according to official reports. Another challenge, experts say, is bolstering recovery from severe flooding, where damaged croplands, destroyed homes and devastated livelihoods can take months to recover. Local governments are typically tasked with managing reconstruction efforts, while the central government plays a role in planning and financing. But there have been past issues of misappropriation of state recovery funds, for example following the deadly 2021 floods in Zhengzhou. And only about 8% of an aggregate $25 billion in losses in China from flooding caused by Typhoon Doksuri last summer were covered by insurance, according to data from global insurance firm Munich Re. “Farmlands need to be re-plowed, and fully restoring soil quality would take several months,” said Li Zhao, a senior researcher at Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing. “For the residential houses, each household should spend a lot of money to rebuild – just to recover from this kind of event is very difficult.” Those living in flood-prone areas also face a tough choice as the risks grow, she added. “Maybe in the future, we will see how people make the decision,” she said. “Are they moving to a safer place? Or will they go back to the villages (and rebuild)?” CNN’s Fred He contributed reporting."

","Angela Fritz, CNN","Sunday was the hottest day in recorded history, according to preliminary data from a climate tracking agency monitoring temperatures since the mid-1900s. It’s the second consecutive year average global temperatures have crashed through shocking climate records and will not be the last, as planet-warming fossil fuel pollution drives temperatures to shocking new highs. July 21 clocked in at 17.09 degrees Celsius, or 62.76 Fahrenheit, and was the hottest day on Earth since at least 1940, according to the preliminary data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Global average temperatures typically peak during the Northern Hemisphere summer, between late June and early August. Sunday’s record came as many countries endure prolonged and brutal heat waves. Around a hundred cities across the US are experiencing their hottest start to summer on record, and swaths of southern Europe have been grappling with triple-digit temperatures. Despite being based on data from the mid-20th century, the temperature records represent the warmest period the planet has seen in at least 100,000 years, scientists have found from many millennia of climate data extracted from ice cores and coral reefs. Global climate records are typically broken by tiny fractions of a degree, as was the case with this one: Sunday’s temperature was just 0.01 degrees Celsius above 2023’s record. What’s jarring is the warmest global temperatures were significantly cooler by about 0.3 degrees before 2023. “We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate keeps warming, we are bound to see new records being broken in future months and years,” said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus. These recent records are “truly straggering,” Buontempo said. “We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate keeps warming, we are bound to see new records being broken in future months and years.” Global temperatures fluctuate based on natural factors: seasons, large-scale climate patterns and solar activity — and on unnatural factors: the pollution from human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels, which is chiefly driving the planet’s temperature steadily upward. Scientists pegged last year’s record to the coincidence of El Niño, a natural climate pattern in the Pacific ocean with a warming effect, and fossil fuel pollution, which is trapping heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. This year’s record comes as El Niño is disappearing and transitioning to its cool La Niña phase, underscoring the significant influence of the human-caused climate crisis. The sudden rise in global temperatures is linked to abnormal heat in large parts of Antarctica, according to the Copernicus analysis. The rapid warming of this vast, icy continent is a trend that is alarming scientists given the region’s ability to drive catastrophic sea level rise."

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","As Vice President Kamala Harris marches toward the Democratic nomination, climate advocates like what they see. Even before he’s finished his term, President Joe Biden made his stamp as the most pro-climate president in history. And Harris is an exciting climate candidate in her own right, multiple advocates told CNN. Harris is a “tremendous champion” on climate and environmental justice, said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters Action Fund. Climate action has run through Harris’s career for decades. As California’s attorney general, Harris sued big oil companies like BP and ConocoPhillips, and investigated Exxon Mobil for its role in climate change disinformation. While in the Senate, she sponsored the Green New Deal resolution. And as vice president, Harris made the crucial tie-breaking vote to pass Democrats’ historic climate bill. “Vice President Harris would kick ass against Trump,” Biden’s first national climate adviser Gina McCarthy said in a statement. “She will fight every day for all Americans to have access to clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment.” Harris’s candidacy comes at a make-or-break moment for the planet. 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 has only continued that trend, with fresh data showing July 21 was the hottest day on record globally. With rising global temperatures pushing the world closer to irreparable harm, scientists and energy groups say the only way to minimize the damage is to rapidly deploy clean energy on a massive scale by the end of this decade. Advocates say Harris’s record on climate couldn’t be more different from her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump – a man who has vowed to pull the US out of its climate commitments and to “drill, baby, drill.” With Democrats quickly uniting around Harris, they are eager to shine the spotlight back on Trump’s agenda. “It’s largely been forgotten how disastrous Trump has been on climate and how disastrous it would be for our planet if he’s elected again,” Jamal Raad, co-founder and former executive director of Evergreen Action, told CNN. The stakes of the 2024 election for the global climate couldn’t be higher. Trump has vowed to push America decisively back to fossil fuels, promising to unwind Biden’s climate and clean energy legacy and pull America out of its global climate commitments. Given the stakes, climate advocates are eager to shine a light on the stark contrast between Trump and Harris. “Harris wants to keep building this bright clean energy future, and Trump and Big Oil really do represent the worst of our past,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of advocacy group Climate Power. Republicans are already attacking Harris on energy, specifically for her earlier support of a fracking ban during her 2020 campaign for president. Biden opposed such a ban, and Harris later walked back that support when she became his running mate. Democrats are hoping to use their climate agenda to motivate young people, which polls showed Biden was struggling with. Advocates said Democrats may benefit from a younger candidate speaking to young voters on climate. And advocates added Harris’s detachment from some of Biden’s more controversial moves on climate as president – such as his approval last year of the massive Alaska oil drilling project known as Willow – may benefit her. Members of the youth climate group Sunrise Movement will be watching to see whether Harris moves to distinguish herself from Biden on Willow, Sunrise Movement spokesperson Stevie O’Hanlon told CNN. “Does Harris break from Biden’s most unpopular decisions with young people?” O’Hanlon said. “She has an opportunity to define herself as a new candidate and as different from Biden. That’s the critical work for her in the coming days.” A second Democratic administration will continue implementing Biden’s climate bill and defend many of Biden’s marquee climate rules against legal challenges. If elected, one of the biggest climate goals Harris would have to craft early in her administration is how much the planet would reduce its climate pollution by 2035 – a requirement of the Paris climate agreement—the same agreement Trump has vowed he would once again pull the US out of if elected. A recent analysis from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group found that while the US isn’t on track to hit Biden’s goal of slashing US emissions in half by 2030, it could surpass that goal by 2035. The Rhodium report shows cutting emissions in the power sector will be essential to US climate goals, and that will take strong Environmental Protect Agency rules in addition to Biden’s climate bill. “It will matter who’s in control of the EPA,” Rhodium analyst Ben King told CNN. Harris has maintained a close working relationship with Biden’s environmental cabinet heads, including EPA administrator Michael Regan. The two have traveled together, including on a listening tour on lead pipes. Speaking to CNN, Regan recalled an emotional and in-depth conversation Harris had with a Milwaukee mother whose son was affected by lead poisoning. “She engaged in a conversation with that mother that I’ll never forget,” Regan said. “There isn’t a lot of relief you can provide to someone who has gone through that experience, but she found a way to connect.” Whether on lead pipes or dispersing billions in climate funding, Regan said Harris is a leader who “doesn’t do surface – she digs in.”"

But it is putting some of that wealth to work in support of startups trying to find solutions for the climate crisis. In April, Abu Dhabi tech ecosystem Hub71 announced its first-ever program designed to support decarbonization technologies, which included five startups focused on solutions for sectors ranging from energy to aquaculture. “The climate agenda is very important to the leadership of the UAE,” Ahmad Ali Alwan, the CEO of Hub71, which is backed by state fund Mubadala Investment Company, told CNN. “So we identified it to be a priority sector which we want to enable.”“There’s a lot of support for innovative solutions,” he said, and “a focus on developing solutions that are actually commercial.” The United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven emirates including Abu Dhabi and Dubai, was the first Gulf country to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In recent years Abu Dhabi has funneled tens of billions of dollars into supporting renewable energy projects and carbon reduction technologies, and restored some 6,400 hectares of mangroves, which can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Alwan says that about 20 of the more than 220 startups involved in Hub71’s programs can be put into the sustainability and climate technology bucket. Now that the ecosystem has a program dedicated to these companies, he expects that number to grow. Hub71 plans to announce a new cohort later this year, and it says that applications from sustainability and climate tech startups have doubled since the last intake. Abu Dhabi is far from abandoning fossil fuels. Oil production accounts for about 46% of its economy. The UAE, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has in recent years found itself at odds with the group’s leadership. OPEC and its allies have been limiting oil output to prevent a glut and bolster prices. Meanwhile, the UAE has been pushing the alliance to raise its production quota. State-owned oil giant Adnoc wants to increase its capacity to five million barrels per day by 2027. It will spend $150 billion to meet that target, according to S&P Global. Abu Dhabi’s continued dependence on oil has caused doubts in some quarters about its commitment to decarbonization. But experts say the government is planning ahead to reshape its economy. Patricia Keating, of consultancy PwC Middle East, told CNN the government has laid out a forward-looking diversification strategy focused on how it can grow sustainably. “Abu Dhabi is starting to forge ahead as a leading tech cluster for climate in the region,” she said. The city has a concentration of venture capitalists and investment funds, attractive regulation and corporates that need to decarbonize, she added, giving it an edge in the climate technology space. Companies in the latest Hub71 cohort include a startup that provides oil and gas plant engineers with real-time recommendations about how to reduce emissions, and another focused on mitigating gas flaring — the burning of or releasing of natural gas that comes out of the ground during oil production, which contributes to climate change. Another, called Graphmatech, is a spin-off from Sweden’s Uppsala University, and claims its graphene technology can make the hydrogen industry more sustainable, efficient and safer. When hydrogen is burned or used in a fuel cell, the major biproduct is water, instead of atmosphere-warming carbon dioxide. This makes the energy source a lower emissions option compared to other fuels that pollute more. That Abu Dhabi has thrown its weight and oil wealth behind climate tech is a key attraction for Graphmatech. “To scale up climate tech you need financial support,” Dr Mamoun Taher, its founder and CEO, told CNN. “Abu Dhabi is known globally to have financial muscles.” Experts believe that green hydrogen, which is produced with renewable energy, can play an important role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, like heavy industry and long-distance transport. Countries from the United States to Australia are working to develop their own hydrogen industries, and the UAE wants to become one of the world’s largest producers of the element by 2031. It plans to produce “low-carbon” hydrogen generated from a variety of sources, including renewable and nuclear energy, and fossil fuels paired with carbon capture and storage. There is work underway in the UAE to push hydrogen technology forward. Masdar and Emirates Steel Arkan are developing a pilot project to demonstrate the possibility of using green hydrogen, instead of natural gas, to make steel. Steel production accounts for about 8% of global emissions. Hydrogen, though, is known to leak. Not only is that wasteful, it can also lead to explosions and exacerbate global warming. Taher says his graphene technology can reduce the leakage of hydrogen by up to 85%. His company has engaged in discussions with key stakeholders in Abu Dhabi, including oil and gas companies. “What makes Abu Dhabi unique is the access to the early adopters for our technology,” he said. Companies including Adnoc, Siemens Energy and Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) are supporting the Hub71 program with funding or commitments to run pilot programs with promising solutions, or both — potentially allowing climate startups to use the UAE as a test bed for their technologies."

But this season – which is expected to be hyperactive – got off to a historic start when Beryl exploded into a ferocious Category 5 hurricane in early July. Beryl was supercharged by ocean waters as warm as they should be in September – a phenomenon becoming more common as the planet warms due to fossil fuel pollution. The rapidly intensifying hurricane also had two other ingredients needed for storms to form that have been missing ever since: moist air and a lack of storm-disrupting upper level winds, called wind shear. Ocean temperatures are still off the charts, but a vast expanse of dry, dusty air has limited moisture and helped rein in tropical activity over the Atlantic post-Beryl. This so-called Saharan dust originates from dust storms in Africa, gets trapped in a layer of air above the surface and is then carried out over the Atlantic by persistent winds. Batches of Saharan dust flow out of Africa and over the Atlantic year-round, but high concentrations peak in the early summer, just like this year. This July has so far produced the month’s second-highest concentration of dust over the tropical Atlantic on record, according to an analysis by hurricane expert Michael Lowry. Reliable satellite data for this measurement begins in 2002. But this disruptive dry, dusty air isn’t sticking around and will likely dissipate in August, according to Klotzbach. Dust wasn’t the only factor keeping the Atlantic quiet after Beryl. Upper-level winds were too hostile for hurricanes to develop in July, but signs point to calmer winds and favorable conditions in the weeks to come, according to Klotzbach. Klotzbach estimates all of the necessary atmospheric conditions will come together in the next week and a half, which will open the door for more hurricanes. While Klotzbach doesn’t think a storm is guaranteed to form immediately after conducive conditions align, it’s only a matter of time before one does. Forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center highlight an area for potential tropical development from July 31 to August 6. Part of the western Atlantic and the Caribbean has at least a 20% chance of tropical development during that timeframe. That 20%-or-greater chance persists through mid-August and expands across almost the entire tropical Atlantic, from west of Cabo Verde into the eastern Caribbean. The most active period of the Atlantic hurricane season typically runs from mid-August to mid-October, with activity peaking around September 10. Once hurricane season wakes up again, quiet periods could be few and far between."

","Anna Cooban, CNN","Air New Zealand has ditched a key target to reduce its carbon emissions by 2030, citing delays in deliveries of new fuel-efficient aircraft and costly low-carbon jet fuels. The airline said in a statement on Tuesday that it had been hamstrung in recent months by “the availability of new aircraft (and) the affordability and availability of alternative jet fuels.” “It is possible the airline may need to retain its existing fleet for longer than planned due to global manufacturing and supply chain issues that could potentially slow the introduction of newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft into the fleet,” Greg Foran, the airline’s chief executive, said in the statement. Air New Zealand is waiting for eight Boeing 787 Dreamliners and five Airbus A320neo and A3201neo planes, according to its website. Boeing has faced a slew of safety and production problems in recent months, resulting in delayed deliveries of its jets to airlines. Airbus, too, last month blamed “persistent” issues in its supply chain for a cut to its number of planned deliveries this year. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An Airbus spokesperson told CNN that the company does not “disclose customer delivery schedules.” Air New Zealand, which runs nearly 3,400 flights a week to 49 domestic and international destinations, set a target in 2022 to reduce its carbon emissions by 28.9% by the end of the decade when measured against 2019 levels. Still, Air New Zealand’s decision to abandon its target is a warning shot for an industry trying to meet its climate goals through changes in aircraft design and the increased use of cleaner fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF has a lower carbon footprint than traditional jet fuel because it’s made from waste products, where the carbon has already been emitted; or from plants that absorb CO2 as they grow. But at the moment, there is far greater demand than supply of SAF. That was much higher than the 5% reduction target in international aviation emissions by 2030 agreed by 193 countries at a United Nations-backed conference last November. The aviation industry accounted for 2% of global energy-related carbon emissions in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). However, that share could quickly increase if measures, such as transitioning to SAF, reducing flights and more efficient aircraft designs, are not adopted fast enough. “Planned production capacity for sustainable aviation fuels will provide just a small fraction of jet fuel demand by 2027,” notes the IEA on its website. In its statement, Air New Zealand said it was considering introducing “a new near-term” target that “could better reflect the challenges relating to aircraft and alternative jet fuel availability within the industry.” The airline’s ambition to achieve net zero by 2050 — meaning it would emit no more carbon into the atmosphere than it removes — remains unchanged, it added. A New Zealand government discussion paper published in June showed that the country could miss its CO2 reduction target for 2035 because of a change in climate policies since its center-right government came into power last year, Reuters reported. New Zealand is one of several countries veering off track to hit targets in the 2030s. Angela Dewan contributed reporting."

","Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN","While inflation in the US has been cooling since hitting a four-decade high, the temperature outside continues to climb. It’s been one of the hottest summers on record for much of the country and the planet, which last week experienced the hottest day in recorded history. But US consumers aren’t only taking a financial hit from this summer’s extreme heat by way of their electricity bills. Shoppers could soon have to pay much higher prices for fruit and vegetables as farmers shoulder higher growing costs from the heat, a reversal of a trend seen over the past year with the cost of fruits and vegetables dropping by 1%, according to June Consumer Price Index data. Tom Avinelis, who owns organic farms that grow blueberries and citrus fruits around Fresno, California, and the Willamette Valley in Oregon, said near-record-breaking heat waves this month with temperatures upwards of 100 degrees in both areas has caused more fruit than usual to shrivel, resulting in less harvestable produce. “It decreases a lot of our revenue potential,” said Avinelis, whose produce is managed by Homegrown Organic Farms, which sells nationwide in stores such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Costco and Safeway. For the rest of this summer, consumers aren’t likely to see markedly higher prices for seasonal fruits like blueberries because contracts with distributors and retailers tend to be worked out in advance, he said. “But, as we see more and more of these heat events, it will challenge production and change the supply and demand dynamics,” Avinelis, who has been in the agriculture business for over 40 years, told CNN. That’s why in the next few years, he said, the prices consumers pay will be higher to be more reflective of the expenses farmers like him are incurring to adapt to more extreme heat, such as installing upgraded irrigation systems. Yet despite those upgrades, he says he is still at a disadvantage compared to nonorganic farmers who can use the plant equivalent of sunscreen on citrus trees to shield them from some heat. Even corn, one of the top-produced crops in the US with most states growing it, is suffering steep losses from heat. A 2021 study published by the Atlantic Council found that corn growers in the US are losing “$720 million in revenue annually due to heat’s effect on crop yields, which will increase to a projected $1.7 billion annually by 2030.” “The consequences of this could include farm closures and higher prices for food and livestock feed,” the study notes. Researchers from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, and Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence in Abu Dhabi estimated that temperatures three degrees above historic averages have a significant chance of reducing strawberry yields by as much as 40%. Their recently published analysis drew from publicly available data on strawberry yields in Santa Maria, California, from 2011 to 2019 and monthly temperature averages there from 1991 to 2021. One of the researchers, Kumaraswamy Ponnambalam, who teaches systems design engineering at the University of Waterloo, told CNN the project launched because a supermarket chain in Canada reached out to his team in search of software to help them better predict the prices they’ll pay for the produce they sell to customers. Ponnambalam said his team chose to focus on strawberries because the supermarket told him they are the most challenging type of produce to forecast pricing for, especially as an importer. As Ponnambalam and his team helped design software for them, they suspected there was a correlation between temperature and crop yields, prompting their separate, more in-depth analysis. Ponnambalam and his coauthors said their findings can be used to help “guide farmers and policymakers in implementing effective climate change adaptation strategies in strawberry production and potentially in other high-value agricultural crops.” Henry Gordon-Smith, the CEO and founder of Agritecture, an agriculture consulting and advisory firm that specializes in climate change planning, said many growers he works with have maintained the same output as past years, but it’s “come at a significantly higher cost.” “Increased water usage, additional labor for monitoring and managing heat stress, and investments in protective measures like shade cloths all contribute to higher production costs,” he told CNN. “Despite these efforts, in some cases, the output is still lower, and the quality of the produce can be compromised.” Ultimately, the effects of climate change have caused an increasing number of farmers to shift their operations entirely indoors, said Gordon-Smith, who recently taught a course titled “Smart Agriculture for a Changing Climate” at Columbia University. Having an environment where farmers can control environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, and other environmental factors helps “to mitigate the adverse effects of heat waves,” he said. However, the steep costs to make that switch could also contribute to higher prices consumers pay for produce. For farmers who aren’t able to or may not be willing to shift to indoor growing, Gordon-Smith’s strategy to help them survive heat waves involves using sensors and artificial intelligence tools to track weather and make predictions that guide their decisions. “The challenges posed by extreme heat underscore the urgent need for adaptive strategies in agriculture,” he said."

Dry, dusty air has helped keep the Atlantic hurricane-free ever since. But a disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms in the eastern Caribbean is expected to encounter favorable atmospheric conditions by this weekend and develop into a tropical depression or tropical storm. The next tropical storm that forms will be given the name Debby. The system will track along the northern Caribbean through Friday before emerging near the Bahamas or Florida early this weekend. It’s exact track through the Caribbean will determine when a tropical system could form. It will likely struggle to organize enough to be considered a tropical depression or storm if it interacts with the disruptive mountainous areas of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and eastern Cuba. The tropical wave could organize sooner if it skims just north of the islands and dodges the terrain. Ocean temperatures in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf are abnormally warm and could strengthen the system, no matter when and where it forms. It’s still unclear what path the system will take. A strong area of high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean could steer the cyclone anywhere from the eastern Gulf of Mexico to the southeast US coast over the weekend, but its early strength or lack thereof will play a factor in which way it will go. The faster organization occurs, the more likely the cyclone will curve northward sooner and take a track that places the Bahamas and southeast US in its path. A more disorganized system could travel much farther west and approach the Gulf before curving north. August typically marks the beginning of the most active part of hurricane season because ocean waters are very warm, and disruptive upper-level winds and dry, dusty air fade. But ocean temperatures across the Atlantic have been anything but typical this season, and have already proved their mettle. Beryl was able to become the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record in early July partly because waters in the Caribbean were as warm as they normally would be at the peak of hurricane season. Now, parts of the Caribbean and Atlantic are as warm or warmer than they typically are in early October when ocean heat maxes out. Warm oceans are a major consequence of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution and provide the fuel for tropical systems to explode in strength at a breakneck pace. Off-the-charts ocean heat is one reason a chorus of forecasters are calling for a hyperactive hurricane season. A building La Niña and its subsequent lack of disruptive upper level winds, known as wind shear, over the Atlantic are the others. The season started off close to average when Tropical Storm Alberto formed in mid-June – the typical timing for the first named storm of the season. But any semblance of normalcy quickly dissipated once Beryl roared to life at the end of the month. The season’s first hurricane normally forms around August 11 and the first Category 3 or stronger hurricane occurs around September 1, according to the NHC. Beryl obliterated both timeframes. In addition to Alberto and Beryl, the basin also churned out short-lived Tropical Storm Chris."

","Mary Gilbert and Taylor Ward, CNN Meteorologists","A tropical storm warning has been issued and a state of emergency declared in parts of Florida in anticipation of Tropical Storm Debby – a storm that hasn’t yet formed but could unleash multiple days of heavy, flooding rainfall to the state and the southeast United States starting this weekend. The system has 30 mph winds and has been designated Tropical Depression Four by the National Hurricane Center as it comes together over parts of Cuba and the southern Bahamas Friday. It became organized enough to be classified as a tropical depression Friday, according to the 11 p.m. advisory from the hurricane center. Track the Storm: Spaghetti models and more maps here The storm is expected to strengthen into Tropical Storm Debby by Saturday evening. Tropical storm watches and warnings have been extended northward in Florida, according to the 5 p.m. ET advisory from the National Hurricane Center. The tropical storm warning has been extended along the west coast of the Florida peninsula from Bonita Beach to Boca Grande. Meanwhile, the tropical storm watch has been extended northward from Aripeka to the mouth of the Suwannee River. Parts of the Florida Keys and parts of the Central Florida coast are also under a tropical storm watch, with officials urging residents there to prepare for tropical storm conditions within the next 48 hours. The watch includes Fort Myers, Cape Coral and Tampa Bay. The storm’s exact track and strength are still uncertain. How much time the system spends over record-warm water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico will determine how strong it becomes. The storm is expected to turn to the northwest and eventually north over the weekend. However, so far the system has not begun its turn to the northwest, which has led the hurricane center to shift the forecast cone to the west. This will allow more time for strengthening and the hurricane center shows the storm nearing hurricane strength by the time it reaches landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida Monday morning. “The westward shift to the track forecast now also keeps the system over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico longer, giving the system additional time to potentially strengthen,” the hurricane center said. “It is important to note that because of the forecast track being parallel to the west coast of Florida, the location and timing of a potential landfall cannot be pinned down at this time.” It will track parallel to Florida’s Gulf Coast for some time this weekend and strengthen as it does so, before curving east and making landfall. The system’s strength would be limited if it moves more quickly over Florida. “Since the forecast track is almost parallel to the west coast of the Florida Peninsula and the southeast coast of the US, only a small change in the track could lead to large changes in which land areas receive any landfalls and the biggest impacts,” the National Hurricane Center cautioned Friday. Where and when the storm comes ashore and how strong it is at that time will affect the risk of storm surge. For now, up to 3 feet of storm surge is possible this weekend along the coast from South Florida to north of Tampa Bay. No matter its strength, torrential, flooding rain will be the most significant impact from the storm, especially if the system were to slow down, a possible scenario. The flood threat prompted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to declare a state of emergency. The order was issued Thursday for 54 of the state’s 67 counties to mobilize state and local resources ahead of the storm. Sandbag distribution began Friday for residents in several communities in the Orlando and Tampa metros. Multiple counties in the state’s panhandle – including Escambia, Okaloosa and Santa Rosa – started distributing sandbags Thursday. A level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place Saturday for much of South Florida as the system organizes just off the coast, according to the Weather Prediction Center. “Very intense” rainfall rates of 2.5 to 3 inches per hour are possible within the heaviest storms in the system’s outer rain bands Saturday, the WPC warned. Rainfall rates this potent are enough to cause flash flooding, even in marshy areas of the state more capable of handling excess water. The risk to life and property would increase considerably if these intense storms reach the Miami area. Up to 20 inches of rain deluged South Florida in a very short window in early July and produced extremely dangerous flash flooding across the greater Miami metro, resulting in a couple hundred water rescues. The level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall will expand over much of the state and reach into other portions of Georgia and the Carolinas Sunday. Exactly when and where torrential downpours set up outside of Florida will depend on the system’s ultimate track, but heavy rain is possible as early as Sunday afternoon. It’s also possible that this risk level will increase – especially in Florida – once the system’s track comes into further focus. Heavy rain will continue to pound parts of the Southeast early next week, especially if, instead of tracking steadily along the Florida Gulf Coast and making landfall, the system slows down and stalls over one region – potentially around Florida’s Big Bend. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are possible through Monday over much of Florida and the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas. But if the system happens to stall, rainfall totals could increase dramatically. Freshwater flooding – flooding caused by rainfall – has become the deadliest aspect of tropical systems in the last decade, according to research conducted by the National Hurricane Center. A world warming due to fossil fuel pollution is making this potential threat more dangerous. Studies have also shown tropical systems are slowing down over time, which means they’re more likely produce greater rainfall totals over a given area. Oceans are also getting warmer and supercharging storms, pumping them full of moisture. A 2022 study published in the journal Nature Communications found climate change increased hourly rainfall rates in tropical storms by 5 to 10% and in hurricanes by 8 to 11%. CNN’s Sara Smart contributed to this report."

Antarctica’s typical winter cold should be operating at a level unfathomable to most people in the US. Summerlike heat in the dead of winter – even if much of the continent is still below freezing – is an alarming development for a place more capable than any other of generating catastrophic sea level rise as fossil fuel pollution continues to drive global temperatures upward. Most of the planet’s ice is stored here, and were it all to melt, would raise average global sea levels by well over 150 feet. Even smaller icy features, like the so-called Doomsday Glacier, could raise sea levels by 10 feet if they were to melt – catastrophic amounts for the world’s coastal communities. It’s possible more heat waves like this will happen in future winters, which could leave the icy continent less fortified for its hottest season – summer – and more vulnerable to melting during subsequent heat waves, said David Mikolajczyk, a research meteorologist with the Antarctic Meteorological Research and Data Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Increased Antarctic melting could also potentially alter global oceanic circulations, Mikolajczyk told CNN. These circulations play an outsized role in making the planet’s climate habitable. “I’m sure more (impacts) will emerge with time as we understand (this heat wave) better, but at the moment, it’s just a case of astonishment really, what we’re seeing,”  Thomas Bracegirdle, deputy science leader for the British Antarctic Survey’s Atmosphere, Ice and Climate team, said. Bracegirdle told CNN the temperatures in this event were record-breaking and were an important signal of what could be coming in the longer term. Heat waves of this magnitude should be quite rare in Antarctica and scientists aren’t yet certain that they are occurring more frequently, but that may be changing. “All we can say at this stage is that more high temperature extremes are what we expect (in Antarctica) under a changing climate, but for this particular event we’ll have to study more,” Bracegirdle said. It also contributed significantly to Earth’s new hottest day on record in late June, according to an analysis from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. This is the second significant heat wave Antarctica has endured in the last two years. During the previous in March 2022, temperatures in some locations reached up to 70 degrees above normal, the most extreme temperature departures ever recorded in this part of the planet. That unprecedented heat wave was made worse by climate change, according to a 2023 study published in Geophysical Research Letters. Climate change contributed 3.6 degrees of warming to the heat wave and could worsen similar heat waves by 9 to 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, the study found. While the current heat wave hasn’t seen temperature departures reach the level of 2022, it’s been much more expansive and long-lasting, according to Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. And the crucial differences between the two come down to what’s happening in the atmosphere. The set of atmospheric conditions largely responsible for the ongoing heat wave – a breakdown of the southern polar vortex – is only expected to occur once every two decades on average, according to Bracegirdle. “This is a very unusual event, from that perspective,” Bracegirdle added. Just like the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere has a polar vortex – strong winds circulating high in the atmosphere that trap cold air in place. But when the southern polar vortex gets disrupted, it releases cold air trapped over Antarctica and sends bursts of it farther north. This also leaves the door open for air to rush down from the upper atmosphere, warming along the way. The southern polar vortex is disrupted much less frequently than its northern counterpart, which explains why such heat waves are much less frequent, according to Amy Butler, a research physicist at NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Laboratory. This polar vortex disruption began in the second half of July and could continue through the first half of August, perhaps peaking in intensity in about a week, Butler told CNN. This will keep temperatures at the surface elevated. At the same time, multiple surges of warm air from the southwestern Indian Ocean pushed over East Antarctica – which comprises about two-thirds of the entire continent. Each surge of warm air was followed by another so closely that the warming has been nearly continuous over the last few weeks, according to Scambos. East Antarctica – home to the South Pole – is where the most frigid conditions on Earth are found and is typically protected from this kind of extreme warmth, according to Mikolajczyk. But that wasn’t the case in this event or in 2022’s. It’s part of a larger trend with already measured consequences. The South Pole warmed more than three times the global average rate from 1989 to 2018, a 2020 study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found. West Antarctica and its Thwaites “Doomsday” Glacier have been a major focus of scientific research in recent years due to the catastrophic impact its collapse would have on sea level rise. But other research in the last few years has demonstrated that melting in East Antarctica, where this heat wave is happening, is becoming equally troubling. The recent warmth has posed a significant problem to the continent’s crucial ice sheet. Antarctica lost a staggering 280% more ice mass in the 2000s and 2010s than it lost in the 1980s and 1990s, according to a 2019 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “In recent years, I would say that the feeling was that the Arctic is the place where all the rapid change is happening and (change) was happening quite slowly in Antarctica,” Mikolajczyk mused. “But this is just another event that’s showing (change) can also happen quickly in Antarctica.”"

",Opinion by Anita van Breda,"Editor’s Note: Anita van Breda is Senior Director of Environment and Disaster Management at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), based in Washington, DC. She has 20 years of experience working to apply environmentally responsible practices and policies for disaster recovery, reconstruction and risk reduction. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. Thirty seconds. Less than 30 seconds was all it took for an earthquake to tear through Haiti in 2010, claiming more than 200,000 lives and leaving 1.5 million people homeless. In the years of rebuilding required after that half-minute of horror, environmental experts like me joined the effort to help. On fields of rubble that were once bustling neighborhoods, I saw people starting anew. One woman remains seared in my memory: She’d found a dented coffee can, filled it with soil and planted seeds. Green shoots were already growing toward the sun. Even in the bleakest, seemingly hopeless moments, people gravitate toward nature’s ability to renew and restore. But nature is our ally in more ways than one. By making nature a core part of our disaster recovery strategies — leveraging all the benefits that forests and other ecosystems provide — we can rebuild communities stronger and more resilient than before. Charting a safer, more resilient course means first acknowledging that there is no such thing as a “natural disaster.” The word “natural” implies these events are entirely out of our control, thereby absolving us of the responsibility to prepare and reduce risk from natural hazards. But when the ground starts to shake, or floodwaters rush in, it’s not nature’s wrath that’s ultimately responsible for the death toll and destruction. It’s vulnerable social, physical and ecological systems — communities living with inadequate water, sanitation, shelter and healthcare, poorly built and maintained infrastructure, and degraded forests, wetlands and coral reefs unable to provide protection from storms. Because disasters reveal our vulnerabilities, they reflect the choices we make as a society. When we destroy and degrade much of the natural world, we make communities more vulnerable to disasters. Take our dwindling forests. Cutting down trees removes root systems that anchor the soil and vegetation that soaks up rainfall and protects topsoil from erosion. Without the storage capacity these natural systems provide, the risk of devastating floods and landslides increases. When we channelize riverbeds and build on floodplains, we alter how and when water moves through the landscape. When we remove mangroves and sand dunes along the coast, we expose the shoreline to storm surge. Nature is fundamental to supporting life on Earth, adapting to a changing climate and reducing disaster risk. Consider a few ways in which communities across the globe are showing what’s possible when we work with nature instead of against it. One of the core principles of disaster response is “first, do no harm,” and that begins with a thorough post-disaster assessment. After a magnitude 7.3 earthquake in Nepal killed more than 8,000 people and destroyed more than a quarter million homes in 2015, the government conducted a rapid environmental assessment to learn how nature was affected by the disaster — and, just as importantly, how it might be affected by the rebuilding process. Nepal’s assessment served as a blueprint for “building forward” in a way that preserves rather than depletes the natural systems and resources that people need to survive and thrive. By following Nepal’s example and exploring how best to work with the environment, other communities in similar straits can ensure they are better prepared for the future, whether that means using landscape planning to determine the safest locations to rebuild or identifying which crops are most resilient to climate change. The process of building forward could include, among other things, the adoption of 21st-century clean-energy systems. After a powerful EF-5 tornado destroyed 95% of the town in 2007, Greensburg, Kansas, set sustainable rebuilding goals and integrated wind, solar and geothermal energy into their reconstruction plans. Manmade disasters have also imparted lessons here: In Ukraine, where ongoing war has severely damaged the energy sector, the government has responded by shifting from high-emission thermal power, which harnesses energy from steam, to a renewable energy mix that includes wind, solar, biofuel and battery storage. Continued reliance on fossil fuels adds fuel to the fire; by reducing harmful carbon emissions, communities like Greensburg and nations like Ukraine are helping to mitigate worse climate impacts. Moreover, their embrace of clean energy adds much-needed redundancy. The fact that many Texans were still without power nearly two weeks after Hurricane Beryl made landfall — amid record summer heat — underscores the perils of depending on a single energy source. Natural and green infrastructure from wetlands to rain gardens and green roofs — in addition to supporting a diverse array of life — can help communities absorb rainwater, reduce water pollution and regulate temperature. In the wake of Hurricane Stan in 2005, Guatemala and Mexico diversified their farming systems to improve resilience and reduce future disaster risk. Likewise, after Hurricane Michael practically wiped out Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida in 2018, the military bolstered the base’s natural defenses against storm surges by reinforcing dunes, restoring marshes, planting seagrass beds and engineering oyster reefs. Even the selection of building materials makes an enormous difference. After the 2021 Marshall Fire, the costliest wildfire in Colorado’s history, some rebuilding projects used sustainable materials such as compressed earth blocks. In doing so, they can reduce production and construction costs, provide enhanced protection from fire and flooding and reduce the extraction of more natural resources, which can cause further environmental damage that makes communities more vulnerable to disasters. In many countries, the United Nations and others have utilized earthquake debris to build homes, infrastructure and riverbank reinforcements. The scale and number of disasters around the world means we are generating a massive amount of disaster debris. Rather than dumping that debris in wetlands or offshore where it can kill seagrass beds and reefs that protect us from storm surges, we can put it to use rebuilding roads and other infrastructure. We have a choice. We can rebuild the same vulnerabilities by relying only on traditional technology, engineering and materials, or we can embrace innovation and rebuild communities to be safer and more robust in the face of future shocks and stresses. This choice should not be reserved only for a few select people in positions of power. If communities decide to integrate the power of nature into disaster mitigation solutions to prevent, recover from and rebuild after catastrophes, it’s all hands on deck. By working together across society, policymakers, humanitarians, engineers, community organizers, environmentalists, urban planners, lawyers, business owners, nonprofit groups and everyday citizens can help their communities withstand, recover and rebuild from crises. This is exactly the kind of cross-disciplinary approach that made Greensburg, Kansas, a success story and a model for the rest of the US and the world. Mayor Bob Dixson followed the science, fostered public-private partnerships and leveraged the unique strengths of local schools, church groups, city councils and more to mobilize a community-wide response. The collective efforts and vision to recover from the tornado in Greensburg proved that these solutions go beyond partisan politics. You don’t need to believe in climate change to recognize the danger that fires, floods and other natural hazards pose to people, businesses and nature. You just need to recognize that we all have a vested interest in reducing disaster risk, and that environmental management is key to ensuring a safer and more secure future for your community. Those who have learned from the impact of disasters know that resilient societies require resilient ecosystems — particularly in a world marked by a changing climate. From the small act of planting seeds in a coffee can, to restoring entire forests and wetlands, partnering with nature is essential to our survival."

","Alaa Elassar, CNN","Justin Parkin-Rae takes a break from pulling chunks of weeds from around one of the many rivers that snake through Kaikōura, a quaint fishing town on the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island, named Te Waipounamu in his native Māori language. His jade necklace and red hair glisten in the warm February sun as he bends down to pick a juicy blackberry. Behind him, Tamati Wikiriwhi and Nikora Wati are chest deep in the water, laughing as they lift a massive tree branch over their heads. “This water right here is actually what gives life to everything, including us,” Wikiriwhi shouts from the river. The three friends are clearing out the river, which has become stagnant and full of toxic algae blooms due to invasive weeds and broken branches. It’s important work, says Parkin-Rae, because clean waterways allow native plants and wildlife to flourish. They are among a growing community of Māori who are working to counter the catastrophic effects of climate change, which is eroding the country’s shores, destroying its biodiversity, fueling extreme weather and threatening to displace entire communities. It’s an existential threat felt across the world, but it’s more pronounced on island nations like Aotearoa, the indigenous word for New Zealand, and among native people like Māori, whose culture and livelihood are rooted in the environment. Aotearoa New Zealand’s Ministry for the Environment recognized the threat in a 2023 report that found it’s “highly likely” that “climate-related impacts will result in the displacement of Māori living in locations vulnerable to climate change,” which could “disrupt” Māori culture, knowledge and practices. The prediction weighs heavily on Parkin-Rae, who descends from Ngāti Kurī and Ngāi Tahu, two of more than 100 Māori iwi, or tribes. “Without the Earth, there is nothing for us. The land is the people and the people are the land, we are one organism,” he says. It’s that “interconnectedness” that makes Māori ideal stewards of Aotearoa New Zealand, Parkin-Rae says. “No one takes better care of the land than the Indigenous people who have loved and cared for it for thousands of years.” When the Earth cries for help, Māori listen, he says. It’s why the community is organizing conservation projects across the country, hoping to rescue their beloved homeland – and ultimately their culture – by land, sea and sky. The work at Oaro River is part of a reforestation and predator control project led by Te Rūnanga o Kaikōura, a Māori tribal council in Kaikōura. When they’re not cleaning out creeks and rivers, they’re planting or pruning native plants and setting traps to capture invasive pests that endanger local wildlife. The council’s managing director, Rawiri Manawatu, says global warming, urban sprawl and the spread of invasive plants and wildlife have wreaked havoc on the country’s ecosystem. Clearing waterways and reintroducing native plants help preserve the land’s natural filtration system, Manawatu says. Native plants also support biodiversity by providing food and shelter to local wildlife, including vulnerable birds like the tītī, kawau tikitiki and tarāpunga. “The Māori view is that native plants are part of the Earth Mother, so to sustain her, she needs her native trees to be growing instead of the other pest plants,” he says, referring to species introduced when European settlers began arriving in the 19th century. For Māori, reforestation is also critical to maintaining their culture, as they rely on native plants and animals for food, medicine and other long-held traditions. For instance, Māori believe birds are the children of Tāne (god of the forest) and bridge the gap between the spiritual and physical realms. They weave kākahu (cloaks) from the feathers of birds whose qualities they hope to acquire. But as habitats suffer, bird populations decline, making it increasingly difficult to maintain the tradition. A popular Māori proverb states: “Te toto o te tangata, he kai; te oranga o te tangata, he whenua.” (While food provides the blood in our veins, our health is drawn from the land.) With that in mind, the conservationists begin each work day by forming a circle, holding hands and reciting a prayer of gratitude and a blessing for the land. Daily tasks are assigned based on the phases of the moon. On this day, tangaroa ā roto, the last quarter or waning half moon, signals high energy from the ocean gods, so it’s advised to do heavy duty weeding and river cleaning work. “What we are trying to do is to return our Earth to its natural state,” Parkin-Rae says. “Back to the way it was before humans destroyed it without a care for what that destruction would one day mean for humankind.” Along the shoreline on the other side of Kaikōura, where tourists perch atop giant rocks with binoculars and a salty breeze knocks against fishing boats, Thomas Kahu sits at a meeting room table staring intently at a map of Aotearoa New Zealand and its surrounding ocean. He points to a spot off the coast and explains there’s a giant canyon just below the surface. It stretches over 37 miles and is nearly 4,000 feet deep, attracting all the Southern Ocean’s migratory whales – including blue whales, humpbacks, orcas, and more than 200 resident sperm whales who live off the coast. To Māori, whales aren’t just majestic creatures, but sacred ancestors and the descendants of the ocean gods Hinemoana and Tangaroa, says Kahu, chairman of Whale Watch Kaikōura, Aotearoa New Zealand’s oldest whale watching business. The company, which also works in whale research and conservation, is owned and operated by local Māori who have cared for the island’s marine life for hundreds of years. “In Māori mythology, we see ourselves as the younger brother of the whale, so the connection is very special,” Kahu says, before sharing a story about his ancestor Paikea the whale rider, who Māori believe came to Aotearoa New Zealand from the Pacific Islands centuries ago on the back of a whale. But due to climate change and toxic human behavior, the whales are in danger. Global warming is raising the temperature of ocean water and melting glaciers, which is causing sea level rise; the freshening of sea water; and increased acidification. Together, it’s destroying the whale’s habitat and killing off vital food sources, according to Aotearoa New Zealand’s Department of Conservation. The situation is worsened by frequent ship strikes that leave whales dead, injured or stranded; and overfishing, which has collapsed krill populations on which whales depend. “Without our whales, and I don’t say this lightly, it would be catastrophic for us as Māori but also for the entire world,” Kahu says. Whale Watch Kaikōura operates its tours with whale conservation in mind. Its vessels are designed to be extremely quiet so they don’t disrupt whale songs, which are vital for their communication and echolocation. The company is also developing a hydrophone system, which it plans to share with other vessels, providing real-time visibility of whales below the surface to avoid strikes and better understand their behavior. Mere Takoko, former vice president of Conservation International Aotearoa and co-founder of Pacific Whale Fund, says such conservation efforts are vital because whales play a key role in tackling climate change – specifically through the whale pump. The whale pump is a process that begins when whales plunge deep into the ocean to feed on krill, before returning to the surface and defecating. Their waste, packed with nutrients, feeds the phytoplankton, the foundation of the ocean’s food chain. Krill then feed off phytoplankton, and the cycle continues. “If that whole system collapses…life as we know it in the oceans will cease to exist. And that will be hugely problematic for us as humanity, because every second breath we take comes from oxygen generated by our oceans.” says Takoko, also a descendant of Paikea. Saving the whales is good for the climate, but it’s also personal for Māori. In March, Māori leaders, along with other indigenous groups in the Pacific, signed a groundbreaking treaty declaring whales to be legal persons with inherent rights, including freedom of movement, a healthy environment, and the ability to thrive alongside humanity. The effort was led by conservation group Hinemoana Halo Ocean Initiative, which Takoko also founded. While the declaration is non-binding and still needs government recognition to become law, conservationists hope personhood will lead to enhanced protections for whales and severe penalties for those who harm them. “When I see a whale, it feels like going home,” Takoko says. “It feels like going back to my mother, going back to my ancestors. They are home and we can’t afford to lose that.” Daniel Gaussen stands on a mountain summit with his head tilted back, staring at the billions of stars that illuminate the night sky above Lake Takapō. He’s quiet, seemingly lost in wonderment, but snaps back to reality when a guest asks a question about supernovas. Gaussen works with the Dark Sky Project, an observation center co-owned by the Ngāi Tahu tribe at the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve, the largest dark sky reserve in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, artificial light sources are strictly regulated, enhancing the night sky’s quality so well that the Milky Way is visible to the naked eye. A dark sky is vital to Māori culture, which has relied on fiery constellations for generations to guide weary travelers and connect them with the spirits of their ancestors. But across much of Earth, dark skies are at risk, with serious implications for the environment. Artificial lighting generates 2 billion tons of carbon every year, contributing to catastrophic levels of greenhouse gas emissions. It also has negative health impacts on humans and wildlife, according to the Night Sky Resource Center. Light pollution disrupts the day-night cycle rhythm, Gaussen says. In humans, that can lead to sleep disorders, depression, obesity and more. For animals, it throws off their mating, hunting and migratory patterns, which causes further harm to the ecosystem. It also affects climate science, he adds. Astronomers, atmospheric scientists and climatologists need dark skies to conduct thorough research that helps them understand the impacts of climate change and predict future nature events. “If we want to survive as a species, understanding space is critical,” Gaussen says. “How do you predict earthquakes and tsunamis and all these terrible disasters? You need to understand the planet, you need to understand the internal mechanics and in order to do that, you need to understand how planets form and how they grow, and all these things related to our research. But if we can’t see the sky, we can’t do that research.” Mikey Ratahi, a Māori astronomer and tour guide with the Dark Sky Project, says Māori have always followed the stars, using them as tools for migration and living by mātauranga (knowledge) about the stars that match the laws of science today. Stars were especially valuable in the winter because they helped determine wind and rain patterns, where to forage crops and find water. The level of sky and star visibility also forecasted the weather, which helped Māori decide when to travel and when to seek shelter. “They are a navigation tool but also a sacred part of who we are. We look out to the sky for prayer, and acknowledge the sky through celebrations, disasters, funerals and gatherings. Many people also have sky names,” Ratahi says. “It’s such a big piece of us because Ranginui, our sky father, is considered to be one of two progenitors of the Māori origin story.” Ratahi’s passion for the sky comes from more than the Māori soul tie to nature. It is his responsibility as Māori, he says, “to look after what you have taken, to look after the health and resources of the Earth,” not only for your benefit, but for generations to come. Gaussen agrees: “The sky inspires us. If kids don’t get the opportunity to learn and to see the sky and understand the big picture, it’s a disservice to humanity. If we’re going to survive and work with nature and develop all these new green technologies, we need scientists, engineers, people who have been inspired from a young age to help the world.” With cleanup at Oaro River nearly complete, Manawatu of Te Rūnanga o Kaikōura puts his sunglasses back on and wipes the sweat off his brow. Their work isn’t easy, but it’s fulfilling, he says. Māori-led initiatives like his can be found throughout Aotearoa New Zealand, but the indigenous community also works with the national government on larger environmental programs, which draw on Māori knowledge and expertise. The Ministry for the Environment, for instance, has enacted a freshwater management system rooted in the Māori concept of Te Mana o Te Wai, which protects the life-supporting capacity of water. In practice, this means prioritizing the health of freshwater sources – like rivers and streams – above social or economic needs. “Incorporating te ao Māori (the Māori world) into our work is valuable to all of Aotearoa. We acknowledge the role of tangata whenua (people of the land) to help create a flourishing environment for every generation,” the Ministry for the Environment states on its website. But to the roughly 17% of New Zealanders who are Māori, it doesn’t always feel that way, Manawatu says. “Local councils do really well working with local Māori. Even when we have opposing opinions that don’t always align, they’re open to working with us and listening to the way we do things,” he says. “But we don’t think the government on the national level is ready to incorporate Māori into everything that we do as a country, especially with the environment.” Māori leaders want higher ranking positions and the opportunity to play increasingly prominent roles in the establishment of nationwide environmental policies, as well as broader acceptance of Māori beliefs, knowledge and traditions, he says. Like his teammate Parkin-Rae, Manawatu believes many Pākehā (non-Māori New Zealanders) don’t trust the indigenous community to lead the charge. He says institutional racism has a lot to do with it. “We still have a class of people that still think that we are not indigenous to the land and that we simply hopped on our waka (canoe) and ended up here by mistake.” Since late 2023, thousands of Māori have rallied against the country’s new right-leaning government, which they say is anti-Māori and planning to rollback decades of initiatives designed to improve Māori lives and the environment. Among them is a plan to reverse a ban on offshore gas and oil exploration, which could endanger the country’s rich marine life. Some fear the rollbacks will make it even more difficult for Aotearoa New Zealand to reach its goal of reducing greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050, which new data suggests it will fail to do. But it doesn’t have to be that way, Parkin-Rae says. Māori could help steer the country to a brighter future, where its people and environment coexist in harmony, and the rest of the world can follow suit. “It used to be the land and the people were connected, but society has driven us away from that. For thousands and thousands of years we lived with the Earth and it’ll go back that way eventually,” he says. “There’s no reason why we can’t have society and still respect the Earth, and we’re showing you can do it.” Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action."

How to financially prepare yourself for a disaster,08/11/2024,"                                                 No part of the United States is spared the risk of extreme weather events, which have been hitting harder in recent years.                                             ","Jeanne Sahadi, CNN","No part of the United States is spared the risk of extreme weather events, which have been hitting harder in recent years. From wildfires and tornadoes to hurricanes and flooding to prolonged heat waves, the potential damage from extreme weather to people, animals and property is high. Especially if you’re a homeowner. And especially if you live in or near high-risk areas. However, there are steps you can take right now to help speed the process of repair and recovery after a devastating storm, should you ever be directly hit. Beyond any physical essentials your family and pets might need if you have to evacuate or shelter in place, pull together an administrative emergency kit, so to speak — physical and virtual. “Things can happen very quickly. You should have that go bag with all your important documents in an easy-to-remember, easy-to-access place,” said Loretta Worters, a spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute. “You can get an insurance check pretty quickly if you have all the documentation.” Consider, for example, wildfires. At least 38 states are at risk for them, according to the III. A wildfire can reduce your home and all your belongings to ash. “When [your house] burns there’s nothing to show what you have,” Worters said. That’s why she recommends taking photos or videos of your house and its contents — even just on your cellphone. Store them in the cloud and if possible keep a physical copy with your important papers or on a flash drive. Also — and dog and cat owners will no doubt be spoiled for choice — include a current photo of your pet, in case you get separated. If you do ever get hit with a devastating weather event, be sure to take photos soon after impact, so you can better tell your before-and-after story to insurers, said Keith Turi, acting director of response and recovery at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Having sufficient insurance is key to preserving your finances and sanity after a disaster. In 2023 alone, there was nearly $80 billion in insured losses due to 89 natural catastrophes in the US like wildfires and flooding, according to the III. So, periodically check that the policies you do have cover you for the type of extreme weather event that may occur and cover the cost of what you’d want to replace. For instance, Worters said, stay apprised of rebuilding costs. They may be higher than you think. Note that if you live in an area prone to floods, standard homeowner policies typically won’t cover flood damage. To learn more about the potential costs of flooding and how to get flood insurance, you can visit floodsmart.gov, Turi recommended. Lastly, double check that the coverage for your possessions will make you whole — or whole enough. The coverage in most homeowners’ policies for possessions amounts to between 50% and 70% of the value of your home structure, Worters said. So, for every $100,000 in coverage for the structure of your home, you might have $50,000 to $70,000 in coverage for your possessions in the home — from your furniture and household items to your piano. Keep a physical copy of your insurance coverage and the title and deed to your home in a waterproof or fireproof bag or other container. Make an emergency contact list to keep with your other documents that includes the policy and account numbers for all your insurance policies as well as the insurers’ phone numbers, emails and website addresses — e.g., for health and prescriptions; home, auto and life; plus any pet coverage you may have. Also include on your list the contact information and account numbers for your bank, investment and retirement accounts. If you have pets, include your vet’s contact information and that of any boarding facilities you might need to use if ever you have to evacuate. Or, alternatively, the names of pet-friendly places the whole family can stay. You might also add to your list a FEMA helpline number so you can register for assistance after a disaster: 800-621-3362. Other key documents that III recommends you have at the ready to throw into your go bag are your birth and marriage certificates, passports, a driver’s license (unless it’s in your wallet on your person), your most recent tax return, any hard-copy stock certificates and your will. Since you may have to pay initially for hotel or motel rooms and meals immediately after a disaster, the national public service campaign Ready recommends having cash or traveler’s checks available in your emergency kit. Another option if you have more than one credit card is to use your second or third card sparingly, so that you have enough under that card’s credit limit to charge such immediate expenses."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/climate/us-cities-heating-up-fastest-dg/index.html,American cities are getting unbearably hot. These ones are roasting the most,08-13-2024,"                                                 Climate change is turbo-charging summer temperatures all over the country, but heat is more intense in cities, where over 260 million Americans live.                                             ","Amy O'Kruk and Angela Dewan, CNN","No, it’s not your imagination — summers in the US really are getting hotter. And longer. Human-caused climate change is turbocharging heat all over the country, but it’s most intense in cities, where more than 260 million Americans live. That’s because buildings, roads and sidewalks radiate more heat than grass and trees, in what’s known as the urban heat island effect, which can add as much at 20 degrees Fahrenheit to urban temperatures. All of the country’s 50 most-populated cities have gotten hotter over the past half century, and all but three are experiencing more “extremely hot” days above 95 degrees, according to a data analysis by the International Institute for Environment and Development, shared exclusively with CNN. Here’s which cities are on the frontlines. Summer this year has been punctuated by record-breaking temperatures, blackouts and train delays as tracks overheated, warped and threatened derailment. In one Arizona county, hundreds of people are believed to have died from heat-related causes. Paramedics in Phoenix now travel with body bags filled with ice in which to immerse people suffering heat exhaustion or heatstroke. If you take the country’s 50-biggest cities and add up the number of days above 95 degrees, there have been at least 1,071 this summer — 161 more than the average over the past decade for the same period. Those days aren’t spread evenly across cities. Las Vegas and Phoenix, for example, have both experienced more than 80 days over 95 degrees this summer, while coastal cities in California, like Los Angeles and San Fransisco, have been spared entirely. Washington, DC, and Baltimore are both experiencing their hottest summers in at least a decade. Each has recorded at least 18 extremely hot days this year. Last summer, they logged just three and five, respectively through the end of July. In terms of which cities have seen the biggest increase in days above 95 degrees, Las Vegas comes out on top. It has roasted this summer, with 83 days — 18 more than its average over the past decade — and every July day in the city was above 105, topping out at 120. San Antonio, Texas, experienced 54 extremely hot days, 16 more than its 2013-to-2023 average, while Nashville, Tennessee has logged 23, also 16 days above average. There has been a leap in the number of extremely hot days in the past five decades: from 1,064 to 1,857 among the 50 most populated cities. That’s a jump from an average of 21 days per city to 37. “The overall trend is clear: major American cities have experienced a significant rise in the number of extremely hot days,” said Tucker Landesman, a senior researcher with the International Institute for Environment and Development. More days of extreme heat and temperatures rising by a few degrees may sound manageable, but even small increases, especially when coupled with a rise in humidity, can raise the risk of serious health emergencies, like heat exhaustion and even heatstroke, which can be fatal. And those impacts are having an outsized impact on vulnerable groups. “Recent years have proved heat is a killer and this can be particularly true for children, the elderly, and people on lower incomes or who live in substandard housing,” Landesman told CNN. “High temperatures are also linked with premature and still births, and other health problems during pregnancy.” Over the long term, big cities in Texas, Arizona and inland California have been worst-hit, in terms of the rise in extremely hot days. Of the 10 cities that recorded the biggest increase since the mid-70s, seven are in Texas. In 1976, San Antonio experienced one week’s worth of extreme heat, but by 2023 it had jumped to nearly 13 weeks — an increase of 1,276%. Austin went from less than three weeks to more than 12, while Houston went from just over one week to more than seven. Beyond climate change, parts of Texas have become more vulnerable to extreme heat in the past five decades because its cities have rapidly sprawled and its urban centers have become more dense. And populations there are still growing fast: In 2023, San Antonio added 22,000 people to its population, more than any other city, followed by Fort Worth, which added more than 21,000. In Austin, city officials are aiming to cover 50% of the city with tree canopy by 2050 to fend off some of the urban heat getting trapped in its concrete and asphalt. “Too often, heat is talked about as just ‘the weather.’ But we’ve built our cities to be heat islands, often much hotter than the surrounding land, which exacerbates the effects of climate change,” Landesman said. “This effect can be especially acute in low-income areas that lack quality green space.” Outside Texas, but also in the top 10 cities for the greatest rise in extremely hot days, is Tucson, Arizona, which went from 79 days to 132, as well as Fresno, California, from 60 to 92, and Denver, Colorado, from just 5 days to 31 — that’s a leap from one work week of extreme heat to six full weeks. Of the 50 cities, only three — Los Angeles, Omaha and Kansas City — did not experience an increase in extremely hot days over the five-decade period. Arizonans living in urban centers are used to the extreme heat of the desert, but like much of the country, they too are having to adapt to even longer periods of heat. Phoenix, Mesa and Tucson have the most days of extreme heat. Phoenix reached 158 days on average in 2023 — three weeks more than 50 years ago and 40% of the year. Tucson’s increase was Arizona’s biggest, with 53 more extremely hot days — or seven more weeks. If you’re one of those people who thinks summer hasn’t started until you hit a truly hot day, then summers are starting earlier and finishing later. In the decade from 1974 to 1983, the first extremely hot day of the season, on average, hit on June 22, and the last on September 4. But over the past decade, that period is starting more than a week earlier and is running about a week longer than it used to. That’s why, if you happened to have lived in those earlier decades, summers may feel like they’re getting longer. As heat proves deadly, there is growing awareness of the importance of adapting to a hotter world to avoid breaching temperatures that challenge human survivability, all the while reducing fossil fuel pollution as much as possible. Landesman suggests cities expand green spaces, increase shade, provide public cooling stations and improve messaging about the dangers of heat to prevent serious consequences and costs to human health. “As the world’s richest country, the United States has the resources and technology needed to address extreme heat,” Landesman said. “We can’t air-condition our way out of this problem — in fact that would just make it worse, because the US gets so much of its electricity from burning fossil fuels. It would also be prohibitively expensive for the most vulnerable, and cities should be liveable for everyone, not just the wealthy.”"

Technical difficulties derailed the start of the interview by more than 40 minutes, creating a public stumble for the Trump campaign as it looks to regain momentum in the race. The former president eventually fielded friendly questions from Musk while slamming Vice President Kamala Harris’ stances on the economy and immigration. A CNN fact check found that Trump made at least 20 false claims during the conversation. Meanwhile, Democrats are gearing up for their national convention in Chicago next week, where Harris will formally accept her party’s nomination for president on Thursday night. Tropical Storm Ernesto has formed in the Atlantic and is racing toward the Caribbean and Puerto Rico with heavy rainfall, gusty winds and dangerous seas as a predicted hyperactive hurricane season ramps up. The fast-moving system will bring tropical storm conditions — including potentially damaging winds and heavy rainfall — to the Leeward Islands today. Those conditions are expected to spread across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by the end of the day. Officials warn that the combination of rain and wind could cause issues for Puerto Rico’s vulnerable electrical infrastructure. Ernesto will not follow Debby’s continental US-bound path but will intensify into a hurricane over very warm ocean water, potentially placing Bermuda in harm’s way. A magnitude 4.4 earthquake occurred in Los Angeles at 12:20 p.m. PT on Monday, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake startled residents, rattled schools and interrupted several live and recorded shows. Monday’s shaking prompted the Los Angeles Fire Department to go into earthquake mode, with crews at 106 fire stations doing surveys of their districts.

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Tropical activity in an unusually active hurricane season will take a breather after Ernesto, but forecasters don’t believe it will last long. Atlantic storms will be limited for at least the next week. Dry, dusty air and some disruptive winds in the upper atmosphere are making it difficult for stormy weather to get its act together. A similar setup kept the Atlantic quiet for a few weeks following record-breaking Hurricane Beryl. But this brief break in activity isn’t likely to last nearly as long, according to forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center. Once the dry, dusty air eases, Atlantic tropical activity could be off to the races as stormy weather pushes off the coast of Africa and out to sea unimpeded. The center’s latest forecast highlights a broad area in the Atlantic from the western coast of Africa to the Caribbean where tropical activity could reignite in late August and early September. The western tropical Atlantic, just east of the Caribbean, has the greatest chance for development during the same timeframe. A 40% or greater development chance stretches nearly into mid-September over much of the tropical Atlantic, according to the forecast, so hurricane season might not be hitting the brakes again anytime soon. This isn’t surprising because the climatological peak of hurricane season is just a few weeks away. The Atlantic ocean is also still near record-warm, which could help systems develop and potentially explode in strength – something becoming more common in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Warm water was one of the chief reasons a chorus of expert voices have called for a hyperactive hurricane season, with multiple groups – including NOAA – saying close to two dozen named storms are possible by season’s end. The season has already been unusually active, producing five named storms – three of which became hurricanes – by mid-August. Ernesto strengthened into the third hurricane of the season almost a month earlier than normal, according to the NHC. Beryl also shattered expectations when it became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record in early July. It was a major hurricane – Category 3 or stronger – almost two months ahead of schedule. These early storms aren’t the only signal of how unusually active the season has been. This season is the third most active to date since the 1960s, according to one measure of tropical activity used by hurricane experts. Only 2005 and 1980 had a more active start to hurricane season, according to Michael Lowry, a hurricane expert. The busiest part of hurricane season typically starts in mid-August, peaks around September 10 and persists into mid-October. About 68% of all Atlantic tropical activity typically unfolds after September 1, according to data tracked by researchers at Colorado State University. This season has already racked up about half of the activity an entire normal season would produce with plenty of tropical activity to come."

Here are the ones that worked best",08-22-2024,                                                 A “first-of-its-kind” analysis has identified policies around the world that have done the most to rein in planet-heating pollution — with some surprising results.                                             ,"Laura Paddison and Ella Nilsen, CNN","As the need for effective global climate action becomes ever more urgent, a “first-of-its-kind” analysis has identified policies around the world that have done the most to rein in planet-heating pollution — with some surprising results. Researchers from several European climate institutions analyzed the effectiveness of 1,500 climate policies across 41 countries over the past two decades, in a study published Thursday in the journal Science. They found just 63 “success stories” — standalone policies or combinations that achieved large cuts in climate pollution. While the relatively small number may be “sobering,” the researchers said in a statement, the findings provide a blueprint for what works. The researchers trawled through vast amounts of climate data to find countries that had significant downturns in pollution — average reductions of 19% — in their building, electricity, industry and transportation sectors between 1998 and 2022. Then they mapped these against the policies those countries introduced or strengthened during the same period. “We basically do the reverse of what other people have done before,” said Nicolas Koch, an environmental economist at the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Germany, and a lead author on the study. “We first look at (climate pollution) effects, and then try to explain the effects with policies.” Some of the findings were unexpected, Koch told CNN. When it came to popular climate policies, such as bans on new coal-fired power plants or gas-guzzling cars, “the surprising finding, really, is that we never detect successful large emission reductions if these policy tools are used alone,” he said. That’s not to say they shouldn’t be implemented, Koch added, but rather they need to be accompanied by other measures, like taxes or price incentives. Bans on their own “are not credible if the phase-out plan is just out there,” Koch said. But if policy makers also introduce additional measures — a gas-powered car ban plus a climate tax on fuel — then it becomes more credible and changes investor and consumer expectations, he said. Policy combinations, rather than standalone policies, had the greatest level of success, according to the study. The United States, for example, experienced a significant reduction in planet-heating pollution from its transportation sector after the 2008 financial crisis. This was due to a mix of tax breaks for low-carbon vehicles as well as a reform in fuel efficiency standards, the study found. “That combination turned out to be effective … so this really a good news story for the US,” Koch said. It’s a model Democrats replicated on steroids in 2022 when they passed President Joe Biden’s climate law; pairing a massive amount of tax breaks for electric vehicles, solar panels and energy-efficient home appliances, along with with federal rules to slash emissions from the most-polluting sectors: natural gas and oil, transportation and power generation. The UK made a big cut in planet-heating pollution from electricity in 2015 and 2016 following a coal phase-out plan, a carbon minimum price for UK power producers, stricter air pollution standards and subsidies for renewable energy. The policy that did show big climate impacts when implemented alone is arguably one of the least socially popular: taxation. But a tax on carbon can be complemented with more socially acceptable policies, Koch said, to ensure the burden doesn’t fall on those least able to shoulder it. Carbon taxes are widely unpopular in the US Congress, but there have been several bills introduced that would implement a “carbon border adjustment tax,” which would tax imported products based on how much pollution they emitted in the country where they were created. Those bills are seen as a response to a similar EU measure passed last year. Which policies work best varies across countries and sectors and follow-up research is needed to better understand how to design climate policy mixes that work in specific contexts, Koch said. “This is the most sophisticated study to date,” said Michael Grubb, a professor of international energy and climate change at University College London, who was not involved in the research. “It’s an important step forward in analysis of ‘what works’,” he added. However, he added, the focus only on big emissions cuts means “they miss the impact of thousands of smaller efforts globally.” Hanna Fekete, a co-founder of the NewClimate Institute who was also not involved in the research, said the study provides yet more evidence that “current climate action is insufficient.” Even if the most successful policies implemented so far were scaled up to a global level, it would still not close the gap between where emissions are heading and where they need to be in order to rein in catastrophic warming, she said. She called on countries to develop a clear vision of where they want to be in 30 or 40 years time, “and then really implement policies today and make them future proof.”"

","Mary Gilbert and Robert Shackelford, CNN Meteorologist","The Atlantic hurricane season might be quiet for now, but the same can’t be said in the Pacific, where Hurricane Hone is bearing down on Hawaii. A tropical storm warning is in effect for Hawaii’s Big Island with the storm bringing heavy rain, strong winds, dangerous seas and fire concerns to a tinder-dry state still recovering from one of the most devastating fires in US history. Much of the island is also under a flash flood warning, with Hilo International Airport having seen a 36-hour rainfall total of 4.46 inches. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green declared a state of emergency Saturday evening due to the threats from Hone and the elevated fire danger in the state. The disaster emergency relief period will continue through Monday, according to the proclamation. Tropical activity has been abundant in the Pacific Ocean this year, but none of the seven East Pacific named storms have come close to Hawaii. Hone, the first storm to form in the Central Pacific since 2019, has broken that mold. Hone reached hurricane strength early Sunday. It continued to strengthen, reaching maximum sustained winds of 85 mph later in the morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. It’s about 210 miles south-southeast of Honolulu, moving west at 8 mph as it begins to gradually move away from the Big Island. The storm is forecast to remain at hurricane strength before starting to weaken Sunday afternoon. It’s expected to pass near or just south of the Big Island through early Sunday and will continue to head west Sunday and into Monday before beginning to slow. Tropical storm-force winds extend about 115 miles from the center of Hone and are beginning to impact the Big Island. Widespread wind gusts across the Big Island could reach 70 mph with gusts at summits potentially reaching 85 mph. Widespread rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches were expected on the windward and southeast facing slopes of the Big Island, according to the hurricane center. “Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller islands, mainly windward,” it warned. Maui could see around 6 inches and Oahu could pick up 2 to 4 inches of rain into early this week, especially on the eastern side of the island. Heavy rain could cause flash flooding and area waterways to swell. In addition to potentially flooding rainfall, Hone will also deliver gusty winds this weekend, especially over the Big Island. “Winds are expected to be strongest where they blow downslope from higher terrain, over headlands and through passes,” the hurricane center warned on Saturday. The storm’s strongest winds were expected to last from late Saturday through Sunday as it passes south of the Big Island. Breezy conditions continue to raise fire danger concerns over parts of the state where winds get stronger without the rain to accompany them. Red flag warnings have been issued for leeward areas which generally include the western and southern coasts of each island in Hawaii’s chain. Lahaina, which was devastated by wildfires last year, is also under a red flag warning. The increased fire danger is particularly concerning given drought conditions in the state are worse this year than they were at the time of last year’s devastating wildfires. Wildfires in Maui last August left more than 100 people dead and caused $6 billion in damage. Given Hone’s rain, fire weather conditions don’t appear to be as severe as those during last year’s fires, but if dry fuels like grasses and trees catch fire, they will quickly go up in flames. Strong winds could fan those flames and rapidly spread fire to nearby locations. Around the time of last year’s fires, about 15% of the state was experiencing at least moderate drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. As of August 20, moderate drought or worse conditions covered 73% of Hawaii. Hone may not be the only system Hawaii contends with over the next couple of weeks. Gilma, which was a Category 3 hurricane as of Saturday evening as it roared over the open Pacific, will continue to track west. The system will weaken as it approaches Hawaii, but whatever remains of it could take a swipe at the state late next week. Interests in and around Hawaii may need to continue to monitor for tropical trouble even into early September. CNN’s Paradise Afshar contributed to this report."

","Helen Regan, CNN","A “worldwide catastrophe” is imperiling Pacific Islands and the world must respond to the unprecedented and devastating impacts of rising seas “before it is too late,” the United Nations chief has warned. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a global SOS – “Save Our Seas” – from the Pacific Island nation of Tonga on Tuesday with a plea to the world to “massively increase finance and support for vulnerable countries” in grave danger of the human-caused climate crisis. “The ocean is overflowing,” Guterres said. “This is a crazy situation: Rising seas are a crisis entirely of humanity’s making. A crisis that will soon swell to an almost unimaginable scale, with no lifeboat to take us back to safety.” Guterres’ dire warning was made at a meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum in the Tongan capital Nukuʻalofa, and coincided with the release of two UN reports detailing how the climate crisis is accelerating disastrous changes to the ocean. Sea surface temperatures in the Southwest Pacific have risen three times faster than the global average since 1980, according to the World Meteorological Organization’s State of the Climate. And sea levels in the region have risen at almost twice the global average over the past 30 years, it found. In that time, the report said marine heat waves have doubled in frequency and become more intense and longer lasting. Oceans have absorbed 90% of global heating, caused by humans burning fossil fuels that release heat-trapping pollution, the report said. This ocean heating is boosting sea level rise, as water expands when it heats, and melting ice sheets and glaciers have added to the volume. The Pacific Islands are being hit harder than most, suffering a “triple whammy” of ocean heating, sea level rise and acidification, which is harming ecosystems, damaging crops, contaminating fresh water sources, and destroying livelihoods. Worsening floods and tropical storms are already devastating the islands. The report said that in 2023, 34 mostly storm or flood-related “hydrometeorological hazard events” led to more than 200 deaths and affected 25 million people in the region. The ocean is “undergoing changes which will be irreversible for centuries to come,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo. “Human activities have weakened the capacity of the ocean to sustain and protect us and – through sea level rise – are transforming a lifelong friend into a growing threat.” In a second report published Tuesday, the UN’s climate action team said the climate crisis and sea level rise “are no longer distant threats,” especially for the Pacific. Pacific Islands account for just 0.02% of global emissions but are “uniquely exposed,” Guterres said. “This is a region with an average elevation just 1 to 2 meters above sea level, where around 90% of people live within 5 kilometers of the coast, and where half the infrastructure is within 500 meters of the sea,” he said. If the world continues its path of heating to 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the Pacific Islands can expect to see at least another 15 centimeters of additional sea level rise by 2050 and more than 30 days of coastal flooding per year, the report found. In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded it is “unequivocal” that humans have caused the climate crisis and that “widespread and rapid changes” have already occurred, some of them irreversibly. Tuesday’s report said, “emerging research on climate ‘tipping points’ and ice-sheet dynamics is raising alarm among scientists that future sea-level rise could be much larger and occur sooner than previously thought.” Though Pacific Islands face “severe and disproportionate” impacts from rising seas, it is a global problem that poses “major risks to the safety, security, and sustainability of many low-lying islands, populous coastal megacities, large tropical agricultural deltas, and Arctic communities,” the climate leaders said. Both reports call on global leaders to improve early warning systems for vulnerable communities, majorly increase funding for resilience and adaptation, and make deep, rapid and immediate cuts in emissions to keep global heating to within 1.5 degrees Celsius — a critical threshold that world leaders agreed warming should remain below to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. “Surging seas are coming for us all,” Guterres said. “The world must look to the Pacific and listen to science… if we save the Pacific, we also save ourselves.”"

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Fall is a season of transitions: brutally hot summer days give way to crisp fall evenings, green leaves take on colorful hues and fresh summertime flavors are drowned out by the warmth of baking spices. But while pumpkin spice is already overtaking the country, the familiar fall feel may take much longer to materialize as the warmth of an intensely hot summer in the United States shows signs it could bleed into the new season – a trend as the world warms from fossil fuel pollution. “The fall season is increasingly being seen as an extension of summer,” said Jennifer Marlon, a climate scientist at the Yale School of the Environment. “It’s warming fast.” Intense, frequent and long-lasting warmups will likely make this summer the hottest on record for nearly 100 cities in the West, South and East, including Las Vegas, Phoenix and Washington, DC. Some locations had a brief taste of fall-like weather in the last couple of weeks only to have this summer’s sizzling temperatures reemerge with a vengeance. Take Philadelphia, for instance. High temperatures in the low to mid-70s made it feel like late-September for a few days last week. But the heat index – how the combination of heat and humidity feels to the body – will hit the triple-digits there on Wednesday. Tens of millions of people were under heat alerts Wednesday with potentially record-breaking high temperatures possible in the East and widespread highs in the 90s and lows 100s for much of the country. This temperature rollercoaster could be a theme of the season. Despite continued cool flashes warmth appears poised to stick around in fall for much of the US. Fall technically starts in September, but the more consistent cooler temperatures associated with it become more widespread across the country by the second half of the month. The problem is, summerlike heat isn’t going down without a fight, according to the latest forecasts. The most unusual warmth forecast during the month stretches from the central and southern Rockies southeast through the South and then north up the entire East Coast. The northern tier of the country from the Pacific Northwest to the Upper Midwest has the greatest chance to remain closer to normal, according to the Climate Prediction Center. Above-average temperatures will largely continue through October and November, according to the CPC. The entirety of fall will not feel exactly like summer even with elevated average temperatures. Typical high temperatures drop by around 20 to 25 degrees from mid-July to mid-October for much of the US. Denver, for example, falls from a normal high near 90 degrees in July to a high in the mid 60s in October. The East Coast could get somewhat of a reprieve from abnormal warmth this fall if an active hurricane season has anything to say about it. Despite some quiet periods, the Atlantic hurricane season is expected to pick up again soon. La Niña is expected to build during the fall and could enhance tropical activity in the Atlantic. The natural climate pattern marked by cooler than average ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean exerts its greatest influence on US weather in winter, but signs of it could arise later this fall. Forecasters are monitoring potential tropical trouble at the turn of the month; the climatological peak of hurricane season is less than two weeks away; and the most active portion of the season continues through mid-October. Any storms that pass near US coasts through the end of hurricane season could also unload rain and “result in periods of cooler-than-normal temperatures for these areas this fall,” the CPC said. The active hurricane forecast also means the East Coast could end the fall wetter than normal. The other extreme is possible over large sections of the western and central US, where lower than normal precipitation is forecast. A lack of necessary rain could worsen drought conditions in areas that have already spent the summer drying out."

This will keep the north-central and northeast US strapped into a temperature roller coaster while the South could get its first notable break from intense summer heat in many weeks. But summer is bleeding into fall as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution, so the cooldown isn’t expected to last more than a handful of days before temperatures creep back up again. The flip from warm to cool to warm is a trend that could continue through much of fall, according to the latest seasonal forecasts. The north-central US will be the first area to relish in the front’s relief when it plunges into the country late Saturday. Cooler air will spread farther south and east from there Sunday, and by the evening, fall-like weather will have reached most of the Midwest. Chicago will see a late-September-like high in the low 70s for Labor Day Monday. It’ll be a drastic change from the heat in the city earlier this week. On Tuesday, Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport soared to a record-breaking 99 degrees for the date, which was the highest temperature recorded at the site all summer. Next week’s cooldown won’t be the city’s first short-lived taste of fall this month. A lot of the northern US has been on a temperature roller coaster in the second half of August, flowing from sizzling summer heat to a tease of fall and back again. The cold front will push through the Northeast on Monday, but the region will have already experienced a taste of fall ahead of the front. Cooler air first reappeared in parts of the Northeast Thursday after stormy weather rolled through Wednesday. It felt like mid-September in New York City Thursday with plenty of clouds around and the city only topped out in the mid-70s during the day. Cooler, cloudier weather with daily chances for showers will linger over much of the Northeast through the weekend. Areas south of the Northeast could have to wait until Tuesday for a few days of heat relief to arrive. Washington, DC, maxed out at 101 degrees Wednesday, shattering the day’s record and just a few degrees shy of the metro’s hottest August reading. Wet weather on Friday may bring brief heat relief, but the cool will be short-lived until after the cold front goes through the area early next week. The southern tier of the US has been a literal hot spot all summer, but a cooling trend got underway in parts of the region this week. Wet, cloudy weather this week brought temperatures along the western Gulf Coast a few degrees below what typical for late August. Persistent storminess will keep high temperatures in Houston and New Orleans in the upper 80s into at least early next week. While the Gulf Coast has gotten some relief, that same thing can’t be said about inland areas of the South. Tuesday’s front will finally change that. Atlanta, for example, only had two days so far this summer where high temperatures remained in the low 80s. Tuesday could be the first time since July that the city feels this late-September-like temperature. These fall temperatures will stick around for much of next week in the South, along with daily chances for stormy weather."

The global growth of Islam, and the rise of extremism across religions, also made this an urgent priority.                                             ","Christopher Lamb, Kathleen Magramo, Masrur Jamaluddin, James Legge and Antonia Mortensen, CNN","Since his papacy began in 2013, Pope Francis has signaled his intention to build bridges with other faiths. The global growth of Islam, and the rise of extremism across religions, also made this an urgent priority. On Thursday, in the biggest mosque in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, the pontiff used a joint statement with Indonesia’s Grand Imam Nasaruddin Umar to pinpoint “two serious crises” facing the world: dehumanization and climate change. “The global phenomenon of dehumanization is marked especially by widespread violence and conflict, frequently leading to an alarming number of victims,” said the statement, signed in the sprawling capital Jakarta. “It is particularly worrying that religion is often instrumentalized in this regard, causing suffering to many, especially women, children and the elderly,” it continued. “The role of religion, however, should include promoting and safeguarding the dignity of every human life.” On climate change, the declaration stated that “human exploitation of creation” had led to “various destructive consequences such as natural disasters, global warming and unpredictable weather patterns,” and an “obstacle to the harmonious coexistence of peoples.” Francis arrived at Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, in the morning, driving past streets lined with well-wishers in a metropolis that is one of the fastest sinking cities in the world. That concern has sparked a controversial and expensive plan to relocate Indonesia’s capital entirely. Indonesia, a vast archipelago in the tropics, is vulnerable to sea level rise driven by human-caused climate change, as well as hazards triggered by extreme weather, including floods and landslides. The mosque is next-door to the city’s Catholic cathedral, and the pope visited an underpass known as the “tunnel of friendship” which connects the places of worship. As part of the event, the pope also listened to Islamic prayers being recited by a young blind girl named Syakila, the winner of a national Quran recitation competition. His Indonesia trip and the signing of the declaration are in keeping with his bridge-building approach. But while about 87% of Indonesia’s 280 million people practice Islam, the visit also puts the spotlight on its 8.6 million Catholics and other minorities. His arrival in the archipelago nation “is good news for us, something that strengthens our faith,” said Father Hieronymus Sridanto Ariwobo, a Catholic priest in Jakarta. “And secondly, the pope will come here as a symbol (of) the relationship between the Christian and Muslim here in the country.” Historically, the country’s form of Islam has been moderate and syncretic, often sitting comfortably alongside animist and other pre-Islamic practices, while the state ideology, known as “Pancasila,” encourages religious freedom and social justice. “Indonesia is a great country, a mosaic of cultures, ethnicities and religious traditions, a rich diversity, which is also reflected in the varied ecosystem,” Francis said during Thursday’s inter-faith meeting, which the pontiff spent in a wheelchair. “May no one succumb to the allure of fundamentalism and violence.” The 87-year-old is currently on the longest trip of his pontificate, despite facing health challenges and having started to use a wheelchair in recent years. He is scheduled to hold a mass at Jakarta’s National Stadium later Thursday, which is expected to be attended by about 80,000 people. The following day he leaves for Papua New Guinea, the second leg of a marathon 12-day visit of four countries in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, which also includes East Timor and Singapore. Indonesia is a symbolically strong choice for the kind of inter-faith approach Francis has embraced. In the 13th century, traders from Arabia, Gujarat and China reached what is now Indonesia, buying cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. Some of those spice-trade merchants also brought with them Islam and, as some settled on the islands of Java and Sumatra, the religion gradually blended with local animist beliefs. Christianity came to Indonesia with Portuguese traders more than 200 years later, mainly in the eastern islands of Maluku and Timor. The Jesuit missionary St. Francis Xavier worked in the Maluku islands, but by the late 1600s the Dutch East India Company had expelled all Catholic missionaries. After Japanese occupation during the Second World War, nationalist leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence in 1945. Muslims and Christians have coexisted in Indonesia for decades since its modern founding, and most of its Islamic believers are broadly moderate and syncretic. But there have been occasional bouts of religious tension. In 2021, two suicide bombers attacked Sacred Heart Cathedral in Makassar on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island during a Palm Sunday Mass, injuring at least 14 people. In 2018, at least seven were killed in three church bombings in Indonesia on the same day. Religious minorities have at times faced attacks from vocal Islamist extremist groups and some parts of Indonesia are more conservative, such as the province of Aceh, which practices strict Islamic laws. “Indonesia [is] like a huge laboratory for experiencing a different kind of Islam, a different kind of democracy,” said Ulil Abshar Abdalla, a leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, the country’s biggest Islamic organization. Milawati, a Catholic who like many Indonesians goes by one name, said she hopes the pope’s visit will send a message to her compatriots to “live a life of mutual love, respect and tolerance between other religions” so that the country may progress. “⁠As Catholics, we view all religions as having the same goal, living a good and righteous life and believing in God the Creator,” she said. And Elia Dimas Indahputro, a 47-year-old sound engineer, said the significance of religion is sometimes overstated in parts of Indonesia, adding that mingling between people of different creeds is common. “Even my wife has a different religion, she is Muslim, while I am Catholic,” he told CNN. Francis’ Indonesia visit follows trips to other majority-Muslim nations such as Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, with the latter marking the first time a pope had travelled to the Arabian Peninsula. While in Abu Dhabi in 2019, he signed a historic declaration on inter-faith co-operation with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the leading Sunni Muslim leader."

Meanwhile, temperatures in parts of Antarctica climbed 50 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in July. The Copernicus data confirms what seemed likely after the planet experienced its hottest June on record, followed in July by its hottest single days on record. Summer was capped off by the joint-hottest August on record, Copernicus confirmed Friday. With an average temperature of 16.82 degrees Celsius (62.28 Fahrenheit), it was 1.51 degrees Celsius warmer than an average August in the pre-industrial era, the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. Taken together, the 12 months from September 2023 to August 2024 were the hottest on record for any year-long period, and 1.64 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, Copernicus found. “This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest (calendar) year on record,” Copernicus deputy director Samantha Burgess said in a statement. There are a number of factors that cause global temperatures to fluctuate, including natural climate patterns such as El Niño, which originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean and has a planet-warming effect, as well as human-caused factors such as burning fossil fuels — the main driver of the climate crisis. El Niño, which has helped fuel record temperatures, ended in June, but scientists say its impacts don’t stop immediately. “The record global warmth this summer is expected given the lingering heat from the subsiding El Niño event that has added to the continued heating by emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities,” said Richard Allan, a climate science professor at the University of Reading in the UK. It’s “extremely alarming” that the past 12 months breached 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, Allan told CNN, but said it was “inevitable given the slow pace of action by governments” to cut planet-heating pollution. Scientists have long-warned that the world needs to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels to stave off the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. While they are more concerned with long-term breaches — over decades rather than single years — the steady drumbeat of temporary breaches is an alarming indication of where the world is headed, and what that means for people’s lives. Copernicus’ Burgess warned of much worse to come. “The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” she said."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/weather/hurricane-season-atlantic-storms-climate/index.html,This hurricane season is confounding experts and defying forecasts. What the heck is going on?,09/06/2024,                                                 It’s eerily quiet in the Atlantic during the peak of hurricane season. What’s causing it could be a sign of what’s to come in a warming world.                                             ,"Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","It’s early September – what should be the busiest stretch of hurricane season. Forecasters predicted this one was going to be bad: storm after storm, the most bullish forecasts on record. Instead, the Atlantic Ocean is enveloped in a rare and strange calm that has flummoxed forecasters and reset their expectations. And the whole thing could be a glimpse at what’s to come as the planet gets hotter. Despite ideal conditions that fueled pre-season predictions of upwards of 20 named storms, the immediate prospects for one are low, and none have formed in the Atlantic since Ernesto in mid-August – a streak unmatched in 56 years. “If you had told me a month ago that nothing would (develop) after Ernesto I wouldn’t have believed you,” said Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University. “It’s really surprising.” The strange season has been influenced by extreme atmospheric conditions that are a byproduct of climate change driven by fossil fuel pollution, experts said. And it could also be a “lens” into the more volatile storm behavior of the future, said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. Scientists have long said a warming world will ultimately result in fewer but stronger storms something this season has born the fruit of. Hurricane forecasters, including Klotzbach, were predicting the calendar flip from August to September would revive the season. Many widely used forecast models signaled the same thing. It didn’t pan out. The conditions ideal for hurricane development – warm ocean water, minimal storm-disrupting upper-level winds and plenty of moist air – are there, but the storms aren’t happening. Lesser-understood atmospheric factors have gotten in the way, Klotzbach said, and they have ties to global warming. Take that extremely warm ocean water: The Atlantic has been near-record warm since before the season began. It fueled record-breaking Category 5 Hurricane Beryl, a hurricane with such immense strength so early in the season that it was considered a potential harbinger of a busy season to come. But warm water can’t intensify storms if they never make it there in the first place. Almost all hurricanes originate from stormy weather coming off the coast of Central Africa. Since about mid-summer, these hurricane seeds have been pushed farther north than usual – even into one of the driest areas on Earth – the Sahara Desert. They have also exited Africa much farther north than normal and have been stunted as a result. Dry, dusty air and cooler ocean temperatures here, off the continent’s northwest coast, have combined to choke off storms. The northward shift could be tied to the interaction between extremely warm water in the tropical Atlantic and a small patch of abnormally cool water – a burgeoning Atlantic Niña – near the equator, according to Klotzbach and his group at CSU. The African monsoon is supercharged with a ton of moisture, something that can actually delay tropical storm development, a study published in June in the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems found. It turns out there’s a Goldilocks zone for hurricanes – dry conditions will starve thunderstorms of the fuel they need, but too much can make them so messy that they can’t organize into a cyclone. The moisture needs to be just right. “For the first time, we’re seeing that this is actually the case,” said the study’s lead author, Kelly Núñez Ocasio, who is also an assistant professor at Texas A&M University. “We’re seeing it right now in the Atlantic hurricane season.” The scenario could happen more frequently as the world continues to warm because the atmosphere will hold onto more moisture. Further research is needed to definitively determine the change over time, Núñez Ocasio cautioned. Very warm conditions tied to the climate crisis both at Earth’s surface and higher up in the atmosphere are also limiting the available chaotic energy tropical systems need to form. Along with warming at the surface, even the highest levels of the troposphere – the layer of Earth where all life and most weather happens – are warming over time, a 2023 study published in the journal Nature found. This trend could potentially keep storminess in the Atlantic much more subdued during the hottest part of the year, similar to what unfolded this year. The weather weirdness means there are no immediate legitimate storm prospects. If no storms develop by the typical peak of hurricane season on September 10, it would mark a peak-of-season quiet streak unmatched in nearly 100 years, according to hurricane expert Michael Lowry. Still, experts warn the season isn’t finished and could show signs of life soon. More than 40% of all tropical activity in a typical season occurs after September 10, so there’s plenty of precedent for storms to reinvigorate the Atlantic in the following months. Klotzbach believes the season could reawaken by the second half of September, when these limiting factors could start to lessen. And as the season drags on, the area where storms start to form later in hurricane season creeps closer to the Caribbean and the US coastline, including in the Gulf of Mexico which is record-warm. Plus, La Niña is expected to build throughout the fall and could give a boost to activity in October and November. Anyone in areas at risk for tropical impacts shouldn’t let their guard down because of the recent lull in activity. Storms “will come back,” Klotzbach cautioned. “I still don’t see this season ending well.”"

The Dutch engineer wants to transform a huge stretch of inhospitable desert into green, fertile land teeming with wildlife. His sights are set on Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, an arid, triangle-shaped expanse that connects Africa with Asia. Thousands of years ago it was bursting with life, he said, but years of farming and other human activity have helped turn it into a barren desert. Van der Hoeven is convinced he can bring it back to life. He has spent years fine tuning an initiative aimed at restoring plant and animal life to roughly 13,500 square miles of the Sinai Peninsula, an area slightly bigger than the state of Maryland. The goal: to suck up planet-heating carbon dioxide, increase rainfall and bring food and jobs to local people. He believes it is the answer to a slew of huge global problems. “We are destroying our planet in a way which is scary,” he told CNN. “The only holistic way out of this situation is with large-scale ecological regeneration” So-called desert regreening projects are not new, and this is one of a number around the world seeking to transform arid landscapes. Many aim to halt desertification — the creeping degradation of dry lands — a phenomenon the United Nations calls a “silent, invisible crisis that is destabilizing communities on a global scale.” But the concept is also controversial; critics say transforming deserts is unproven, enormously complex and could negatively affect water and weather in ways we cannot predict. Van der Hoeven’s background may seem unlikely for someone intent on saving the world. As a hydraulic engineer at Belgian dredging company DEME, he worked on projects including building artificial islands in Dubai. But in 2016, the course of his career changed when he was pulled into a venture to help the Egyptian government restore shrinking fish populations in Lake Bardawil, a saltwater lagoon in northern Sinai, separated from the Mediterranean by a narrow sandbar. It used to be more than 100 feet deep but is now less than 10 feet deep in parts, as well as hot and salty. Within a few weeks, van der Hoeven devised a plan to open up the lagoon by creating tidal inlets and dredging “tidal gullies” to get more seawater flowing through, making it deeper, cooler, less salty and more full of marine life. But the more he researched, the bigger he wanted to go. Scanning the terrain in Google Earth, he saw the outline of a network of now dried-up rivers, criss-crossing the Sinai like blood vessels, suggesting this land was once green. He pored over weather models and ecological studies and started to see connections. He could use the sediments dredged from Lake Bardawil to help regreen the surrounding area. “They are salty but they hold very many nutrients and minerals, which you need to start restoring the land,” he said. He would start with the wetlands around the lake, expanding them to lure the birds and fish. Then, he would go higher into the region’s mountains, pumping in the lake’s sediments and layering them to create soils where they could grow different varieties of salt-tolerant plants. These would help revitalize the soils, van der Hoeven said, reducing salt levels and making the land able to support a larger array of plants. Van der Hoeven’s central idea is that adding vegetation to the landscape will mean more evaporation, more clouds forming and more rain falling. It could even change the winds, as greening the region can bring back moisture-laden flows of air, he said. “This could completely change the weather patterns.” None of this will be quick. Van der Hoeven estimates it will take five to seven years to fully revitalize the lake, then between 20 and 40 for the wider regreening. “It’s really nature telling us the speed,” he said. Van der Hoeven’s idea might sound wildly ambitious, but it’s been done before. As he was feverishly planning the Sinai project, he came across the film “Green Gold,” made by cameraman-turned-ecologist John Liu, which documents a huge desert regreening project in the Loess Plateau in northern China. The region, nearly the size of California, had been heavily degraded by years of overuse and overgrazing. With sparse vegetation and covered in thin, ocher-yellow soil, it was very prone to erosion. In an attempt to transform the land, China’s government and the World Bank launched a large-scale regreening program in the 1990s, planting trees and shrubs and implementing grazing bans. In the decades since, the Loess Plateau has flourished. Parts of the land are now carpeted in green, soil erosion has reduced and less sediment flows into the region’s Yellow River, lowering the flood risks. For van der Hoeven, it was further proof his plan could work. He sought out Liu, who was immediately on board. The idea of regreening what was once a “land of milk and honey” was “extremely exciting,” Liu told CNN. “The scale reaches a level that helps prove that restoration can be done on a planetary scale.” It would add to other huge desert regreening projects also underway. The Great Green Wall in Africa, for example, was launched in 2007 to help combat desertification. Originally intended to be a belt of trees planted for thousands of miles across the continent’s Sahel region, the initiative has morphed into a “a mosaic of green and productive landscapes” over 11 countries, said Susan Gardner, director of the ecosystems division at the UN Environment Programme in Nairobi. Restoration efforts are essential for tackling the climate crisis, nature loss and pollution, Gardner told CNN. “We don’t have a choice. We have to do this; we have to listen to the science and act now.” But ecosystems are incredibly complex and when it comes to huge, transformative projects like regreening a desert, some experts are concerned about unintended consequences. In a project’s quest for a successful finish line, there is a risk that it will opt for fast-growing, non-native species which either don’t survive or become invasive, overtaking the surrounding native plants and damaging wildlife, said Alice Hughes, an assistant professor at Hong Kong University’s School of Biological Sciences. Others are water-thirsty, which can cause conflict with people’s needs. During the early stages of Africa’s Great Green Wall project, many of the trees died for lack of water, neglect or because they weren’t suitable for the land. Even in the Loess Plateau, widely credited as an astonishing success, there is evidence the vegetation may be approaching, or even exceeding, what the local water supply can support. A 2020 study of the region found that higher levels of evaporation from trees and plants had little impact in terms of increasing rainfall, and even led to “lower water availability for agriculture or other human demands.” Changing the ecosystem could also mean “potentially changing climate patterns, which may reduce moisture and drive droughts elsewhere,” Hughes said. Evaporation may cool one place but simply deposit the heat in other places. Planting vegetation could even end up having a warming effect. Light-colored deserts can reflect more of the sun’s energy back into space than darker vegetation. “Deserts actually cool the planet,” said Raymond Pierrehumbert, a physics professor at the University of Oxford. While regreening arid places could bring local cooling effects, Pierrehumbert told CNN, they could end up “leaving the rest of the planet worse off.” “We also need to ask ourselves why we are doing it,” Hughes said. These projects can act as “flashy distractions,” she added. “They sound much more exciting than the basic work of protecting existing intact systems, which are still vanishing at astonishing rates.” For Liu, however, there is a big difference between natural deserts and those humans helped create. The argument human-caused deserts should not be touched — even those that have been around for thousands of years — “does not seem logical to me,” he said. Van der Heoven readily admits the project is complex but believes it’s vital to try. “We should protect nature with all we have, but we should also restore nature with all we have,” he said. He is studying exactly which plants will be able to attract wildlife and survive future climate change impacts. He also believes changing the climate in the Sinai Peninsula will have a positive ripple effect for the region. Perhaps one of the biggest obstacles for now is regional instability as the war in Gaza continues. At the end of 2022, the Egyptian government signed an agreement to start researching and planning the restoration of Lake Bardawil. The project was scheduled to kick off this December, but conflict has slowed everything down, van der Hoeven said. He’s still confident it will happen and thinks the current situation “creates an even stronger case” for regreening as a way to help bring more opportunity and prosperity. What is clear is that climate change and biodiversity loss, two interlinked global crises, are getting worse, and in the scramble to solve them, the idea of regreening arid land is gaining currency. As with many compelling, moonshot ideas to tackle huge, complex problems, there are those who urge caution and warn of the dangerous consequences of rushing in, and there are those who argue the situation is now so urgent, there is no choice but to try them. Van der Hoeven is firmly in the latter camp. Regeneration of the natural world “is the only way out of the mess we are currently in,” he said. “There is no time anymore not to act. We should act and accept that we don’t know everything.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/weather/sahara-desert-green-climate/index.html,An unusual shift in the weather has turned the Sahara green,09-13-2024,"                                                 There isn’t much green in the Sahara Desert, but an unusual shift in the weather pattern has caused storms to move where they typically wouldn’t.                                             ","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","There isn’t much green in the Sahara Desert, but after an unusual influx of rain, the color can be seen from space creeping into parts of one of the driest places in the world. Satellites recently captured plant life blooming in parts of the typically arid southern Sahara after storms moved there when they shouldn’t. It has also caused catastrophic flooding. And scientists say a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution is making both more likely. Rainfall north of the equator in Africa typically increases from July through September as the West African Monsoon kicks into gear. The phenomenon is marked by an increase in stormy weather that erupts when moist, tropical air from near the equator meets hot, dry air from the northern portion of the continent. The focus for this stormy weather – known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone – shifts north of the equator in the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months. Much of it sags south of the equator during the Southern Hemisphere’s warm months. But since at least mid-July, this zone has shifted farther north than it typically should, sending storms into the southern Sahara, including portions of Niger, Chad, Sudan and even as far north as Libya, according to data from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. As a result, these portions of the Sahara Desert are anywhere from twice as wet to more than six times wetter than they should be. There are two potential causes for this strange shift north, according to Karsten Haustein, a climate researcher at Leipzig University in Germany. The transition from El Niño to La Niña has influenced how far north this zone has moved this summer Haustein said. El Niño – a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific – typically leads to drier than normal conditions in the wet portions of West and Central Africa. La Niña, or even a budding one, can have the opposite effect. A warming world is the other significant factor. “The Intertropical Convergence Zone, which is the reason for (Africa’s) greening, moves farther north the warmer the world gets,” Haustein explained. “At least, this is what most models suggest.” A study published in the journal Nature this June found farther northward shifts in this zone could happen more frequently in the next couple decades as carbon dioxide – a byproduct of fossil fuel pollution – levels increase and the world warms. The shift isn’t just turning deserts green, it has disrupted the Atlantic hurricane season and had major consequences over the past few months for several African countries. Countries that should be getting more rainfall are getting less as storms shift north. Parts of Nigeria and Cameroon typically get drenched with at least 20 to 30 inches of rain from July to September, but have only received between 50 and 80% of their typical rain since mid-July, according to CPC data. Farther north, typically drier areas, including parts of Niger, Chad, Sudan, Libya and southern Egypt have received more than 400% of their typical rainfall since mid-July, according to CPC data. Take the northern portion of Chad, which is part of the Sahara Desert. Only up to an inch of rain typically falls here from about mid-July to early September. But anywhere from 3 to 8 inches of rain has fallen in the same timeframe this year, according to CPC data. This excessive rainfall caused devastating flooding in Chad. Nearly 1.5 million people have been impacted and at least 340 have been killed by flooding in the country this summer, according to a United Nations briefing. Horrific flooding has also killed more than 220 people and displaced hundreds of thousands in Nigeria, mainly in the typically drier northern portion of the country, CNN previously reported. Deadly flooding also rocked Sudan in late August, killing at least 132 people and destroying more than 12,000 homes. Flooding events like these likely have the fingerprints of climate change, according to Haustein, who works on attribution studies to determine to what extent climate change has influenced a particular weather event. As the world warms, it will be able to hold more moisture, Haustien explained. This could lead to wetter overall monsoons and more devastating flooding like this season. More research will be needed to determine just how much of role climate change played in each flooding event, but it could be a sign of things to come, Haustien said. “Every single event is affected by climate change,” Haustein said. “(Even if) no single flood is (directly) caused by climate change, it has been made more likely.”"

Details on Biden’s speech were shared first with CNN. “The President will highlight how his Administration has delivered on the most ambitious climate agenda ever and restored America’s climate leadership around the world,” the White House official said in an email statement. Vice President Kamala Harris is not on the official White House schedule to appear at climate week, which is an annual event in New York that encourages global climate action and takes place alongside the United Nations General Assembly, where global leaders will gather. While there, in the final weeks of a neck-and-neck race for the White House between Harris and former President Donald Trump, Biden will draw a sharp contrast between Democrats and Republicans on energy and climate. The president will point out that Republicans voted unanimously against his climate bill, and many voted against Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law. Despite Republican opposition to the 2022 climate bill, CNN recently reported the vast majority of the hundreds of billions of dollars of announced investments has so far gone to Republican congressional districts. Many House Republicans are seeing their districts awash in jobs and cash as companies use clean energy tax credits to construct factories to build electric vehicles and their batteries, and as massive wind, solar, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel projects come online. Americans are also taking advantage of the climate law in a big way; recent Treasury Department data shows more than 3.4 million US households claimed a whopping $8.4 billion to help offset the cost of rooftop solar panels, solar water heaters, home batteries and heat pumps. In his four years in office, Biden cemented his legacy as the most pro-climate president after making the fight against climate change a central pillar of his administration. He signed billions of new clean energy tax credits and federal grant money into law in 2022 and oversaw dozens of ambitious federal regulations designed to slash pollution from US oil and gas, vehicles and power plants. Biden will be joined in New York by eight high-profile White House and administration climate and energy officials, including national climate adviser Ali Zaidi, senior adviser to the President for international climate policy John Podesta, Energy Sec. Jennifer Granholm and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael Regan. Administration officials will make a series of announcements throughout next week, focused on their work to make the US more resilient to climate impacts and giving young people more ways to secure climate and clean energy jobs."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/23/weather/helene-tropical-storm-hurricane-forecast-climate/index.html,Helene forecast to rapidly intensify and hit Florida as a major hurricane,09-24-2024,                                                 A significant storm threat is developing for the Gulf Coast with just days left to prepare.                                             ,"Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","An area of thunderstorms in the Caribbean is expected to develop into Hurricane Helene and rapidly intensify over the exceptionally warm Gulf of Mexico before slamming into the United States’ Gulf Coast later this week as a major hurricane. The storm has not formed yet but is expected to soon, so the National Hurricane Center has dubbed it Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine to warn of its imminent threat. “Strengthening is expected during the next few days, and the system is forecast to become a hurricane on Wednesday and continue strengthening on Thursday as it moves across the eastern Gulf of Mexico,” the hurricane center’s 8 p.m. advisory said. The system has a 90% chance of forming into a hurricane in the next 48 hours, according to the center. Hurricane and tropical storm watches are in effect for parts of Mexico and Cuba. A tropical storm watch was raised Monday afternoon for Florida’s Dry Tortugas and part of the Keys. Additional alerts will be issued for the US in the coming days, with a potential landfall in Florida expected perhaps as soon Thursday evening. Florida wasted no time getting preparations underway. Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm for 41 the state’s 67 counties, according to a Monday press release. The move helps to expedite preparations and coordination between the state and local governments. Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine is a disorganized mass of showers and thunderstorms churning in the far western Caribbean Sea. This stormy weather will drop potentially flooding rainfall over portions of Central America, Mexico, Cuba and Jamaica as it tries to organize into a tropical system. While its exact track and strength could change, Helene will track north over the extremely warm waters into the Gulf of Mexico which will likely supercharge it on its collision course with the US Gulf Coast. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting Helene to rapidly intensify and eventually become a Category 3 hurricane over a record-warm Gulf of Mexico – a feat becoming more likely as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Strong, potentially damaging winds and storm surge are likely near where the system ultimately comes ashore. The system will also churn up seas in the Gulf and could produce rough surf and dangerous rip currents for much of the basin, especially later this week. The National Hurricane Center is showing a landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region, but anyone from Florida’s Gulf Coast to eastern Louisiana should be on alert this week. Confidence in the system’s exact track will increase after it forms, since forecast models struggle to accurately pinpoint where it could go without a center to lock onto. Ensemble forecast models – groupings of many model runs initiated with slight differences to show a wide range of outcomes – are focusing on the eastern Gulf Coast as the area most likely for a landfall later this week. When ensemble tracks bunch closer together it means there’s more confidence in the track. There’s a closer grouping with this storm along the eastern Gulf Coast, but given it hasn’t formed yet it’s not a guarantee. Tampa General Hospital began erecting a 10-foot-high flood barrier around the facility Monday because of the chance for storm surge and shifts in the storm’s track with little time to prepare. The level one trauma center’s location next to Hillsborough Bay makes it extremely storm surge prone. It takes three days for a 60 person team to fully erect the barrier to encase the hospital and work will continue “unless we see a forecast favorable enough to stop,” Dustin Pasteur, the vice president of facilities and construction at the hospital said. “I just couldn’t afford to lose a day waiting.” Regardless of its exact track, heavy rainfall is possible for much of the Southeast starting around midweek. A level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rain is in place for much of Florida, Georgia, Alabama and parts of the Carolinas Thursday, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The system’s danger won’t end after landfall either. Helene could bring strong winds and torrential rainfall to much of Georgia and the Carolinas by Friday. This could lead to dangerous flooding and significant power outages. Helene is forecast to become the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the US this year. The three others all rapidly intensified before striking the US as hurricanes: Beryl, Debby and Francine. The last time four or more hurricanes hit the US in one season was the devastating 2020 season. Despite the rash of impactful storms, if Helene manages to landfall as a Category 3 it would be the first major hurricane to do so in the US since Idalia slammed into Florida’s Big Bend last August. Helene would continue a brutal stretch for the Sunshine State. Helene is forecast to be the fifth hurricane to slam Florida since 2022. The repeated blows have pushed the insurance market in the state to the brink, with insurers pulling out of the state because of the increasing risk of extreme weather due to climate change. CNN’s Isabel Rosales contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Part of the border between Italy and Switzerland is set to be redrawn as the glaciers that mark the boundary melt, in yet another sign of how much humans are changing the world by burning planet-heating fossil fuels.. The two countries have agreed to change the border under the iconic Matterhorn Peak, one of the highest summits in the Alps, which overlooks Zermatt, a popular skiing destination. While national boundaries are often thought of as fixed, large sections of the Swiss-Italian border are defined by glaciers and snow fields. “With the melting of the glaciers, these natural elements evolve and redefine the national border,” the Swiss government said in a statement Friday. The border changes were agreed back in 2023 and the Swiss government officially approved the adjustment on Friday. The process for approval is underway in Italy. As soon as both parties have signed, the agreement will be published and details of the new border made public, according to the Swiss government. Europe is the world’s fastest-warming continent and the impact on its glaciers has been stark. In Switzerland, they are melting at an alarming rate. The country’s glaciers lost 4% of their volume last year, second only to the record-setting 6% lost in 2022. This downward trend shows no sign of ending, said Matthias Huss, a glaciologist at the Swiss university ETH Zürich and director of GLAMOS, the Swiss glacier monitoring network. “In 2024, glaciers continued to lose ice at a high speed despite much snow in winter that was expected to bring some relief,” he told CNN. “Some glaciers are literally falling apart, small glaciers are disappearing.” Even with the most ambitious climate action, up to half the world’s glaciers may be gone by 2100. It’s causing a cascade of impacts. It makes the landscape more unstable, prone to dangerous landslides and collapses. In 2022, 11 people lost their lives when a glacier collapsed in the Italian Alps. Shrinking glaciers are leading to grim discoveries. Last year, the remains of a mountain climber who had gone missing 37 years earlier while hiking near the Matterhorn were recovered. As they recede, glaciers are also losing their vital role in contributing freshwater, which could aggravate shortages during heat waves. The shifting of national borders “is one small side-effect” of glaciers melting, Huss said. But when people can see it “directly affects our world map,” he added, it makes the immense changes of a warming world much more visible."

The expense of maintaining and upgrading the electric grid is driving up costs, particularly in the West, where fires have ravaged the grid and electric heating costs could soar nearly 23%. The price tag for heating with propane will rise 7.3% to $1,442 this winter, while natural gas users will see a 7.2% increase to $644. Natural gas prices have stabilized but are expected to rise over the winter as US exports increase, said Mark Wolfe, the association’s executive director. But those who heat with oil will catch somewhat of a break after a pricey heating season last year, with costs expected to rise only 6.1% to $1,963 this winter. A weak oil market has led to a drop in prices. While many people may think that climate change would produce warmer winters, that’s not necessarily the case, Wolfe said. Extreme cold can still occur even if winters warm overall, according to scientists. “It will be another difficult winter, coming after a difficult summer,” he told CNN.“So many families are just finishing paying their summer cooling bills.” A growing number of people are falling behind on their utility bills, the association found. Some 21 million households owed a total of $13.5 billion on their electric bills in June, up from 20.4 million owing $12.5 billion a year earlier. The drop in natural gas prices has helped decrease the total amount owed to $6.1 billion in June, compared to $7.4 billion a year earlier. But some 17.4 million households — or more than one in five — were in arrears, up from 15.2 million. What’s more, utility shutoffs are projected to have increased to 3.8 million households this past fiscal year, which ended September 30, up from 3.5 million the prior year, Wolfe said. Part of the reason more people are struggling to pay their bills is because there is less federal assistance available, he said. Congress only provided $4.1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, this past fiscal year, down from $6 billion the prior fiscal year. The association has asked lawmakers to provide $6.1 billion for the coming fiscal year, as well as an additional $1 billion for emergency assistance. “In the short term, we need to support the millions of families across the country who are struggling to keep up with monthly utility payments,” he said in a statement."

","Sam Joseph, CNN","As the climate crisis worsens, Formula One is looking for ways to pollute less planet-heating carbon and become more sustainable. Like many other sports, Formula One has committed to achieving net-zero by 2030, meaning that those behind it pledge to dramatically reduce its carbon pollution and remove from the atmosphere any that remains. In a step toward that goal, F1 teams will be required to run on 100% sustainable fuels from 2026 onwards. F1 cars already use 10% ethanol biofuel. As fans have been familiarizing themselves with terms such as “carbon neutral” over the past few years and getting to grips with what it means for the highly-polluting motorsport’s future, one type of fuel could have the potential to change the game entirely: synthetic fuel. Synthetic fuels aim to be carbon neutral, and those used in racing are made by combining carbon and hydrogen — to make hydrocarbons — just like gasoline used in cars today. The difference is, instead of using oil, which pollutes and heats the planet, the carbon in synthetic fuels is sucked from the air with filters, while the hydrogen comes from water using the process of electrolysis, powered with renewable energy sources like wind and solar. One company using that process is Zero Petroleum. Zero is producing fossil-free replicas of the base materials used in gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. Vehicles can then run on these fuels without any modifications. While Zero and synthetic fuels as a whole are stirring up a lot of excitement in motorsport, the reality is we’re not likely to see them in F1, NASCAR or IndyCar any time soon. The product is incredibly pricey – CNN Sport was told at the company’s recent Fuel Reinvented event in Bicester, England, that it was around four times more expensive than petrol – which naturally hinders the ability to make it widely available for use in motorsport. Electrolysis of water using renewable energy produces what is known as green hydrogen, but the process is expensive and requires huge amounts of renewable energy. According to BloombergNEF, the average production cost for green hydrogen in 2023 was $6.40 per kilogram. In comparison, gray hydrogen – which is made from fossil fuels – was $2.14 per kg. Hydrogen Insight reported in 2023 that the first synthetic fuel made from green hydrogen and CO2 at German car manufacturer Porsche’s Haru Oni pilot project in Southern Chile was over 100 times more expensive than petrol. Zero, however, believes that the price point will come down over the next few years as the company grows and ramps up its production levels. Bloomberg’s research suggests that the green hydrogen price could drop below its gray counterpart by the end of the current decade. “These fuels will be produced in huge quantities eventually, in a few decades,” Zero founder Paddy Lowe told CNN at the event in July. “I believe all fuels will be made in this way, and we won’t be using fossil fuels anymore at all. So that’s a very, very exciting future.” Lowe is a former motorsport engineer who boasts a wealth of title-winning experience in F1 between 1987 and 2019, serving as Chief Technical Officer at Williams, Technical Director with McLaren and Executive Director, Technical, at Mercedes. He helped to develop seven Drivers’ World Championship-winning cars; Nigel Mansell, Nico Rosberg, Mika Häkkinen (twice) and Lewis Hamilton (three times) each claimed the sport’s ultimate prize with Lowe on the team. He also has five Constructors’ Championships to his name. A self-professed “petrolhead,” the 62-year-old left the sport in 2019 to start Zero and told CNN about his excitement at being part of motorsport’s sustainability movement. “We’re here today running lots of cars, making lots of noise, burning off fuel,” he said at the Fuel Reinvented event. “I love energy, and Formula One is a sport of high energy. The problem with energy these days is it needs to be made sustainable. That’s what we all know. “I’ve just been very excited to become part of a new industry that will achieve that. And that’s a really nice counterbalance to my entire career in Formula One.” Zero may be in its relatively early stages – the company has only been in existence for four years and Plant Zero.1 in Bicester only opened its doors in 2023, but F1 has helped to build its foundations. Alongside Lowe, there are multiple former F1 engineers on the team, while 1996 world champion Damon Hill is on board as an investor. Ahead of the 2024 F1 season, Zero became an official partner of the Kick Sauber team. Sauber drivers Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu put Zero’s product to the test at the Fuel Reinvented event, taking a 1967 Lamborghini Miura and a 2024 Huracán Sterrato around a track. Diehard petrolheads and motorsport fans will be pleased to know that the fuel did nothing to affect the power or noise of the engines in contrast to quieter electric racing cars; the supercars blitzed around the track with the typical roar that fans have come to expect. Zero continued its foray into motorsport in April, linking up with 2B Autosport to become the first synthetic fuel partner in rally car racing. It also has deals outside of sport, including a partnership with the British Royal Air Force that saw both parties awarded a Guinness World Record for the world’s first successful flight using only synthetic fuel. Zero could perhaps seek to emulate P1 Fuels, a synthetic fuel firm that is already an established player in the industry. The German company’s Eco100Pro product can be legally sold at US and European fuel stations and already supplies fuel to the World Rally Championship and World Karting Championship. Other racing competitions are also already entering this space. Porsche announced this year that the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup – a one-make stock car series – would run exclusively on synthetic fuels produced at the Haru Oni plant. However, the fuels are described as only “potentially near-carbon-neutral” by the company. When the fuel regulations hit F1 in 2026, it will be working in collaboration with Aramco, a Saudi state-owned petroleum and natural gas giant and a global partner of F1, which will see sustainable fuels used in motorsport on the biggest scale so far. Lowe welcomes motorsport’s approach to sustainability and praised F1’s 2026 fuel regulations, calling the sport a “great platform for developing new technology, improving it and bringing it to general adoption.” But as the example-setting pinnacle of motorsport with significant influence over much of the racing world, how close is F1 to making its net zero target a reality? In the future, F1 says it will use carbon neutral fuels like the ones Zero produces. Per the sport, they will be created from a “a combination of non-food bio sources, genuine waste sources, or carbon extracted from the air” and will be “drop-in” fuels that do not require the engine or fuel system to be adapted. In 2023, cars in the junior Formula 2 and Formula 3 championships began using a 55% sustainable fuel mix. There are perceived moral issues over F1’s partnership with Aramco. The company has been criticized in the past for “greenwashing,” given that the majority of its production is fossil fuels. In addition, some experts suggest that electric power, a significantly cheaper alternative to synthetic fuels, would be a much more efficient way of decarbonizing the sport than synthetic fuel. But there are obstacles. Former International Automobile Federation (FIA) president Jean Todt said in 2021 that it was “simply not possible” for the championship to go all-electric in the near future due to long race distances that electric power would not have the capacity for without recharging. Furthermore, a different series, Formula E, currently holds the exclusive rights to a fully-electric single seater competition until 2039. And needless to say, F1 may face an open rebellion over the lack of engine sound from its fans, many of whom still long for the screech of the V8 units that were replaced in 2014 at the start of the turbo-hybrid era. Though changing the way that the cars are powered is undoubtedly a positive step, the sport will need to make further drastic changes if it is to hit its target by 2030. Fuel makes up less than 1% of F1’s overall carbon footprint, while logistics – such as transporting cars, parts and equipment from country to country between races – account for 49%. With the F1 calendar expanding to a record 24 races this year, reducing emissions – and quickly – will be a huge challenge. F1 is aiming to use sustainable aviation fuel and increase the use of sea freight to help bring emissions down. It also used a fleet of 18 new trucks fueled by a biofuel at nine European race weekends in 2023. According to F1’s latest impact report, the sport still has a long way to go. Emissions in 2022 were down by 13% from 2018, but still well away from its target of reducing emissions by 50% by 2030, with the remainder being mitigated through carbon offsetting – taking separate measures, like planting trees, a somewhat controversial method of compensating for CO2 being added to the atmosphere. F1 has certainly made some steps in the right direction but it remains to be seen whether it can achieve its goals before the checkered flag."

Many others have set daily high temperature records. It’s another reminder that extreme heat is no longer confined to the summer as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. “Climate change is causing the length of the heat season to increase and is making… fall heat waves like this more frequent,” Kristina Dahl, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists said. “If we continue to warm the plant by burning fossil fuels, late-season heat waves like this will become much more common.” California has been at the epicenter of the extreme heat. Palm Springs soared to 117 degrees on Tuesday and tied the all-time highest October temperature on record for the entire US. It was the hottest reading in the country this late in the year in more than 40 years. A few locations have been hotter this week than during the summer. San Jose, California, was one. Thermometers in the city topped out at 102 degrees on July 2, but hit an astounding 106 degrees on Wednesday – 5 degrees higher than the city’s previous warmest October day. The record-breaking heat began before the calendar flipped to October. Last weekend was part of a sizzling stretch of record-breaking conditions in Las Vegas and Phoenix – two cities where heat has been especially brutal this year. Five consecutive days of record-breaking September heat in Las Vegas peaked with 104 degree readings on Saturday and Sunday. It was the hottest the city has even been so late in the year. The heat was and continues to be even more severe and exceptional in Phoenix, which is in the middle of nine consecutive days of record-breaking high temperatures. The city recorded its second-warmest September day when it hit 117 degrees on Saturday, a mark never hit so late in the month. It then had its hottest October day on record Tuesday, topping out at 113 degrees. Wednesday marked the 113th day this year temperatures in Phoenix were at or above 105 degrees – another all-time record. Phoenix is in Arizona’s Maricopa County where officials say heat was responsible for more than 300 deaths this year. Hundreds of additional potential heat-related deaths are still under investigation, according to the county. Heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather and climate change is making heat waves more severe, long-lasting and possible at any time of the year. It’s especially dangerous when it fails to cool down enough overnight – another symptom of climate change. The heat has not been limited to the Southwest and California. Dozens of Colorado cities, including Denver, have set or tied all-time October temperature records since Tuesday. Denver tied its all-time October record on Wednesday when the city hit 89 degrees – the hottest it’s been this late in the year. The worst of the heat just peaked for much of the Southwest and parts of the Rockies, but seriously hot conditions will stick around through early next week. More than 30 million people in the West are still under heat alerts – including 18 million under excessive heat warnings. Nearly 200 additional high temperature records and record-warm low temperatures could be set through the weekend from California to the Rockies. “Dangerously hot temperatures will be common across many valley, mountain, and inland areas,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Thursday, underscoring the heat’s wide reach. Highs in the upper 90s to near 100 degrees are forecast in Sacramento through at least Sunday. California’s capital spent the first two days of the month mired in the July-like triple digits. Even coastal areas, often resistant to the heat, won’t escape it this time. Temperatures will gradually climb in Los Angeles through the weekend and into early next week. By Monday, a high temperature in the low 80s is possible, which could be one of the 10-warmest days of the year. Phoenix could reach two consecutive weeks of record-breaking heat as it remains stuck in it into at least midweek. And Denver will climb back into the 80s on Friday and highs will continue to surpass that threshold through at least the middle of next week. The heat will also increase the risk of dangerous wildfires – especially in California. “Dry heat like this essentially sucks moisture out of plants and turns them into dry tinder for a wildfire should a spark ignite,” Dahl explained. A heat wave baked California about a month ago and destructive fires like the Line Fire and Bridge Fire took advantage, roaring to life not long after. Santa Ana wind season typically gets underway in October and could drive fire concerns to the extreme once these violent winds meet tinder-dry conditions."

Scientists used satellite imagery and data to analyze vegetation levels on the Antarctic Peninsula, a long mountain chain that points north to the tip of South America, and which has been warming much faster than the global average.                        They found plant life — mostly mosses — had increased in this harsh environment more than 10-fold over the past four decades, according to the study by scientists at the universities of Exeter and Hertfordshire in England, and the British Antarctic Survey, published Friday in the journal Nature Geoscience.

The rate at which the region has been greening over nearly four decades has also been speeding up, accelerating by more than 30% between 2016 and 2021.

Dan Charman                                While the landscape is still almost entirely snow, ice and rock, this small, green area has grown dramatically since the mid 1980s, said Thomas Roland, a study author and environmental scientist at the University of Exeter.                        “Our findings confirm that the influence of anthropogenic climate change has no limit in its reach,” Roland told CNN. “Even on the Antarctic Peninsula – this most extreme, remote and isolated ‘wilderness’ region – the landscape is changing, and these effects are visible from space.”                                                                   Ad Feedback                                                       Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth, has recently been gripped by extreme heat events.                        This summer, parts of the continent experienced a record-breaking heat wave with temperatures climbing up to 50 degrees Fahrenheit above normal from mid-July.                        In March 2022, temperatures in some parts of the continent reached up to 70 degrees above normal, the most extreme temperature departures ever recorded in this part of the planet.                        As fossil fuel pollution continues to heat up the world, Antarctica will keep on warming and this greening is only likely to accelerate, the scientists predict.                        The more the peninsula greens, the more soil will form and the more likely the region will become more favorable for invasive species, potentially threatening native wildlife.                        “Seeds, spores and plant fragments can readily find their way to the Antarctic Peninsula on the boots or equipment of tourists and researchers, or via more ‘traditional’ routes associated with migrating birds and the wind – and so the risk here is clear,” he said.

Dan Charman                                The greening could also reduce the peninsula’s ability to reflect solar radiation back into space, because darker surfaces absorb more heat.                        These impacts would likely only be local, but could help further accelerate the growth of plant life as the climate continues to warm, said one of the authors, Olly Bartlett, a senior lecturer in remote sensing and geography at the University of Hertfordshire.                        “This iconic landscape could be changed forever,” he said.                        Matthew Davey, associate professor of physiological ecology at the Scottish Association for Marine Science, and an expert on polar plant and microbe ecology, told CNN the study was “an important progression” for understanding plant life on Antarctica.                        There could even be more vegetation than identified, said Davey, who was not involved in the research. The methods used by the scientists would mainly detect larger, greener moss fields, he said. “But we know that there are also large areas of lichens, grass and green and red snow algae that will also contribute to the vegetation area in Antarctica.”                        While the actual area increase of plant life is small, he added, the percentage rise is dramatic and it shows “the trend that vegetation is spreading, albeit slowly, in Antarctica.”                        The next stage for the scientists will be to study how plants colonize recently exposed bare land as Antarctica’s glaciers retreat further.

","Samantha Delouya, CNN","Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc across the southeastern United States in late September, causing billions of dollars in property damage. This week, another storm, Hurricane Milton, is expected to make landfall in Florida, causing even more destruction. As intensifying natural disasters threaten growing swaths of the country, assessing an area’s climate risk has become an essential part of shopping for a new home for many Americans. According to a recent Zillow survey, more than 4 out of 5 prospective homebuyers consider climate risks when they shop. Now, in a feature launched last month, Zillow will show how vulnerable properties for sale might be to extreme climate events. In partnership with First Street, a climate modeling company, the climate data shared by Zillow is divided into five categories: flood, wildfire, wind, heat and air quality. Home shoppers can explore climate risk data on Zillow’s site through color-coded maps or on individual listings. The feature not only shows a home’s risks today, but it also estimates a home’s climate risks 15 years and 30 years into the future, which are the typical lengths of fixed mortgages. In addition, Zillow said it is the only platform to offer tailored insurance recommendations alongside the risk information. “Climate risks are now a critical factor in home-buying decisions,” Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow, said in a statement. “As concerns about flooding, extreme temperatures and wildfires grow — and what that might mean for future insurance costs — this tool also helps agents inform their clients in discussing climate risk, insurance and long-term affordability.” CoreLogic, a data analytics firm, estimates that the insured losses from flooding caused by Hurricane Helene will be between $6 billion and $11 billion, while the uninsured flood losses are estimated to be between $20 million and $30 million. A growing number of home listings come with major climate risk compared to homes listed for sale five years ago, according to an August Zillow analysis. Across all new listings on the website in August, 55% carry a risk of extreme heat and one-third are at risk of extreme wind exposure. Nearly 17% of homes for sale are at major wildfire risk, 13% have an air quality risk and 13% are at risk of flooding."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Editor’s Note 10/23/24: Since this story was first published, officials in Buncombe County, North Carolina, home to Asheville, have reported they overcounted the death toll in their region by as many as 30. Some of the death toll figures in this story are no longer accurate. The exceptionally warm water of the Gulf of Mexico that supercharged deadly Helene last month was made up to 500 times more likely by human-caused climate change, which also ramped up the hurricane’s wind and rain, according to a new scientific analysis. Helene, which made landfall in Florida as a deadly Category 4 hurricane at the end of September, carved a 500-mile path of destruction across six states, causing catastrophic flooding and killing more than 230 people. Warm oceans provide a huge source of energy for storms to strengthen and grow, and the water Helene passed over before making landfall was around 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above average. These ultra-warm ocean temperatures were made between 200 and 500 times more likely by climate change, driven by humans burning fossil fuels, according to the World Weather Attribution, a network of scientists that calculates the role of climate change in extreme weather events using real world data and climate models. Climate change also worsened the extreme wind and torrential rain unleashed by Helene, making wind speeds on the Florida coast 11% more intense and increasing rainfall by about 10%, according to the analysis published Wednesday. This additional rainfall translated to “massive damages,” the study found. It created “apocalyptic scenes,” from Florida to the Southern Appalachians, said Ben Clarke, a study author and researcher at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute. Hurricanes as intense as Helene are now about 2.5 times more likely in the region, the study found. Where they were once expected every 130 years on average, they can now be expected about once every 53 years. “Climate change is a total game-changer for hurricanes like Helene,” Clarke said, adding, “if humans continue to burn fossil fuels, the US will face even more destructive hurricanes.” Wednesday’s study comes as Hurricane Milton is expected to make landfall as a major hurricane on Florida’s Gulf Coast, causing disastrous impacts less than two weeks after Helene. “The heat that human activities are adding to the atmosphere and oceans is like steroids for hurricanes,” said Bernadette Woods Placky, a study author and chief meteorologist at nonprofit research group Climate Central. More than 90% of global warming over the past several decades has taken place in oceans. Hurricanes are taking full advantage of that extra energy. Rapid intensification, when a hurricane’s wind speed increases by at least 35 mph within 24 hours, has now become more common due to climate change. Helene rapidly intensified from a Category 2 to a Category﻿ 4 hurricane just a few hours before slamming into Florida’s Big Bend region at the end of September. On Monday, Hurricane Milton became one of the most rapidly intensifying storms on record as it exploded into a Category 5 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. The impacts of these supercharged storms are extensive. Western North Carolina, hundreds of miles from the coast, experienced the deadliest impacts of Helene, with more than 100 people losing their lives. “Helene is a tragic reminder that it is not just coastal areas that are vulnerable,” said Gabriel Vecchi, co-author of the study and professor of geosciences at Princeton University. “Wetter and stronger storms pose a growing threat far inland.” Wednesday’s report follows two earlier climate analyses published last week, which also concluded fossil fuel pollution worsened Helene’s rainfall, exacerbating what would have already been a disastrous situation. Friederike Otto, WWA lead and senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said future hurricane impacts could still be minimized if the world rapidly replaces fossil fuels with renewable energy. “Americans shouldn’t have to fear hurricanes more violent than Helene,” Otto said, adding, “we need leaders who are honest about the fact that addressing climate change is inevitable if human rights are to count for something, and ensuring future generations do not have to live in a world of climate chaos.” CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller contributed to this report."

That was before October’s monster storm, Milton, struck – the destruction of which will become clear in the days to come. The science suggests Americans need to get used to more harsh weather events – extreme storms, warmer waters, wildfires and hotter weather. Evacuations and destruction will become more normal. In this case, two epic storms in two weeks. But climate change, to the extent people are talking about it, does not register this year as an “extremely important” presidential campaign issue, per a new poll. In Gallup polling from late September, most of which was conducted just before Helene made landfall, registered voters were asked to rate the importance of 22 issues in this year’s election. Just 5% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, along with slightly more than a third of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, said climate change was “extremely” important to their vote. Climate change and transgender rights were the only two of the 22 issues listed by Gallup that half or fewer of respondents said were either “extremely” or “very” important to their presidential vote choice. An issue doesn’t have to be top of mind to be potent. Transgender rights might not be the issue a majority of voters are citing as important, but it is the issue on which former President Donald Trump’s allies are focusing many of their ad dollars as they attack Vice President Kamala Harris in the final month of campaigning. Voters are most focused on the economy, with 52% of registered voters, driven by Republicans and Republican leaners, citing the economy as “extremely important” to their vote. The second-most-cited “extremely important” issue, democracy in the US, was driven by Democrats. Here are the top five most-cited “extremely important” issues for Republicans and Republican leaners in the survey: The top five for Democrats and Democratic leaners was completely different: That doesn’t mean climate change is not important to Americans. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS last December found nearly three-quarters of Americans, including half of Republicans, support policies to reduce climate pollution. In this moment when a climate change-driven disaster is disabling a portion of the country, misinformation is driving some of the conversation. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, is a climate change skeptic like Trump. She’s been spreading bonkers conspiracy theories about the origins of these storms, blaming space lasers, cloud seeding and other experimental technologies to falsely allege the government controls the weather. “Climate change is the new Covid,” she said in a post on social media, comparing the pandemic, which killed more than a million Americans, with the heating of the planet. The rest of her post alleged the government controls the weather. Greene, by the way, went to a college football game in Alabama with Trump as her state was inundated by floodwaters from Helene. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, was asked about climate change during the vice presidential debate in early October, after it was clear that Helene had caused a major disaster. Vance danced around the term – climate change – and instead admitted there are “crazy weather patterns.” He acknowledged the weird weather, which he said was more productive than getting into an argument about “weird science.” But Vance’s remedy to the so-called weird weather is counterintuitive. He said Trump’s plan to vastly increase oil production is the answer because it would bring more energy production and manufacturing jobs to the US. The Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was ineffective at drawing the obvious contrast – that the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats is already meant to kickstart American manufacturing with a pivot to a greener economy. Harris, meanwhile, has gone to great lengths to express that she does now support the practice of fracking, which climate activists oppose but which is important to the economy in the key state of Pennsylvania. In an interview with CNN in August, Harris argued the country can address the climate crisis without ending the practice of fracking. “What I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking,” she told CNN’s Dana Bash, explaining her new position. Still, admitting there is a climate crisis is a much different thing than refusing to say the words. In that recent Gallup polling, Harris had a 26 percentage point advantage over Trump when voters were asked who would do a better job addressing climate change. It was the largest spread in the poll. Trump’s advantage over Harris on his best issues, the economy and immigration, for instance, was 9 percentage points. Those are smaller advantages on issues that appear to be driving more voters."

Some of the death toll figures in this story are no longer accurate. The impact of two catastrophic hurricanes in the last two weeks has underlined that rapid climate change is a threat that can do far more damage to American lives than traditional antagonists such as terrorists and authoritarian states. The monster Hurricane Milton has left parts of Florida reeling and climate scientists are in no doubt that the strength of such storms is increased by rapidly warming oceans. This comes two weeks after Hurricane Helene significantly damaged communities like Asheville, North Carolina, hundreds of miles inland, that were seemingly immunized from the worst effects of climate change. Helene killed at least 232 people. Treating climate change as a national security problem is not a liberal position but a hardheaded realist one. Indeed, the Pentagon has explicitly said it is and “elevated” it up the lists of threats facing the US. Three years ago, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin could not have been clearer, “We face all kinds of threats in our line of work, but few of them truly deserve to be called existential. The climate crisis does.” Key US Navy bases in low-lying areas like Norfolk and Virginia Beach in Virginia are threatened by the rising waters caused by climate change, and the Pentagon is working to mitigate its impact. It’s also triggering an exodus of climate refugees who add to the chaos of conflicts around the world, for instance, in Sudan, where one of the most lethal wars on the planet today is taking place. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had a broader conception of American national security than its present, more narrow conception of freedom from attack from outside forces, according to a recent book by the historian Peter Roady, titled “The Contest Over National Security.” Roosevelt saw national security as securing the lives of all American citizens, which is why Social Security — a program that Roosevelt signed into law in 1935 — is called Social Security rather than, say, Social Welfare. Today, Social Security is one of the most popular US government programs. As the Nazis were conquering great swaths of Europe on January 6, 1941, Roosevelt spoke about his broad view of national security during his State of the Union address, emphasizing the need for “freedom from want–which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants-everywhere in the world.” It was the Cold War and competition with the Soviet Union that produced a change in how national security was conceptualized, and it took on its present narrower meaning of freedom from an attack by a competitor, according to Roady. This framing of national security also endured after the 9/11 attacks. The George W. Bush administration’s 2002 national security strategy said, “We will defend the peace by fighting terrorists and tyrants … Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the Federal Government.” Now, reframing what constitutes national security should be a top priority and it’s not just climate change that represents an existential threat.  Consider that the Covid-19 pandemic killed around the same number of Americans — 1.2 million — that had died in every war since the American Revolution. Politicians are under pressure to get serious about planning for the next pandemic enabled by the ease of global travel. According to the non-partisan COVID Crisis Group, which released a detailed report last year, the US remains quite unprepared for the next pandemic. The devastating impacts of this fall’s hurricanes may also cause American politicians to start seriously planning to mitigate the risks from climate change by, for instance, restricting new construction in flood zones. After Hurricane Milton, Americans should ask themselves: Are they safer now from threats like climate change and pandemics? And if not, isn’t it time for a real discussion of what truly constitutes national security to begin?"

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","A dramatic pattern shift is bringing the chilliest air since spring to millions of people in the central and eastern United States, making areas that have struggled so far to shed lingering warmth feel more like November than October. Extended periods of fall chill have been hard to come by for much of the country since the season began last month. But the combination of an expansive cold front and an upcoming surge of cold, Canadian air, will change that and temperatures could drop to 10 to 15 degrees below average by midweek. As of Tuesday morning, more than 60 million people from the Plains to the Appalachians and Northeast are under some sort of frost or freeze alert as temperatures drop. The first aspect of this cooldown — a far-reaching cold front — began over the weekend. This cold front swept from the north-central US through the eastern half of the US Monday, ushering in a true autumn chill for some along the way. Even chillier air from Canada will get pushed much farther south throughout Tuesday and Wednesday. Tuesday could be the coldest day of the week in Chicago, where the high temperature could struggle to reach 50. Before Monday’s high of 57, Chicago hadn’t recorded a high in the 50s since April. Temperatures will drop again on Wednesday for many areas outside the Midwest. Wednesday is likely to be the coolest day since spring for millions, and in many locations, it’ll feel more like late November than October. “Truly fall-like weather is forecast … through the start of the weekend” farther south, the National Weather Service in Atlanta said Monday. The high temperature in Washington, DC, on Wednesday could top out in the mid-50s — 10 to 15 degrees lower than normal for mid-October. Atlanta could struggle to break into the low 60s on Wednesday and remain in the 60s through Friday. The city hasn’t had a high temperature reading below 70 degrees since May and typically tops out around 75 degrees this time of year. Wednesday will also be the chilliest day of the week for large portions of the Northeast, with highs in the 40s and 50s for many. With daytime temperatures this chilly, it leaves room for overnight temperatures to possibly dip below freezing. Given the chill, a few snow flurries could dust the highest elevations of West Virginia to New York and New England Tuesday night. “Frost and freeze conditions are probable for several nights and in many areas this week,” the National Weather Service in State College, Pennsylvania, warned Monday. Frost and freeze alerts are active for millions this week and more could be issued in the coming days. Freezing conditions can kill plants that are left unprotected from the cold or end the growing season for some regional staples. These conditions are also dangerous for anyone without access to adequate heating. Freezing or-near freezing low temperatures are possible each night from Tuesday through Thursday in western North Carolina, which was devastated by Helene late last month. Temperatures will ease back to more typical October conditions late this week in much of the central US and Northeast. The chill will linger through at least Friday for areas farther south like the southern Appalachians and the Southeast. By Saturday, more seasonable highs in the 70s and 80s will return for the Southeast while 60s and 70s will be common north into the Midwest and parts of the Northeast."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","(CNN) — Striking images from the Sahara Desert show large lakes etched into rolling sand dunes after one of the most arid, barren places in the world was hit with its first floods in decades. The Sahara does experience rain, but usually just a few inches a year and rarely in late summer. Over two days in September, however, intense rain fell in parts of the desert in southeast Morocco, after a low pressure system pushed across northwestern Sahara. Preliminary NASA satellite data showed nearly 8 inches of rain in some parts of the region. Errachidia, a desert city in southeast Morocco, recorded nearly 3 inches of rainfall, most of it across just two days last month. That’s more than four times the normal rainfall for the whole month of September, and equates to more than half a year’s worth for this area. “It’s been 30 to 50 years since we’ve had this much rain in such a short space of time,’ Houssine Youabeb from Morocco’s meteorology agency told AP last week. As the rain flowed over the desert terrain, it created a new, watery landscape amid the palm trees and scrubby flora. Some of the most dramatic images are from the desert town of Merzouga, where the rare deluge carved new lakes into the sand dunes. The reflections of the town’s palm trees now shimmer across the expanse of a new lagoon, framed by steep sand dunes. The rain also filled lakes that are normally dry, such as one in Iriqui National Park, Morocco’s largest national park. NASA satellite images from the region, using false color to better highlight the floodwaters, show newly-formed lakes across swaths of the northwest Sahara. While much of the rain fell on sparsely-populated remote areas, some fell on Morocco’s towns and villages causing deadly flooding last month, which killed more than a dozen people. The Sahara is the world’s largest non-polar desert, stretching across 3.6 million square miles. Satellite images from September showed huge swaths of it carpeted in green as storms pushed further north than usual, a phenomenon some studies have linked to human-caused climate change. More extreme rainfall events could be expected in the Sahara in the future, according to recent research, as fossil fuel pollution continues to heat up the planet and disrupt the water cycle. CNN’s Brandon Miller contributed to this report."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/weather/la-nina-winter-forecast-climate/index.html,A La Niña winter is coming. Here’s what that could mean for the US,10-17-2024,"                                                 Fall is in full swing, but it’s not too soon to look ahead to winter, especially one that could feel considerably different than last year’s dominated by El Niño.                                             ","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Fall is in full swing, but it’s not too soon to look ahead to winter, especially one that could feel considerably different than last year’s dominated by El Niño. A weak La Niña is expected to develop ahead of the season and influence temperatures, precipitation, and by extension, even snow across the United States. La Niña is a natural climate pattern that influences global weather marked by cooler than average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. The effects on weather are most pronounced during the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and have a much weaker influence in the summer. Last winter was the warmest on record for the Lower 48 because it was dominated by La Niña’s counterpart El Niño in a world also warming due to fossil fuel pollution. The prolonged warmth prevented many heavy snow events in the Northeast and Midwest and created a winter snow drought measured in feet of missing snow. La Niña isn’t here yet, but has a 60% chance of emerging through November, according to the Climate Prediction Center. Once it arrives, it’ll stick around all winter and likely persist into at least early spring of next year. La Niña or El Niño are never the only factors influencing weather in a given season or location, but emphasis is placed on them because they typically have an outsized effect on winter weather in the US — especially when they are strong. While it’s still unclear just how strong La Niña will get, current forecasts favor a weaker one. The strength of La Niña matters — the stronger it is the more of a “consistent” impact it can have on weather, according to Emily Becker, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami. “A weaker event makes it more likely that other weather and climate phenomena could play the role of spoiler,” Becker wrote in NOAA’s latest La Niña/El Niño blog. The latest forecast from the Climate Prediction Center – issued Thursday – shows many of the hallmarks of typical La Niña winters and is consistent with the center’s earlier forecasts. But experts are cautioning the season could be tumultuous at times. This winter could be one filled with frequent weather changes from week-to-week rather than prolonged periods of more consistent weather, according to Jon Gottschalck, chief of the center’s operational prediction branch. “In a warming world, we continue to see weather extremes manifest in the coldest months,” Michael Morgan, NOAA’s assistant secretary of commerce for observation and prediction, cautioned Thursday. No two La Niña winters are the same, but many have temperature and precipitation trends in common. This is due to the behavior of the jet stream — essentially a river of air that storms flow through — which often shifts north during a La Niña winter. This typically shifts stormy weather out of the South and into parts of the northern US. That’s almost exactly what the Climate Prediction Center’s winter forecast shows for December through February. Large portions of the northern US are expected to end up wetter than normal this winter, especially the Pacific Northwest and Midwest. Wet weather will be crucial to combat ongoing dryness and drought in the Midwest. It’s a complete flip from last winter’s pattern, which favored a wetter South and a drier North. More precipitation than normal doesn’t guarantee there will be more snow. Temperatures still have to be chilly enough both above and at the surface for snow to fall and stick to the ground. Weak La Niña events tend to allow for more snow in the Northeast, while snow is more limited during stronger La Niñas because warmer temperatures often creep farther up the East Coast. If this year’s La Niña ends up rather weak, this outlook could shift. Still, the latest winter temperature forecasts from the center aren’t ideal for snow lovers in the Northeast. The season is expected to be warmer than normal across almost the entire southern half of the US and much of the East. This could mean some winter storms in parts of the East end up wetter, rather than snowier. But with drier and warmer than normal conditions expected across the South, drought conditions could worsen throughout the season. Parts of the Midwest, Plains and Rockies could end up with temperatures closer to normal this winter while cooler than normal conditions are expected from the Pacific Northwest to parts of the Dakotas. The combination of wetter and cooler than normal conditions could potentially mean more snow for the Pacific Northwest, an area where a significant snowpack is crucial to tourism in the winter and the water supply for the warmer months. Northern California is typically wetter during a La Niña winter, but the Climate Prediction Center’s forecast keeps the region near normal this season. La Niña had a hand in the extremely wet winter much of the state endured from December 2022 to February 2023 and during the wet winter before that. Southern California is expected to be drier and warmer than average – typical for La Niña. It’s crucial the region gets a period of soaking rain in the next few months; wet weather is needed to shut down wildfire season. Without enough rain, fires could continue to burn through the overabundance of fire fuels like grasses or brush available this year."

","Olesya Dmitracova, CNN","For consumers still scarred by jumps in their energy bills in recent years, the International Energy Agency has good news: Oil and natural gas prices will probably be lower over the next five years. Energy prices soared in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which followed a rise in global demand as economies reopened after Covid lockdowns put lives on hold. Oil and natural gas supplies will increase in the second half of this decade, as long as the conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s war in Ukraine don’t derail current trends, Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said Wednesday. And that “would move us into a very different energy world from the one we have experienced in recent years during the global energy crisis,” he added in a statement accompanying the IEA’s latest World Energy Outlook report. “It implies downward pressure on prices, providing some relief for consumers that have been hit hard by price spikes.” While the report strikes a positive note, it also calls for faster transition to clean energy, not only to address the climate crisis but also to ensure global energy security threatened by geopolitical tensions. European benchmark natural gas futures reached a closing price of €339 ($370) in August 2022, more than eight times their current level, and they are still far above pre-pandemic prices. Brent oil prices, the global benchmark, are closer to their pre-Covid levels but they have risen in the past month as violence in the oil-producing Middle East has widened. But global oil output has been increasing, thanks mostly to producers in the United States and other countries in the Americas. For natural gas, the IEA expects “a huge new wave” of the fuel in liquefied form to come to market in the next five years, mostly from the US and Qatar, Birol told CNN. The IEA projects an “overhang” of oil and liquefied natural gas supply during the second half of the 2020s, alongside a glut of manufacturing capacity for some key clean energy technologies such as solar panels and batteries. Combined with a “major comeback” for nuclear power generation in many countries, “the stage is set for a buyer’s market,” Birol told CNN. The forecast downward pull on fossil fuel prices might be good news for consumers’ pockets, but whether it will also help climate change action, as the IEA hopes, will largely depend on what governments do next. “The breathing space from fuel price pressures can provide policymakers with room to focus on stepping up investments in clean energy transitions and removing inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” Birol said in the statement. One example of such pressures is the hundreds of billions spent by European governments since September 2021 to shield consumers from rising energy costs. “This means government policies and consumer choices will have huge consequences for the future of the energy sector and for tackling climate change,” Birol added. Investing in green energy isn’t just necessary to prevent a climate catastrophe — as burning fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change — it also makes financial sense, the IEA suggests in its wide-ranging report. “Many clean energy technologies are already the most affordable options when lifecycle costs are considered,” the agency wrote. “While their upfront costs in many cases are higher than those of their conventional equivalents, they often have much lower operating costs because they are more efficient. They also shield consumers from volatility in fossil fuel prices.” At the same time, extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and droughts, intensified by climate change, have damaged energy infrastructure, led to power outages and disrupted energy supply chains, causing temporary price surges, the IEA said. Such costs are expected to rise, especially if global temperatures climb sharply, it added. The energy body reiterated its previous forecasts that demand for oil, natural gas and coal will peak by the end of the decade. But it warned that “the world is still a long way from a trajectory aligned with its net zero goals.” Scientists say worldwide greenhouse gas emissions must go down to zero by 2050 on a net basis — taking account of all the pollution produced and removed from the atmosphere — in order to keep global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Based on today’s policies, the world is on track for a rise of 2.4 degrees in global average temperatures by the end of the century, the IEA said."

Water evaporates from the ground — including from lakes, rivers and plants — and rises into the atmosphere, forming large rivers of water vapor able to travel long distances, before cooling, condensing and eventually falling back to the ground as rain or snow. Disruptions to the water cycle are already causing suffering. Nearly 3 billion people face water scarcity. Crops are shriveling and cities are sinking as the groundwater beneath them dries out. The consequences will be even more catastrophic without urgent action. The water crisis threatens more than 50% of global food production and risks shaving an average of 8% off countries’ GDPs by 2050, with much higher losses of up to 15% projected in low-income countries, the report found. “For the first time in human history, we are pushing the global water cycle out of balance,” said Johan Rockström, co-chair of the Global Commission on the Economics of Water and a report author. “Precipitation, the source of all freshwater, can no longer be relied upon.” The report differentiates between “blue water,” the liquid water in lakes, rivers and aquifers, and “green water,” the moisture stored in soils and plants. While the supply of green water has long been overlooked, it is just as important to the water cycle, the report says, as it returns to the atmosphere when plants release water vapor, generating about half of all rainfall over land. Disruptions to the water cycle are “deeply intertwined” with climate change, the report found. A stable supply of green water is vital for supporting vegetation that can store planet-heating carbon. But the damage humans inflict, including destroying wetlands and tearing down forests, is depleting these carbon sinks and accelerating global warming. In turn, climate change-fueled heat is drying out landscapes, reducing moisture and increasing fire risk. The crisis is made more urgent by the huge need for water. The report calculates that, on average, people need a minimum of about 4,000 liters (just over 1,000 gallons) a day to lead a “dignified life,” far above the 50 to 100 liters the United Nations says is needed for basic needs, and more than most regions will be able to provide from local sources. Richard Allan, a climate science professor at Reading University, England, said the report “paints a grim picture of human-caused disruption to the global water cycle, the most precious natural resource that ultimately sustains our livelihoods.” Human activities “are altering the fabric of our land and the air above which is warming the climate, intensifying both wet and dry extremes, and sending wind and rainfall patterns out of kilter,” added Allan, who was not involved in the report. The crisis can only be addressed through better management of natural resources and massive cuts in planet-heating pollution, he told CNN. The report’s authors say world governments must recognize the water cycle as a “common good” and address it collectively. Countries are dependent on each other, not only through lakes and rivers that span borders, but also because of water in the atmosphere, which can travel huge distances — meaning decisions made in one country can disrupt rainfall in another. The report calls for a “fundamental regearing of where water sits in economies,” including better pricing to discourage wastefulness and the tendency to plant water-thirsty crops and facilities, such as data centers, in water-stressed regions. “The global water crisis is a tragedy but is also an opportunity to transform the economics of water,” said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director general of the World Trade Organization and a co-chair of the commission that published the report. Valuing water properly is essential, she added, “so as to recognize its scarcity and the many benefits it delivers.”"

The temperature inside his house hovered just above the freezing mark. Kottler’s family goldfish froze in its tank. He made it through Uri safely, but more than 200 Texans died during the rare cold outbreak, which knocked power out for days.

He made it through Uri safely, but more than 200 Texans died during the rare cold outbreak, which knocked power out for days. Now, Kottler’s company, Pattern Energy, is set to build the first major transmission line connecting Texas with the Eastern US electrical grid – something that would have helped get more life-saving electricity into the state during that storm. “When something like winter storm Uri happens, you could be bringing power from the Southeast, and there’s plenty of power that they could export into Texas,” Kottler told CNN. That transmission line is just one example of what US officials and energy experts say the US desperately needs more of: towering, high-voltage electrical lines to move large amounts of power from one place to another. This ability to get electricity from one part of the country to another is ever more important as America’s grid is lashed by increasingly extreme weather.

Experts fear it may never recover,10-24-2024,"                                                 Damming, over-extraction, pollution and, increasingly, the human-caused climate crisis are driving the decline of the Caspian Sea. Some experts fear it’s being pushed to the point of no return.                                             ","Laura Paddison, CNN","There’s a spot on the shoreline from where Azamat Sarsenbayev used to jump into the brackish, blue-green Caspian Sea. Only a decade later, it now overlooks bare, stony ground stretching toward the horizon. The water has receded far and fast from the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan, where the eco-activist has lived his whole life. “It is very difficult to watch,” he said. More than 1,000 miles to the south, near the Iranian city of Rasht, Khashayar Javanmardi is alarmed. The sea here is choked by pollution. “I cannot swim anymore … the water changed,” said the photographer, who has traveled the Caspian’s southern shore, documenting its decline. Both men feel intimately connected to the water they grew up alongside. Both are terrified for its future. The Caspian Sea is the planet’s largest inland sea and its largest lake, an enormous body of water roughly the size of Montana. Its looping coastline stretches more than 4,000 miles and is shared by five countries: Kazakhstan, Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan. These countries rely on it for fishing, farming, tourism and drinking water, as well as its coveted oil and gas reserves. The Caspian also helps regulate this arid region’s climate, providing rainfall and moisture to Central Asia. But it’s in trouble. Damming, over-extraction, pollution and, increasingly, the human-caused climate crisis are driving its decline — with some experts fearing the Caspian Sea is being pushed to the point of no return. While climate change is raising global sea levels, it’s a different story for landlocked seas and lakes like the Caspian. They rely on a delicate balance between water flowing in from rivers and rainfall and leaving through evaporation. This balance is changing as the world warms, causing many lakes to shrink. People don’t need to look far to see what the future might hold. The nearby Aral Sea, straddling Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, was once one of the world’s largest lakes but has all but disappeared, devastated by a combination of human activities and the escalating climate crisis. Over many thousands of years, the Caspian Sea has swung between highs and lows as temperatures fluctuated and ice sheets advanced and retreated. In the past few decades, however, the decline is accelerating. Human activities play an important role, as countries build reservoirs and dams. The Caspian is fed by 130 rivers, although around 80% of the water comes from just one: the Volga, Europe’s longest river, which winds through central and southern Russia. Russia has built 40 dams, with 18 more in development, according to Vali Kaleji, an expert on Central Asia and Caucasian Studies at the University of Tehran, reducing the flow of water entering the Caspian Sea. But climate change is playing an increasingly significant role, increasing evaporation rates and fueling more erratic rainfall. Caspian Sea water levels have been falling since the mid-1990s, but have sped up since 2005, dropping by about 5 feet, said Matthias Prange, an Earth systems modeler at the University of Bremen in Germany. As the world warms further, levels are set “to drastically fall,” Prange told CNN. His research predicts declines of 8 to 18 meters (26 to 59 feet) by the end of the century, depending on how quickly the world cuts fossil fuel pollution. Another study suggests drops of up to 30 meters (98 feet) are possible by 2100. Even under more optimistic global warming scenarios, the shallower, northern part of the Caspian Sea, mostly around Kazakhstan, is set to completely disappear, said Joy Singarayer, a paleoclimatology professor at the University of Reading, and the study’s co-author. For Caspian Sea countries, this is a crisis. Fishing grounds would shrink, tourism would decline, and the shipping industry would suffer as vessels struggle to dock in shallow port cities like Aktau, the University of Tehran’s Kaleji said. There would be geopolitical ramifications too. Five countries competing for diminishing resources could culminate “in a race to extract more water,” Singarayer said. It could also set up new conflicts over oil and gas reserves, if shifting coastlines push countries to make new claims. The situation is already disastrous for the Caspian Sea’s unique wildlife. It’s home to hundreds of species, including the endangered wild sturgeon, the source of 90% of the world’s caviar. The sea has been landlocked for at least 2 million years, its extreme isolation resulting in the “emergence of bizarre creatures such as very strange cockles,” Wesslingh told CNN. But receding water is depleting oxygen levels in its depths, which “might wipe out the remaining survivors of millions of years of evolution,” he told CNN. It’s “a massive crisis that almost no one knows about.” It’s a crisis too for Caspian seals, an endangered marine mammal found nowhere else on Earth. Their haul-out sites in the shallower northeastern Caspian Sea are shifting and disappearing, as the animals also struggle against pollution and overfishing. Aerial surveys show huge reductions of seals, said Assel Baimukanova, a researcher at the Institute of Hydrobiology and Ecology in Kazakhstan. Scientists counted 25,000 at one haul-out site on the Durnev Islands in the northeast Caspian Sea in 2009. “By the spring of 2020, we did not observe a single individual,” she told CNN. There are few easy solutions to this crisis. The Caspian Sea is in a region that has experienced a lot of political instability, and is shared between five countries, each of which will experience its decline in different ways. No one country is to blame, but if they fail to take collective action, there could be a repeat of the Aral Sea disaster, Kaleji said. There is no guarantee the Caspian “will return to a natural and normal cycle,” he added. Rising concern about the Caspian’s fate comes at a time of heightened scrutiny on the region. Next month, global leaders will gather in Azerbaijan’s coastal capital city Baku for COP29, the United Nations’ annual climate summit, where they will discuss climate action in the shadow of the oil rigs dotted across this part of the Caspian Sea. In August, the country’s President Ilham Aliyev said the Caspian Sea’s decline was “catastrophic” and becoming an ecological disaster — but at the same time the country plans to expand its own production of the fossil fuels that are helping drive it. Back in Kazakhstan, Sarsenbayev is trying to draw attention to the Caspian’s plight through beautiful, sweeping footage he posts on Instagram. If the climate crisis and water over-extraction continue unabated, he fears “the Caspian Sea may face the fate of the Aral Sea.” In Iran, Javanmardi, continues to photograph the Caspian coastline, documenting the polluted water, shrunken shores and desiccated sea beds, as well revealing the beauty that still exists and the connections people have to the sea. He wants people to wake up to what’s disappearing. “This is the biggest lake in the world,” he said, “all people should consider it as something important.”"

It’s a warning of what’s to come,10-25-2024,"                                                 Extreme weather has thrashed the United States this year with more flood emergencies than any other year — a deadly, sobering statistic that scientists say paints a picture of the future as the planet warms.                                             ","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Extreme weather has thrashed the United States this year with more flood emergencies than any other year — a deadly, sobering statistic that scientists say paints a picture of the future as the planet warms. An unprecedented 91 flash flood emergencies have been issued by the National Weather Service this year, more than any other year since this most-dire language was first used in 2003. All flash flood warnings are a sign of a very dangerous situation, but flash flood emergencies are the most rare – accounting for around 1% of flash flood warnings since 2019 – for a reason. “It’s the ultimate tool in our toolkit,” said Kate Abshire, a hydrologist and leader of the weather service’s National Flash Flood Services. “It’s a tool to amplify the idea that there’s an extreme threat to life and property and the potential for catastrophic damage.” The warnings are just one measure of how chaotic and devastating flooding has been so far this year. It has killed dozens of people, altered entire landscapes and cost the United States billions of dollars. The most recent flash flood emergency unfolded in Roswell, New Mexico, last weekend. The desert city received about half a year’s worth of rain in just 24 hours. Roadways turned into raging rivers under the cover of darkness Saturday evening. Hundreds were trapped and rescued and at least two people were killed. It was exactly the kind of extreme rainfall event scientists expect as the planet warms. The most intense rain events are getting heavier and more frequent as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. A warmer atmosphere is capable of soaking up more moisture like a sponge and wringing it out in the form of gushing rainfall. As a result, “we most definitely are” already seeing the consequences of climate change reflected in this year’s catastrophic flash flooding events, according to Astrid Caldas, a senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Extreme rain events have been happening a lot more and are likely to continue to happen a lot more,” Caldas continued. Development around waterways and in mountainous areas is also putting people in harm’s way and increasing the risk for catastrophic, life-threatening flooding disasters, Caldas, who specializes in community resilience, explained. “It’s about where we build, how we change the natural ways of the water” Caldas said. “Water is always going to go the easiest way that it can, so the fact that we have built so much, particularly along the banks of rivers … that’s why flooding events are also increasing in the US.” The final tally of flash flood emergencies fluctuates greatly year-to-year and is highly dependent on changing weather patterns and tropical systems that impact the US. Tropical systems are fueled by an immense amount of moisture to begin with, which they often unleash in the form of some of the most intense possible bouts of rainfall. That’s been the case this year. Rainfall from hurricanes Debby, Francine, Helene and Milton accounted for about half of all flash flood emergencies issued this year, according to a CNN review of archived warnings. Helene dumped never-before-seen rainfall amounts of up to 30 inches in western North Carolina and caused catastrophic flood damage that left many locales unrecognizable. Helene accounted for more than 30 flash flood emergencies on its own this year; there were 29 total flash flood emergencies last year. Like all heavy rain events, tropical systems are also being supercharged in a warming world. They’re also getting an added boost from extremely warm bodies of water like the Gulf of Mexico which not only help them to rapidly intensify, but also inject additional moisture into the atmosphere. Oceans are heating up as temperatures trend upward around the globe. The Gulf of Mexico spent a large portion of the summer and early fall at record-warm levels, acting like rocket fuel for tropical systems. All of the hurricanes to hit the US this year were fueled by the Gulf. Increasing extreme weather as result of climate change also helped to create a flood disaster. The South Fork and Salt fires torched thousands of acres of southern New Mexico in the early summer, burned hundreds of homes and businesses and killed at least two people. Heavy rain then pounded the scorched area not long thereafter and triggered multiple flash flood emergencies. Because the ashen soil, stripped of its ground cover, was less capable of absorbing rainfall, it became a raging river of water and debris that caused more damage. This fire-to-flood disaster was just one varietal of dozens of such disasters this year. All told, there have been at least 45 flood-related major disaster declarations this year, according to FEMA. And two dozen billion-dollar extreme weather disasters have already occurred in the US in 2024, CNN previously reported, a number that is straining FEMA’s disaster relief funding. Flood-related disasters will only continue to increase as the atmosphere and oceans warm and combine to create a potent cocktail capable of creating a new normal. “The past does not predict the future anymore,” Caldas warned. CNN’s Ella Nilsen contributed to this report."

As of October 25, the  average precipitation across the Lower 48 was less than an inch. Only five months in the 129 years of records have ended with less than an inch of average precipitation over the Lower 48. But an upcoming pattern flip could change things as the nation’s weather seesaws from one extreme to the next – a telltale sign of the increasing weather extremes as the planet warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Hundreds of locales are experiencing one of the driest Octobers on record with dozens pacing for the driest, including some that haven’t received any measurable rain. This October will likely end as the driest on record for New York City, Philadelphia and tied for the driest in Atlanta. It could be the first month in Philadelphia dating to the 1800s without measurable precipitation. Only a few drops have fallen, not nearly enough to hit the 0.01-inch requirement to be considered measurable. Philadelphia hasn’t measured rain since late September and its 30-plus day dry stretch without it is the city’s longest such streak on record. The same is true for Atlanta. The city typically gets a little over 3 inches of rain in October but hadn’t received a drop of rain until sporadic sprinkles tracked through the area Wednesday. Like Philadelphia, it still hasn’t received measurable rain. A few places, particularly in the Central US, only had their dry streaks broken this week. New York recorded just 0.01 of an inch of rain on Tuesday, breaking a lengthy dry spell in a month when just over 4 inches typically falls. Some places have swung from one extreme to the next. Hurricane Helene ravaged the southern Appalachians with up to 30 inches of rain at the end of September and created catastrophic flooding that reshaped the region forever. But the same area hasn’t recorded an inch of rain in October. Florida is a notable exception to the intense dryness, but it came at the expense of another extreme: torrential, flooding rainfall from Hurricane Milton. Milton dumped so much rain in the Tampa area that parts of the region will have their wettest October on record. Tropical systems like Milton are getting more intense and unleashing heavier rainfall as the world warms. Persistent high pressure dominating the eastern half of the US for much of October was a force field against wet weather and also caused temperatures in parts of the East and Midwest to feel more like summer than the peak of fall at times. The combination of little-to-no rain and abnormally warm temperatures caused a flash drought to emerge in parts of the US and for drought conditions to dramatically worsen across the Lower 48. Flash drought happens when drought conditions increase quickly, rather than over a multi-month or yearly timeframe, according to NOAA. About 30% of the Lower 48 had at least moderate drought as October began. That figure is now 54% at the monitor’s latest update Thursday. Only about 11% of the country had moderate drought conditions or worse in early summer, so the increase over the fall and October alone has been astounding. Just over 87% of the Lower 48 is at least abnormally dry – the most widespread this lowest level on the drought monitor has been in nearly two years. The drought in a handful of states is the most significant in more than two decades. More than half of New Jersey is experiencing severe drought after starting the month with none. It’s the state’s worst drought level since 2002. In nearby Delaware, nearly the entire state is in severe drought, also the worst since 2002. Severe drought is also happening in about 15% of Pennsylvania, the worst since 2002. The expanding and worsening drought has serious implications for agriculture and transportation. Levels on the Mississippi River are so low that shipping loads must be constrained, the Associated Press reported Tuesday. The river is a critical transportation pipeline, especially for agricultural products, and this is at least the third year in a row it’s had water level issues. Sixty percent of the water that flows into the lower Mississippi River comes from the Ohio River, where drought is rampant. Drought is also plaguing the upper portion of the Mississippi River. Dry and abnormally warm conditions also ramped up wildfire danger in areas not typically associated with these kind of blazes in fall. Multiple wildfires in Michigan, New Jersey and Massachusetts have burned at least 100 acres each in the past week alone, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. November looks to be the start of a much wetter period for the US. Outside of the West Coast, nearly the entire Lower 48 is likely to have wetter than normal conditions in early November, according to the Climate Prediction Center’s latest forecast. For some parts of the East, a wetter November could start as soon as the month begins on Friday as a cold front swings through the region. After that, a batch of widespread rain and storminess could develop in the central US over the weekend and persist into early next week, including on Election Day. Some of this wet weather could shift into the East around midweek."

","Analysis by Bill Weir, CNN Chief Climate Correspondent","“Everybody complains about the weather, but no one does anything about it,” Mark Twain used to quip, back when humans had only just begun digging fossil fuel out of the ground and burning it for energy. It was a borrowed joke — and good thing for Twain, since it hasn’t aged well. Nearly a century and a half after “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” was published, humanity’s fossil fuel pollution is changing nearly everything about our weather, and with early voting underway, American voters are making a stark choice over what to do about it. Thousand-year floods are obliterating communities with staggering regularity; hurricanes are getting stronger faster and beating coastlines with more brutal wind and surge; the heat is so extreme that first responders are filling body bags with ice as a last-ditch effort to save people from heat stroke. At the current rate of ecosystem collapse, scientists predict 1.2 billion people will become climate refugees by 2050, while over a million species of plants and animals are on the brink of extinction. Even for voters untouched by flood, fire or drought, the crisis is driving up the cost of food, insurance and supply chains for everyone. Their tax dollars are now pouring into billion-dollar efforts to keep the Earth we know from heating beyond salvation, while other ventures race to adapt our built environments to more violent physics. Property values, insurance rates and building codes are changing, and experts are warning that unnatural disasters like Hurricane Helene are just the opening acts of an existential threat. Looking back through time, it’s hard to imagine a more severe or consequential gap between candidates on a single issue. If Lincoln had lost in 1860, or Reagan dismissed the Soviet threat, the American experiment might have ended, but most life on Earth wouldn’t have noticed. Now, scientists are warning humanity has run out of time to deal with an existential, global threat. One of the candidates wants to do something about it. The other has said the human-caused climate crisis is “a hoax.” “The science is clear,” Vice President Kamala Harris said at an event in 2022. “Extreme weather will only get worse, and the climate crisis will only accelerate.” She cast the tie-breaking Senate vote for the most ambitious climate laws in the nation’s history, designed to supercharge the transition to clean energy and save Americans money on their energy bills, new appliances and at the gas pump. It included credits for appliances that lower your energy costs and a big credit on solar panels so homeowners can start generating their own energy, rather than paying power companies’ increasing prices. In the three years since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, American clean tech companies have attracted hundreds of billions in additional private investment, dozens of clean energy projects have broken ground and the number of Americans using federal incentives to buy more efficient cars and appliances has exceeded expectations. Harris plans to “work to lower household energy costs and create millions of new jobs, while tackling the climate crisis, protecting public lands and public health, and holding polluters accountable to secure clean air and clean water for all,” her campaign website says. She also intends to “safeguard America’s energy security.” If elected to a second term, former president Donald Trump is vowing to undo it all on day one, methodically rolling back pollution limits on tailpipes, power plants and methane after pulling the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement for the second time. He could also go a step further — as some of his former aides have suggested he should do — and pull the US out of the entire global negotiating framework, ending official US climate diplomacy. Former Trump administration officials have outlined the speed at which they intend to dismantle the progress the Biden administration made on climate change. “We lost a fair amount of time early in the Trump administration because we weren’t as prepared as we would be for round two,” Mandy Gunasekara, former chief of staff of the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump, told CNN’s Ella Nilsen this summer. His former Interior Secretary David Bernhardt told Nilsen the climate rollbacks could happen “very quickly” and “in a matter of months, in many instances.” Gunasekara and Bernhardt are among the authors of Project 2025 — a conservative playbook for a second Trump administration. Trump has publicly distanced himself from the ideological blueprint, but CNN found at least 140 authors worked in the Trump administration. But given the momentum of the clean energy train, some experts and analysists doubt that Trump would be able to derail it entirely. “I wish it wasn’t so intolerably uncertain what’s going to happen (in this election),” former Vice President Al Gore said in May. “But if (Trump) were to win, I think it would be difficult for him to roll back the Inflation Reduction Act.” As the first man to run for President on a climate platform, and win the popular vote doing it, Gore believes one of the Biden Administration’s best decisions was to spend more than 75% of the IRA money in Republican districts. Bill Gates also has confidence in the direction of America’s climate action, but worries about the pace and the message a second Trump presidency would send to the rest of the world. “Stop and go, for things that involve 20- or 30-year plant investment, just scares the whole industry away from a country that’s inconsistent,” Gates told CNN. After founding Breakthrough Energy almost a decade ago, the man who made Microsoft now invests in hundreds of companies devoted to climate solutions at scale, some of which benefit from tax incentives built into Biden’s climate law. While the green trend in economics now has Republican states like Texas leading the nation in clean energy installations, Germany, Japan and China got there first. “So now, we’re hoping that a lot of those federal incentives survive,” Gates said, “so these new industries aren’t born in some other country.” A Harris win next week won’t refreeze Greenland or weaken hurricanes, but it would continue Democrats’ climate momentum at a time scientists say is Earth’s most critical moment. Trump’s plan is to undo that progress, throw billions of dollars of clean energy investment out the window and give other countries the economic opportunity, instead. Voters will decide the path America will take. “The vote is (like) a pistol,” Mark Twain also wrote. “You may seldom or never draw it, but when your life is in danger you will see that it is a valuable thing to have.”"

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Halloween may be over, but hurricane season still has a few unsettling tricks left in its final month. Three tropical trouble spots bear watching in the Atlantic basin in the coming days as a strange hurricane season continues to defy expectations. One of these trouble areas is located in the western Caribbean and has a high chance of developing into a tropical depression late this weekend or early next week, according to the National Hurricane Center. Once it develops, it could strengthen into a tropical storm. But exactly when and where a tropical depression develops in the coming days will have major implications for where it could go next. The next tropical storm to form will be given the name Patty, followed by Rafael and Sara. It’s still too early to know the exact track the potential storm could take, but the system could drift toward the Gulf of Mexico. Drenching rainfall and perhaps some gusty winds are likely in the western Caribbean, parts of Central America and Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula next week. The US Gulf Coast could finally have some atmospheric protection on its side after multiple devastating hurricane strikes this season. Storm-disrupting upper-level winds are expected to set up over the Gulf next week and could tear any system that makes it into the region apart. Two other areas could develop in the next week. Stormy weather that brought record-breaking rain to Puerto Rico Thursday and was drenching parts of the northeastern Caribbean Friday has a slim window to organize into a tropical system as it slides westward in the coming days. Regardless of development, it could bring additional flooding rainfall to Puerto Rico and to the Virgin Islands and Hispaniola through the weekend and into next week. The other area is located in the open Atlantic and while it has a medium chance for development, it is unlikely to be a threat to land. Hurricane season typically winds down in November, but this year has already proven itself to be anything but typical. This season is above average in terms of named storms, hurricanes and major – Category 3 or stronger – hurricanes. Five hurricanes struck the US this year despite the season taking a big break, and confounding experts, during what should have been the busiest part of the year. So it’s no surprise this November looks likely to continue the trend. While November storms do form, they do so much less frequently overall and ones that hit the US are exceptionally rare. At least 125 tropical storms and hurricanes have roamed the Atlantic in November since the late 1800s, according to data from NOAA. Ninety-eight percent of named storms make landfall in the US before November, according to hurricane expert Michael Lowry. Storms that form in November tend to do so in the Caribbean and in the southwestern and central parts of the Atlantic where warm water persists longer and storm-disrupting winds tend to be weaker. The Gulf of Mexico isn’t a common source of tropical trouble in a typical November because storm-disrupting winds get stronger over the area in the late fall. For something tropical to form and stay active in the Gulf, it would likely need a boost provided by extremely warm water. The Gulf isn’t as hot as it was when it fueled Helene and Milton, but it’s still warmer than average for November. Beyond development chances in the next few days, the Caribbean could remain a tropical hotspot into the back half of November, according to the Climate Prediction Center. Hurricane season officially ends on November 30, but tropical systems aren’t bound by that date. Around two dozen tropical storms and hurricanes have roamed the basin in December since the late 1800s."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/weather/tropical-storm-rafael-hurricane-climate/index.html,Tropical Storm Rafael forms in the Caribbean and could threaten the US Gulf Coast,11/05/2024,                                                 A rare November tropical threat could impact the United States over the weekend amid an unusual and relentless hurricane season that shows no signs of letting up.                                             ,"Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","Tropical Storm Rafael formed in the Caribbean Sea Monday afternoon and could bring a rare November threat to the United States this weekend after tearing through parts of the western Caribbean. Rafael is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane Tuesday and could rapidly intensify over the warm water of the northwest Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center. It’ll slam Cuba Wednesday and then emerge into the Gulf of Mexico. From there, the storm’s ultimate path and intensity in the Gulf and potentially along the US Gulf Coast is difficult to pinpoint with confidence because the system has just formed and is still several days away from reaching the area. “It is too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could bring to portions of the northern Gulf Coast,” the National Hurricane Center said, adding in its 10 p.m. update that predicting the storm’s path “remains a challenge.” Anyone from the US Gulf Coast to the northeastern Mexico coast will need to monitor updates closely. Despite the uncertainty, tropical alerts were issued for the Florida Keys Monday afternoon, adding to alerts already in place in Cuba, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. Early forecasts from the hurricane center show the system’s center reaching the US Gulf Coast later this weekend, anywhere from the Florida-Alabama border to Louisiana. But this area could shift dramatically in the coming days while the system tracks through the Caribbean. The drastic differences between two major forecast models on the storm’s track once it enters the Gulf of Mexico highlight the forecast uncertainty. One depicts Rafael making landfall in western Cuba, then tracking generally to the northwest before making landfall somewhere between Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle. The hurricane center’s forecast looks rather similar to this scenario. But another model is showing the potential for Rafael to make an abrupt left turn once it gets into the open Gulf. From there it tracks generally to the west and could fall apart entirely or make landfall in northeastern Mexico or the western Gulf Coast instead. Any shifts will have a significant impact on the flood threat from the storm in Florida and other parts of the Southeast. The storm is enhancing rainfall ahead in these areas ahead of its potential arrival there. This means any areas that do get rain from the storm later this week or weekend will face an increased flood threat. Five hurricanes have made landfall on the Gulf Coast this year, but this storm seems unlikely to be as severe as hurricanes Helene and Milton because its strength could be hampered by the terrain of Cuba and hostile storm-disrupting winds over the Gulf. Tropical activity typically winds down in November, but the month still occasionally produces a storm. However, US landfalls are exceptionally rare as 98% of named storms make landfall in the US before November, according to hurricane expert Michael Lowry. The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30. While the threat the system poses to the US is still uncertain, its threats early this week in the Caribbean are much clearer. The bulk of the system’s storminess was over the Caribbean Sea late Monday, while drenching rain had already begun in parts of Hispaniola and Jamaica. The Cuban government changed hurricane and tropical storm watches to warnings Monday night, the US hurricane center said, adding the Cayman Islands are under a hurricane warning. The system could bring torrential rainfall and flash flooding to more of the western Caribbean over the next few days. This heavy rainfall could also lead to mudslides, especially in the mountainous terrain of Jamaica and southern Cuba. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected for Cuba and Jamaica. Heavy rain will spread into Florida and areas of the Southeast US by mid to late week. The lower and middle Florida Keys could see 1 to 3 inches of rainfall. Showers and thunderstorms were affecting most parishes in Jamaica while strong, gusty winds were blasting parts of the southern parishes, the country’s meteorological service said in its 8 p.m. ET update. All in-person classes are canceled Tuesday in Jamaican schools, according to CNN affiliate Radio Jamaica News. Rafael will also deliver strong, potentially damaging winds, especially once it reaches hurricane strength Tuesday. Tropical storm-force winds will reach Jamaica overnight Monday or early Tuesday morning and expand to west-central Cuba and the Florida Keys on Wednesday. Hurricane-force winds will roar over parts of the Cayman Islands by Tuesday afternoon and western Cuba on Wednesday. These powerful winds will also churn up nearby seas and produce storm surge. Up to 3 feet of storm surge could inundate parts of the Cayman Islands, while up to 9 feet of dangerous surge is possible in western Cuba. Saltwater flooding for oceanside portions of the Florida Keys could reach up to a foot above recent high tides on Wednesday, according to a statement from the Key West office of the National Weather Service. It also said “a few tornadoes” were possible. CNN Meteorologist Robert Shackelford contributed to this report."

","Samantha Delouya, CNN","Last month, two major storms, Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, caused a total of between $51.5 billion and $81.5 billion of property damage, mostly to Southeastern US states, according to estimates from CoreLogic. That’s a lot of damage – but it’s only a small fraction of what climate change has cost people around the world. A new report is flashing a warning signal about climate change and natural disasters, finding that their total economic damage has skyrocketed into the trillions. The report from the International Chamber of Commerce, which comes as the United Nations Climate Change Conference begins in Azerbaijan this week, estimated that the total cost of damage from climate-related extreme weather events globally was approximately $2 trillion between 2014 and 2023 – roughly in line with the economic toll of the 2008 global financial crisis. The ICC, the largest business organization in the world, promotes international trade and investment. In the report released on Sunday, the group said it aims to push governments and businesses to accelerate policies that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which directly contribute to global climate change. “Just as the global financial crisis was met with a swift and concerted response from world leaders, we need governments to understand that the economic impact of climate change necessitates a response of similar speed and decisiveness,” said John W.H. Denton AO, the secretary general of the ICC, in a statement to CNN. The ICC’s report was released less than a week after Donald Trump was reelected as US president. Trump has promised to undo climate regulations in the country, including rolling back pollution limits on tailpipes and power plants. During his last term, Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Agreement, arguing that it placed an unfair economic burden on Americans. The ICC report assessed nearly 4,000 weather events across six continents in the last decade, combining both the direct monetary toll from the destruction of homes, businesses and infrastructure and the impact of extreme weather on human productivity. It found that approximately 1.6 billion people were affected by these weather events, and the report argues that the toll will only intensify over time: There has been an 83% increase in recorded climate disasters between 1980-1999 and 2000-2019, according to the ICC. In 2022 and 2023, economic damages reached $451 billion, a 19% increase compared to the annual average from the previous eight years, the report found. “The data from the past decade shows definitively that climate change is not a future problem: the productivity losses from extreme weather events are being felt in the here and now by the real economy,” Denton said. Separate data released last week by Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service confirms that the world will likely surpass a grim milestone this year: 2024 is likely to be the hottest year on record."

Climate diplomats gathering for talks Monday are just as anxious.                                             ","Angela Dewan and Ella Nilsen, CNN","America’s allies and foes alike have spent the past five days speculating about what Donald Trump’s re-election will mean for their economies, security and the world’s grinding wars. Similar anxieties are brewing among diplomats gathering in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, on Monday for the COP29 climate talks — and for good reason: Trump has vowed to again pull the United States from the Paris Agreement, which binds nearly all the world’s countries to dramatically slash carbon pollution. Instead, he is poised to revive his “drill baby, drill” agenda to cash in on more American oil and gas. As the Biden administration winds down, it is racing to send climate and environment funds to states and buttoning up last-minute regulations aimed at protecting the planet, one of its top climate officials said Monday. “We still have plenty of work to do, and we have around 72 days, I think, to get it done,” said John Podesta, a senior White House adviser on clean energy who is also leading the US delegation at the UN climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. Speaking to reporters at Baku on Monday, the first official day at COP29, Podesta said the Biden administration is “fully committed” to obligating outstanding funding under Biden’s climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The current administration has other major things left on its to-do list, including finalizing California’s federal waiver to set its own emissions standards and completing a federal review on US exports of liquified natural gas. A U-turn on US climate policy could be disastrous for the planet, as it raises the risk of emulation. When America does something on the world stage, at least some countries tend to follow. “Paris is one of those agreements where you need a critical mass of economic powers and emitters, past and present, to actually be able to address this challenge,” said Oli Brown, an associate fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, negotiators will ramp down their expectations in terms of what’s possible at the talks, he said. “And it will allow big emitters to not take the kind of ambitious action that’s needed, because they don’t want to be at a competitive disadvantage to the US, if the US is unburdened by any sense of collective responsibility,” he told CNN. The sheer amount of extra carbon pollution from an America unbound by any climate agreement is worrying enough. America is the second-biggest polluter of planet-heating carbon and it produces more oil than any other nation. But the real sting is, that as the world’s biggest economy, the US has more power than any other country to fund climate change action in the developing world. Even if it stays in the Paris Agreement, an “America First” Trump administration is unlikely to be more generous with grants and loans for other countries’ green transition. That alone sets the talks up for failure — their main aim was to agree to a transfer $1 trillion a year from wealthy countries and institutions to help developing nations build clean energy systems and to adapt to worsening extreme weather, like heat waves, floods, drought, storms and wildfires. The COP29 talks were already shaping up to be lackluster. It’s the third year in a row that they’ve been held in a petrostate. Mukhtar Babayev, a state-oil company veteran, will preside over the event. More striking than the list of leaders making opening remarks is the list of those who won’t bother going at all: US President Joe Biden, France’s Emmanuel Macron, European Union chief Ursula Von Der Leyen and even Claudia Sheinbaum, the climate scientist-turned-president of Mexico. A number of leaders who were scheduled to go have since pulled out. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz canceled his appearance after his fragile three-way coalition government collapsed last week. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof withdrew to deal with his own domestic crisis, as violent clashes erupted in Amsterdam around a football match contested by Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who will host the climate talks next year in Brazil, bowed out after a head injury. There will be few powerful leaders to send Trump any kind of warning shots on climate. A surprise presence at the talks will be officials from the Taliban as observers, Reuters reports, marking a rare appearance by the group at a multilateral event since seizing control of Afghanistan in 2021, after the US’ chaotic withdrawal. For the planet, the timing of Trump’s win and wider global chaos couldn’t be worse. The year 2024 will almost certainly end as the hottest on record. Back-to-back hurricanes supercharged by unprecedented ocean heat have killed more than 300 people in America this season alone. The worry now is that with so little steam and an absent US, other countries may consider exiting Paris too. Jonathan Pershing, who served as deputy climate envoy at the start of the Biden administration, however, says the worst outcome is more likely a hit to America’s reputation on the global stage for flip-flopping on its promises. He pointed out that it took a whole year for the Biden administration to regain the trust of its allies on climate after Trump’s previous withdrawal from the agreement. “It’s a depressing story,” he said. “It’s a consequence of the United States, which has exercised a leadership role, abdicating that role.” Another concern among climate advocates has been that an absent US climate leader would open the door for China to step in and gain more global influence. China is rapidly shifting its credentials as a major problem to the climate to one of its biggest solutions. It’s building wind and solar farms at a blistering pace – faster than any other country on the planet – and selling them to all corners of the globe. The country is constructing nearly two-thirds of the world’s utility-scale solar and wind power. The European Union will have to step up, too to fill the void left by the US. “I like to think about global climate politics as a tricycle: the EU, China and the US,” said Li Shuo, director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “You need at least two wheels to function at any given time. We just missed one wheel, and we need the other two to roll and carry us on.” That’s what happened in Trump’s first term. America’s traditional allies simply waited it out and reengaged with the US after he lost the 2020 vote. But in 2024, there’s a greater sense of urgency, and climate inaction for another four years is a more dangerous prospect in a world with even more instability. At the end of this year, the world will be at the mid-point of what science shows is a crucial decade for turning the tide on climate change. Fossil fuel pollution must be halved over that 10-year period to have any hope of avoiding crashing through the 1.5-degree warming threshold, beyond which humans will struggle to adapt. The world is already 1.3 degrees warmer than it was before humans started burning fossil fuels at an industrial scale. Even if all the countries in the Paris Agreement cut carbon pollution by as much as they have pledged, at best they could limit warming to 1.9 degrees, according to a recent UN report. Their actual actions put the world on course for 2.3 degrees of temperature rise. As climate scientists so often say, every fraction of a degree matters. Extreme heat waves that occurred once in every 50 years at the start of the 20th century with 1 degree of global warming, for example, now occur once every 10, said Joeri Rogelj, a climate professor at Imperial College London. At 1.5 degrees, a similar heat wave would happen once every six years, and at 2 degrees, it would be every four. “So, something that for our great-grandparents was a unique extreme weather event, a once-in-a-lifetime challenge to deal with, will now become pretty much a regular occurrence at 2 degrees of warming,” Rogelj told CNN. That might not be a huge problem for people who work in air-conditioned offices and homes, and who travel around in air-conditioned cars, but for poorer communities and those in developing countries, it’s an especially stressful future to imagine. “If you’re working outside, engaged in heavy physical activity, and you live in homes that are poorly insulated, and you don’t have necessarily the financial means to pay for the additional energy for cooling, you will experience this heat very differently,” Rogelj said. “It’s clear that it will hit the poorest and most vulnerable segments of our population the hardest.”"

","Ella Nilsen, CNN","The Environmental Protection Agency just finalized one of the Biden administration’s only outstanding climate rules, aimed at cracking down on leaks of methane — a potent planet-warming gas with an outsized impact on the climate. The rule, proposed nearly a year ago, was mandated by the Inflation Reduction Act, which could make it more difficult for the second Trump administration to dismantle. The new rule charges high-emitting oil and gas producers a fee for wasting methane above a certain threshold by venting or flaring it into the atmosphere instead of capturing it. The methane fee will be charged by the federal government until the companies fix the leaks. This fee was paired with financial incentives for oil and gas companies to fix leaky pipelines or infrastructure. Methane is an odorless and invisible gas that has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide. Methane is the main component of the gas that heats our homes and powers our stoves, and it’s one of the main byproducts of oil and gas drilling. It’s also dramatically warming the planet. An international body of scientists has concluded that the concentration of methane in the atmosphere is higher now than any time in at least 800,000 years. It’s responsible for as much as a third of the global warming the planet has experienced so far, according to the EPA. The rule could prove tricky for the incoming Trump administration to overturn because the program was included in Biden’s climate law, which passed Congress in 2022. Undoing it would take another act of Congress; while not impossible if Republicans take the House of Representatives, it could be an uphill climb and take longer than if the Trump administration were acting on its own. “EPA has been engaging with industry, states, and communities to reduce methane emissions so that natural gas ultimately makes it to consumers as usable fuel instead of as a harmful greenhouse gas,” EPA administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. According to the EPA, this rule alone would prevent 1.2 million metric tons of methane from polluting the atmosphere – the equivalent of taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year."

","Hanna Ziady, CNN","Shell is not obliged to dramatically reduce its planet-heating pollution by 2030, a Dutch appeals court ruled Tuesday, delivering a blow to efforts by environmental activists to push energy companies away from fossil fuels. The ruling — handed down just as annual climate talks take place at COP29 in Azerbaijan’s capital Baku — overturns a previous verdict that imposed steep carbon emissions reductions on the British oil and gas giant. “We are pleased with the court’s decision, which we believe is the right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company,” Shell (SHEL) CEO Wael Sawan said in a statement. Shell had appealed the previous ruling, handed down in 2021, which ordered the company to slash its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. That included emissions from its own operations and from the energy products it sells. While The Hague Court of Appeal ruled that Shell is obliged to limit its CO2 emissions — in order to protect the planet from dangerous climate change — it said there is insufficient agreement in climate science on a specific reduction percentage that an individual company such as Shell should adhere to. As such, it dismissed the previous ruling. Tuesday’s ruling noted that Shell is already working to reduce emissions from its own operations — so-called scope 1 and 2 emissions — and that forcing the company to reduce the far greater emissions caused by the use of its products, known as scope 3 emissions, would not be effective. “A court ruling would not reduce overall customer demand for products such as petrol (gasoline) and diesel for cars, or for (natural) gas to heat and power homes and businesses,” Shell said. Friends of the Earth Netherlands, an environmental campaigning group that brought the case against Shell, expressed disappointment with the outcome. “This hurts,” said director Donald Pols. At the same time, he highlighted several positives from the ruling. “The court affirmed that companies… are responsible for the human rights violations resulting from climate change,” he told CNN. “The judge also stated that the more than 800 fossil fuel projects (in Shell’s pipeline) are contradictory to its responsibility to act in accordance with human rights principles. These are all very important legal principles that… can be used in future court cases.” Pols said Friends of the Earth Netherlands would study the ruling before deciding whether to launch an appeal at the Supreme Court of the Netherlands. Joshua Sherrard-Bewhay, an analyst at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said Shell’s successful appeal “signals to high emitters that they are safe for now from the jurisdiction of international frameworks,” citing the Paris Agreement, which binds nearly all countries to drastically cut carbon pollution, as one example. Despite the initial ruling ordering Shell to slash its emissions, the energy giant has in fact watered down some of its climate targets as it seeks to boost financial returns and amid concerns globally about secure and affordable energy. Earlier this year, the company said it would target a 15-20% reduction in the so-called net carbon intensity of its energy products by 2030 compared with 2016, having previously aimed for a 20% cut. It also scrapped an objective to almost halve its net carbon intensity by 2035. At the same time, Shell has pledged to halve emissions from its own operations by 2030 and to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, meaning its greenhouse gas emissions must go down to zero by mid-century, taking account of all the pollution it produces and removes from the atmosphere. Shell continues to invest much more into fossil fuels than it does into clean energy. Last year, it invested $5.6 billion into low-carbon energy, amounting to 23% of its total capital spending. By comparison, it poured more than $16 billion into its oil and gas businesses. According to Friends of the Earth Netherlands, Shell accounts for 3% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, more than most countries emit individually. Addressing the ruling’s implications for COP29, Pols said international climate agreements will be ineffective at combating climate change if they exclude, as the Paris Agreement does, large corporate polluters. He noted that since 2015, when that accord was signed, about 50 companies had emitted 80% of global CO2 pollution. “It is as if the negotiations between governments have not adapted to the new economic and geopolitical reality of multinationals,” he added. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, a group that aims to compel major energy companies to reduce emissions through shareholder votes at their annual meetings, said the ruling intensifies investors’ responsibility to “reform Big Oil.” “The court’s decision… is a setback in the fight against the climate crisis,” he added. This story has been updated with additional information."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Global levels of planet-heating pollution from fossil fuels will hit record levels this year, according to new projections, dashing hopes 2024 would be the year they plateau or fall. Fossil fuel pollution is set to rise to 37.4 billion metric tons this year, an increase of 0.8% from 2023, a report found. Global emissions from coal, oil and gas are all projected to increase. The news comes as global leaders gather at the COP29 UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan — talks which have been overshadowed by anxiety over what a new Trump administration will mean for global climate action. The urgency is clear, however, this year is “virtually certain” to be the hottest on record, and has seen back-to-back hurricanes, catastrophic flooding, devastating typhoons and severe drought. “The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly dramatic, yet we still see no sign that burning of fossil fuels has peaked,” said Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate professor at the University of Exeter, who led the study, published Tuesday by the Global Carbon Project, a consortium of scientists. While fossil fuels make up the bulk of planet-heating pollution, the other main source is land-use change, including deforestation. Those emissions are also set to go up in 2024, according to the report, exacerbated by this year’s severe droughts and fires. There was some more positive news: emissions are set to decline in the US and Europe, and China’s emissions are slowing, and could even see a decline this year, the research projected. But that progress is offset by increases in much of the rest of the world, including India. Total global climate pollution will reach 41.6 billion metric tons this year, up from 40.6 billion metric tons last year, according to the report. The increase may not seem huge, but it puts the world way off track for tackling the climate crisis. A UN report published in October said global carbon emissions were slowly plateauing and had raised the possibility they could fall this year. Fossil fuel pollution needs to roughly halve over this decade to keep global warming lower than 1.5 degrees Celsius, a threshold countries have pledged to try to stay below in the Paris climate agreement. Climate change is already having catastrophic impacts. But scientists warn that at 1.5 degrees, it begins to exceed the ability of humans and the natural world to adapt — including potentially triggering devastating climate tipping points. Humanity has already lived through 12-month periods above this critical climate limit but scientists are more concerned about longer timeframes. Tuesday’s study estimates that at current rates of emissions, there is a 50% chance the world will breach 1.5 degrees consistently in about six years. Some companies and governments have emphasized carbon removal as a key way to bring global temperatures down, but current technology is only removing around one-millionth of the carbon pollution produced by fossil fuels, the report found. “Time is running out,” Friedlingstein said, adding, “world leaders meeting at COP29 must bring about rapid and deep cuts to fossil fuel emissions.”"

Tropical activity should be winding down in November, but this will be the third named storm this month instead thanks to exceptionally warm water wrought by climate change. For now, it is Tropical Depression Nineteen with 35 mph maximum sustained winds and is located 65 miles east of the Honduras/Nicaragua border in the Caribbean Sea, according to the NHC. The storm will strengthen as it meanders and nearly stalls over the very warm water of the western Caribbean Sea — the same body of water that fueled Hurricane Rafael — and will be a tropical storm while near the northern coast of Honduras over the weekend. Tropical storm alerts have been issued for parts of Honduras and Nicaragua, with the storm’s wind and rain expected to arrive as soon as Thursday evening and ramp up Friday. The storm will bring “life-threatening” flooding rainfall up to 30 inches to Honduras and double-digit rainfall totals to other parts of Central America, the NHC warned. That could mean “widespread areas of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides.” It will then threaten Belize and the Yucatán Peninsula with storm surge and gusty winds by early next week, so residents should prepare. The potential impacts on the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Florida Keys, and Cuba, remain uncertain, and those in these areas should closely monitor forecasts because the forecast becomes extremely uncertain beyond this weekend. There are a few potential scenarios on the table for how formidable the storm could be and whether it could reach the US next week. They all hinge on how close Sara gets to the coast of Honduras over the next few days. The official forecast from the hurricane center has the system skimming along the coast of Honduras over the weekend, but this could change. If it makes landfall in Honduras this weekend and moves far enough inland, it could deteriorate while over land, cut off from the warm water fueling it. This scenario would bring strong winds and torrential rain to Central America, but could keep the storm away from the US entirely or have it approach as a very weak storm. If Sara remains very close to the coast of Central America, but briefly moves over land, it could eventually emerge in the southern Gulf of Mexico next week as a weak, but slightly stronger storm than in the first scenario. This scenario would lessen the blow if it were to reach the US. It would still unleash life-threatening flooding rainfall in Central America and head for dangerous strike on Belize and Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula But if the system stays far enough away from the coast and over the Caribbean’s tremendously warm water, it could strengthen considerably — and possibly rapidly intensify. This would bring more substantial impacts to Central America, the Yucatán and Belize and a much more troubling forecast for the US. Sea surface temperatures in the Caribbean are currently their second-warmest on record — just behind 2023’s record-breaking heat. They’re warmer than they should be at the peak of hurricane season and could continue to produce unusually strong storms. Warmer bodies of water are fueling stronger storms and more rapid intensification as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Sara could make a gradual turn to the northwest after it exits Central America, head for a powerful strike on the Yucatán and potentially reach the eastern Gulf of Mexico as a much stronger storm that could make a run at Florida next week. The Gulf is record-warm for this time of year and likewise could boost or sustain any system that reaches it. All scenarios are still possible, but forecast models are starting to agree that the storm will get much closer to the Honduras coast than initially thought Wednesday, making the more troubling scenario less likely. Five hurricanes have slammed into the US Gulf Coast this year. If this system were to make landfall in the US, it could challenge the latest landfalling hurricane on record. The current record rests with Hurricane Kate, which made landfall as a Category 2 storm in Florida on November 21, 1985. Hurricane season officially comes to an end on November 30, but named storms have formed in December in the past."

It’s a season that’s lived up to initial hyperactive forecasts and hasn’t played by the rules. Tropical activity should be winding down in November, but Sara is now the third named storm this month thanks to exceptionally warm water wrought by climate change. The storm, which briefly made landfall Thursday night in northeastern Honduras, may make another brief landfall as it skirts the coast. Sara’s ongoing heavy rainfall could trigger “life-threatening” flooding in parts of Honduras, the NHC warned. A few places in Honduras could measure around 30 inches of rain while double-digit rainfall totals may impact other parts of Central America. That could mean “widespread areas of life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides.” After pushing away from Honduras later this weekend, Sara will threaten Belize with storm surge and gusty winds. Tropical storm alerts were in effect from Honduras to Guatemala and Belize Thursday. Additional alerts for more of Belize and Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula are possible in the coming days. Multiple scenarios for what could happen to Sara after its interaction with Honduras and the Yucatán Peninsula were possible earlier this week, but one appears to be winning out and it’s good news for a storm-weary US Gulf Coast that’s been hit by five hurricanes this year. Sara will likely undergo too much interaction with land in Central America and Mexico to survive into the Gulf of Mexico early next week as originally forecast, the NHC said Thursday afternoon. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam contributed to this report."

President-elect Donald Trump is out on a limb within even his own party as he vows to the kill clean energy tax subsidies that automakers, the fossil fuel industry and Republican lawmakers have become increasingly amenable toward over the past two years. “We need to look at the IRA, and instead of taking a sledgehammer to it, take a scalpel to it,” Republican Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia told CNN. “There are some good parts … There are parts of it that do make sense.” The “good parts” for Republicans are the hundreds of billions of dollars being funneled into clean energy projects, the overwhelming majority of which are going to Republican districts. Close to 80% of the $243 billion-worth of projects that are either completed or under construction are in GOP districts. The same goes for another $435 billion in clean energy projects companies have announced but have not yet built, according to an exclusive CNN analysis of data from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The data shows Biden’s climate law has had a profound impact on the American economy in its first two years, said Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium Group, a nonpartisan thinktank. But with Trump gunning to repeal the law and Congressional Republicans looking for ways to offset new tax cuts next year, the $435 billion in new, not-yet-built projects is increasingly vulnerable. “If that investment was to dry up, it would significantly impact the economic prospects particularly of the rural and manufacturing communities where most of that investment has been flowing,” Houser told CNN. In other words, if Republicans successfully repeal Biden’s climate and clean energy law, their districts stand to lose the most. Carter is far from the only Republican angling to defend the clean energy funds against Trump. He’s one of 18 House Republicans who signed a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson this summer strongly urging Johnson to not repeal the climate law. “A full repeal would create a worst-case scenario where we would have spent billions of taxpayer dollars and received next to nothing in return,” Republicans wrote in the letter, adding they had heard from industry and constituents “who fear the energy tax regime will once again be turned on its head due to Republican repeal efforts.” Some Republicans on that letter lost their races for reelection to Democrats, but Carter told CNN there are “enough” lawmakers who share the view “to make a difference” when it comes time to vote. “I don’t think it has to be many,” he said. “Obviously, we don’t have a big majority and it’s going to be very tight.” Biden’s climate law is a manufacturing bill by design, reopening dormant plants and opening new ones to build electric vehicles and their batteries. The bill also has generous subsidies for wind and solar farms, nuclear power, and newer industries like hydrogen and carbon capture, which aims to scrub climate pollution out of smokestack exhaust before it reaches the atmosphere. Carter’s Georgia district is home to a massive Hyundai EV and battery production plant that was funded by the IRA and is now open. Hyundai spent nearly $7 billion to build the plant, which is expected to create over 8,000 jobs. The district of North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson — the head of House Republicans’ campaign committee — has seen more investment than any other, thanks to a colossal Toyota car battery plant being built there. Rhodium and MIT data shows Toyota has already pushed more than $8.2 billion into building the factory and has pledged to spend $5.7 billion more as it plans to triple the factory’s size. “Those facilities are going to be creating a lot of jobs and economic growth,” said Adrian Deveny, founder of consulting firm Climate Vision and a former top Senate staffer who led the IRA clean energy negotiations. “If you have legislation that repeals the tax credits, those facilities are going to stop construction, or they’ll never even start construction.” The bill also contained billions in consumer subsidies to help millions of households save money on solar panels, electric vehicles, appliances and home insulation. The conventional wisdom among many experts is these consumer subsidies could be more vulnerable to Republican repeal efforts than the industry money, but subsidies like the EV tax credits help drive demand for electric vehicles – necessary to keep factories in GOP districts open. “The extent to which (House Republicans) fight to save the EV tax credits, I think really will come down to what are they hearing from those automakers about how important those tax credits are for those manufacturing facilities to be able to continue,” Houser said. Conservative groups and companies who are using the clean energy tax credits are already starting to lobby lawmakers to save them. “The need to explain what the tax credits do, particularly in the long run, is incredibly important,” Heather Reams, the president of the right-leaning nonprofit Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, told CNN. “To demonstrate that these tax credits are really a net profit for the economy, that really is the name of the game.”"

The urban heat island effect means that city temperatures can be several degrees higher than nearby rural regions. That’s because materials like concrete and asphalt absorb and radiate heat. Vehicles and air-conditioning units expel heat, and towering buildings block wind flow.                        Officials across the globe are trying to cool cities down. In Chicago, which has a history of fatal heatwaves, more than 500 rooftops have been covered with vegetation, which releases cooling water vapor and acts as natural insulation for the building. Los Angeles, which has a vast network of freeways, has painted some of its roads with a solar-reflective material.

That became clear to entrepreneur Jay Sadiq soon after he founded a startup in Abu Dhabi to modify asphalt to absorb less heat, when a potential client encouraged him to identify the hottest parts of the city, where the material would be most beneficial.                        Sadiq couldn’t find the level of granular data he needed, so he started working on harnessing the information himself. Today, his company FortyGuard is focused on leveraging data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide a detailed view of urban temperature dynamics.                        He hopes that it will enable urban planners, chief heat officers, businesses, and real estate developers to make data-driven decisions, and residents to better plan their lives.

Global heat-related mortality for people aged 65 and older increased approximately 85% between 2017 and 2021.                        As billions of people move to urban areas in the coming decades, between half and three-quarters of the global population could be exposed to life-threatening extreme heat and humidity by 2100, according the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Although urban heat is gaining more attention, most weather stations haven’t been built to specifically address the issue, and they’re often located at an airport or atop a hillside – areas that aren’t representative of the temperature on a city sidewalk.                        “Historically, most meteorological agencies would be tasked with monitoring the weather at scales larger than cities,” says James Voogt, a professor in the department of Geography and Environment at the University of Western Ontario, who is an expert in urban climatology.                        Satellites that measure surface temperature can cover wide areas but can’t provide detailed information about neighborhood hotspots. And trees and tall buildings can block satellites from recording temperatures at ground level. “It doesn’t see the shade underneath,” says Voogt.                        Some cities have started collecting information using sensors mounted on streetlights or buses, and others, including Hong Kong, have deployed dense urban meteorological networks. “But not many cities have such a dense measurement network,” says Chao Ren, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Hong Kong, who specializes in applied climatology and climate design.                  Urban heat tech                    FortyGuard, which today has 16 employees and offices in Abu Dhabi and San Jose, California, collects 32 billion data points daily from third-party providers, but Sadiq says he can’t reveal much about their sources, given market competition.                        It then uses AI to produce models that take into account variables that impact how temperature is felt – including a city’s elevation, vegetation, water bodies, and atmospheric conditions, such as cloud cover, to give a fuller view of local temperature dynamics, he says. “Our approach goes beyond measuring air temperature at a specific point in time,” Sadiq adds.

In late September, US real estate website Zillow announced that its listings would feature information such as wildfire risk, air quality and heat.

In September, Google announced a new Heat Resilience tool, which applies AI to aerial and satellite images to help cities deal with extreme heat.                        Voogt and Ren said that it’s difficult to comment on FortyGuard’s urban heat intelligence without knowing more about its data sources, validation methods and technology. “The key element is how such AI is being trained and on what,” says Voogt.                        But there is “definitely a need and demand for high spatial resolution temperatures in urban environments,” he adds.                        Ren said what’s most important about urban heat information is how it will be used. While interest in urban heat is increasing, some places are doing better than others at addressing it, by educating residents about the issue, creating warning systems, or incorporating mitigation considerations into building codes or city planning.                        “The question is really, who will be the end user of your data, and who will put such urban heat information into their practices?” she says.                                                                                Climate change is impacting urban areas especially hard, and densely populated cities are suffering the most. The urban heat island effect means that city temperatures can be several degrees higher than nearby rural regions. That’s because materials like concrete and asphalt absorb and radiate heat. Vehicles and air-conditioning units expel heat, and towering buildings block wind flow. Officials across the globe are trying to cool cities down. In Chicago, which has a history of fatal heatwaves, more than 500 rooftops have been covered with vegetation, which releases cooling water vapor and acts as natural insulation for the building. Los Angeles, which has a vast network of freeways, has painted some of its roads with a solar-reflective material. But detailed information about urban temperatures is scarce. That became clear to entrepreneur Jay Sadiq soon after he founded a startup in Abu Dhabi to modify asphalt to absorb less heat, when a potential client encouraged him to identify the hottest parts of the city, where the material would be most beneficial. Sadiq couldn’t find the level of granular data he needed, so he started working on harnessing the information himself. Today, his company FortyGuard is focused on leveraging data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide a detailed view of urban temperature dynamics. He hopes that it will enable urban planners, chief heat officers, businesses, and real estate developers to make data-driven decisions, and residents to better plan their lives. Extreme heat can cause heat-related illnesses and death, particularly for vulnerable groups like young children and the elderly. Global heat-related mortality for people aged 65 and older increased approximately 85% between 2017 and 2021. As billions of people move to urban areas in the coming decades, between half and three-quarters of the global population could be exposed to life-threatening extreme heat and humidity by 2100, according the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Rising temperatures also makes it harder to sleep at night, and difficult to be productive during the day, especially for outdoor workers. Although urban heat is gaining more attention, most weather stations haven’t been built to specifically address the issue, and they’re often located at an airport or atop a hillside – areas that aren’t representative of the temperature on a city sidewalk. “Historically, most meteorological agencies would be tasked with monitoring the weather at scales larger than cities,” says James Voogt, a professor in the department of Geography and Environment at the University of Western Ontario, who is an expert in urban climatology. Satellites that measure surface temperature can cover wide areas but can’t provide detailed information about neighborhood hotspots. And trees and tall buildings can block satellites from recording temperatures at ground level. “It doesn’t see the shade underneath,” says Voogt. Some cities have started collecting information using sensors mounted on streetlights or buses, and others, including Hong Kong, have deployed dense urban meteorological networks. “But not many cities have such a dense measurement network,” says Chao Ren, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Hong Kong, who specializes in applied climatology and climate design. FortyGuard, which today has 16 employees and offices in Abu Dhabi and San Jose, California, collects 32 billion data points daily from third-party providers, but Sadiq says he can’t reveal much about their sources, given market competition. It then uses AI to produce models that take into account variables that impact how temperature is felt – including a city’s elevation, vegetation, water bodies, and atmospheric conditions, such as cloud cover, to give a fuller view of local temperature dynamics, he says. “Our approach goes beyond measuring air temperature at a specific point in time,” Sadiq adds. Some of the company’s most robust information is about certain US cities, allowing it to model urban temperature for each 10 square meters, with 89% accuracy, according to Sadiq. FortyGuard offers advisory services, and it has worked with clients like Masdar City, an experimental “sustainable city” in the United Arab Emirates, to help it pinpoint heat hotspots to add trees and water features. But the startup, which is “about to about to close a large funding round,” is aiming to position itself as a technology company, says Sadiq.

","Kevin Liptak, CNN","When President Joe Biden worked to burnish his climate legacy in the Brazilian Amazon on Sunday, the unspoken presence of Donald Trump shadowed the historic stop. A sitting American president had never before set foot in the Amazon rainforest, and Biden wanted to use his presence in the vital environment to bring attention to his efforts curbing carbon emissions and helping the world guard against global warming. Standing on a dirt path with lush palms and other foliage behind him, Biden described the fight against climate change as a “defining” part of his presidency. But he also warned future administrations that undoing that work would risk depriving the world of its benefits. Without naming President-elect Trump, who has questioned whether climate change exists and vowed to reverse Biden policies on gas and oil exploration, Biden delivered a clear message to the country as he prepares to make way for the incoming Republican president. “I will leave my successor and my country a strong foundation to build on if they choose to do so. It’s true, some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that’s underway in America. But nobody, nobody can reverse it. Nobody,” Biden said in remarks from Manaus, Brazil. “Not when so many people regardless of party or politics are enjoying its benefits. Not when countries around the world are harnessing the clean energy revolution to pull ahead themselves. The question now is: Which government will stand in the way and which will seize the enormous economic opportunity?” he continued. Before he spoke, Biden viewed dried-up river beds and wildfire damage on an aerial tour of the Amazon rainforest, getting a bird’s-eye view of some of the effects of a yearslong drought. The half-hour tour aboard Marine One brought Biden to the confluence of the Rio Negro and Amazon rivers, where he saw ships that had been grounded due to low water levels, and over a wildlife preserve. Among the moves he announced Sunday were tens of millions in US dollars directed toward preserving the Amazon, whose trees act as a sponge for massive amounts of carbon dioxide and which is being threatened by deforestation. And he pledged billions to help nations bolster resilience against climate change. But whether any of the money makes it out the door will now largely be up to Trump, who has dismissed climate change — and who, a day before Biden’s trip, named a fracking industry executive as his pick for energy secretary. Trump has already vowed to withdraw again from the Paris climate accord, which Biden entered back into when he took office four years ago. Trump and his team have pledged to ease restrictions on oil and gas exploration that Biden put in place. And the president-elect has cast a deeply skeptical eye toward foreign assistance of the type Biden announced Sunday. That dynamic has led to skepticism among world leaders gathered for summits in South America this month that any of Biden’s announcements will last past January, when he exits the world stage. The stakes of the Amazon’s fate could hardly be higher. Aside from its role absorbing planet-warming gasses, the rainforest accounts for a major portion of the world’s biodiversity and is home to Indigenous populations."

People will lose their homes and possibly loved ones.                                             ","Alaa Elassar and Leigh Waldman, CNN","John Towsen and his wife, Riley Kellogg, watched in horror last Sunday as the flames in nearby trees inched closer and closer to their home of nearly five years. Suddenly, they realized they had no choice but to evacuate. “We didn’t know if we were coming back to the home or not,” Towsen told CNN three days later, as he stood in front of his home in Greenwood Lake, about 35 miles northwest of New York City. Behind him, firefighters were still dousing the flames that had threatened the neighborhood, leaving behind rows of burnt trees. “It’s kind of miraculous that we do still have a home and we’re very thankful for that,” Kellogg added. Across the street, she pointed to a home she says was destroyed by a microburst – a punch of sinking air in a severe thunderstorm that could cause damage similar to a tornado – during a severe thunderstorm in May, just one month after a 4.8 magnitude earthquake shook their community. “The disasters that we’ve been experiencing, I hope that they really bring home to people what’s going on, on a global scale,” Kellogg said. “And how, when we see the effects of it on our own lives here, that we really can connect them to what’s happening all over the world and how our actions and our connections and what we do in our governments, how all of this has an effect on our lives directly.” It’s been a year of unusual extremes for New Yorkers. In April, a 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattled buildings across parts of the Northeast. Throughout the summer, multiple towns experienced tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. In July, an EF2 tornado passed through Rome during a severe storm that killed one person and caused widespread damage. An EF1 tornado in Buffalo also damaged buildings and trees and overturned cars in August. There are currently 13 wildfires across the state encompassing more than 5,000 acres, according to Governor Kathy Hochul’s office. Among the fires is the Jennings Creek/Sterling State Park fire, which tore through areas along the New Jersey-New York border. An 18-year-old New York State Forest Ranger volunteer and state employee died on November 9 when a tree fell while he was responding to the wildfire in Greenwood Lake. Human-induced climate change fuels more extreme wildfire conditions globally and in the US, providing a stark reminder of how the climate crisis is upending lives and inflicting billions of dollars a year in damage. It will only get worse, according to fire experts. New York City alone has experienced over 230 brush fires since October 29, according to the New York City Fire Department. A brush fire in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park burned two acres of dry vegetation, spurring firefighters to battle the blaze for more than three hours, the fire department said. Only 0.01 inch of precipitation was recorded in October in New York City, making it the driest month in the city since record keeping began in 1869, a spokesperson for the New York City Emergency Management Department told CNN. “Central Park normally sees over 8.5 inches of rain in September and October but has only seen about 1.5 inches since the beginning of September,” the spokesperson said. “That’s a huge difference.” With this lack of rainfall, drought numbers have been increasing substantially across the Northeast. As of November 5, about 55% of the region was under some sort of drought, providing plenty of fuel for wildfires. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for over 50 million people over the past week, including Washington DC, Philadelphia, New York and Boston. Record-breaking heat waves, severe floods and wildfires, exacerbated by rapid climate change, are the new normal –- and people should start getting used to unusual and extreme weather, according to climate scientists and experts. “Everything’s just getting a little wackier. There’s a scientist who called it Global Weirding. Everything’s getting weird,” Stephanie Spera, an assistant professor of geography, environment and sustainability at the University of Richmond, told CNN “Almost every single person can say they have experienced an extreme weather event, whether it be hurricane or tornado or wildfire or blizzard. It’s getting harder and harder.” Earthquakes, most of which are the result of a slippage of geologic plates sliding past each other, are not correlated to climate change, says Brenda Ekwurzel, the director of scientific excellence at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Recently, scientists have also noticed an increase in tornado reports happening in the Northeast. A record 32 tornadoes in New York have been reported to date in 2024 – compared to 10 in 2023 and 7 in 2022, according to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Scientists are still investigating how the climate crisis may intensify tornado activity. Nonetheless, as climate change has created a warmer, more humid and unstable world, the conditions that produce strong thunderstorms that can form tornadoes are more likely, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. “Without hesitancy, I can say warmer climates create more favorable environments for storms, create more energy for storms, and stronger storms can lead to higher incidence of tornadoes,” Spera said. While scientists are less confident about climate change’s general effect on severe thunderstorms, they’re more confident it’s driving the unusually warm temperatures that are behind droughts across New York and other parts of the country. Wildfires are fueled by a knot of factors, both natural and human-caused, but scientists say global warming is fueling more frequent, more intense and severe blazes. Hotter temperatures are the clearest climate change-fueled contributor to wildfires. In part, that’s because heat sucks the moisture from vegetation, making it much more combustible. Down the road from Towsen and Kellogg, Esler and Maureen VanHouten also watched the fire inch closer to their home. Despite their fear, however, they didn’t leave their community. “Why would you stay? There’s earthquakes and tornadoes, but it’s your home,” Maureen said. “Something just keeps you here.” The couple kept looking over their shoulders at the trucks of first responders racing up and down their road. Since the fire ignited last week, they haven’t been able to sleep through the night. “It’s your home and you’re just so, so scared of what’s going to happen, there’s so much sentimental value,” Maureen said. “Our kids grew up here. I know people say, ‘Oh, it’s just a building,’ but there’s so many memories.” Tom Howley, the mayor of the Greenwood Lake, said their community is not used to contending with fires of this magnitude. “We get snow, we get rain, we get fires, but we don’t really get extremes. This is the most extreme I’ve seen,” Howley said. Now that the region is experiencing an increase in wildfires, people should always monitor warnings for their region, says Ekwurzel, of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “These particular wildfires are often triggered by human causes, just carelessness or something sparking something,” she said. “I’ve been getting red flag warnings on my weather app, so I know I’m not supposed to burn a fire, but if people aren’t getting that information, they may be inadvertently starting a little fire and not realizing just how dry the conditions are.” As humans continue to heat up the world with fossil fuel pollution, scientists warn these kinds of fires will only become more common. “I have two young kids and I am terrified for what this means for the future with the new administration, rolling back really progressive policies,” Spera said. “I wish people would care and get involved in community organizations at this point, because I don’t know what else is left. Think about these places that you love and want to keep them around for your grandkids.”"

As President-elect Donald Trump is likely to roll back on the US’ role as a global climate leader, experts say China will have to lead the charge.                                             ","Ella Nilsen and Hien An Ngo, CNN","High above the sand dunes of China’s Kubuqi desert, nearly 200,000 solar panels have been carefully placed in rows to create the outline of a galloping steed. The giant horse is a cultural symbol for Inner Mongolia, the northern Chinese region where the massive Junma solar farm is located — but it also signifies the speed at which China is racing toward a clean energy future. China is installing wind and solar power projects faster than any other country on the planet. As President-elect Donald Trump is likely to roll back on the US’ role as a global climate leader, experts say China will have to lead the charge. And as the world’s biggest polluter of planet-heating carbon, China has more power than any other nation to put a dent in global emissions. The country accounted for a tiny fraction of the world’s carbon pollution at the turn of the 20th century, but its emissions surged as it rapidly transformed into the world’s factory and, more recently, a powerful tech innovator. It’s now the world’s biggest carbon polluter by far, accounting for nearly a third of global planet-heating emissions. Carbon pollution is worryingly at an all-time high, but there’s a glimmer of hope: emissions growth in China is slowing. Some climate experts and senior US officials think China’s emissions will soon peak and fall. A downturn couldn’t come any sooner. The year 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record, and scientists say humanity is fast running out of time to stop burning fossil fuels and avoid the most catastrophic outcomes of climate change. It’s not that China is using less energy — it’s using more than ever — but it’s just adding wind and solar power to its grid at an astonishing pace. “It’s extraordinary,” said Jonathan Pershing, a former State Department climate diplomat who now directs the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation’s environment program. “I look at it and say, this is kind of what we want the world to do.” China, for all its world-heating pollution, is a global renewables powerhouse. The country is constructing two-thirds — nearly 339 gigawatts — of the world’s utility-scale solar and wind projects. That would be enough to power more than 250 million homes, nearly double the number of homes that exist in the US. That is in addition to the 758 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity it has already built, according to the Global Energy Monitor. Chinese solar is now expanding so fast that by the early 2030s, the country will generate more power from the sun than the amount of electricity the US will consume altogether, according to the International Energy Agency. China is also leading the world in exporting solar panels around the globe — with the majority going to Europe and noticeable growth in Africa. The US, meanwhile, has put restrictions on Chinese solar imports due to forced labor concerns, and is focusing on building out its own domestic supply chain for solar. While many Western nations make ambitious climate reduction targets only to miss them, China has a tendency to under-promise and over-perform, said John Podesta, White House senior advisor for international climate policy. “In some of their planning scenarios, they’re planning for 100 gigawatts a year, but they’re building at close to 300 gigawatts a year,” Podesta told CNN. Chinese President Xi Jinping previously committed to constructing 1,200 gigawatts of renewable generation by 2030 – a target the nation has hit six years ahead of schedule. The bigger question now is whether this clean energy will also lead to coal plant retirements. Wind and solar are now capable of generating 37% of the country’s power, according to Global Energy Monitor, already displacing coal’s dominance. China is retiring its oldest coal plants and operating others less, but it hasn’t stopped building new plants. “I think they probably need to go further in the next decade to begin to retire that coal-fired power,” Podesta said. “They have the capacity to do that.” Podesta told CNN the US believes China is in the “throes” of peaking. How fast and far they now cut those emissions has enormous implications for the planet. China’s current climate commitment is to peak its planet-warming pollution sometime before 2030. For the next round of climate commitments, due in February, Podesta and US officials are urging China to cut their emissions 30% by 2035 – a steep drop. “The world is looking for a significant commitment to reduce emissions by the world’s largest emitter. They’d do well to come forward with a significant cut.” The amount of global warming that could be avoided by such a cut is huge. If China cuts its climate pollution by the 30% US officials suggest, it would save 4.7 gigatons from entering the atmosphere. That’s the same amount the US is projected to pollute this year, according to State Department officials. CNN has reached out to China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment. In a recent press briefing, Department of Climate Change director Xia Yingxian said China was actively considering its 2035 target for cutting emissions, which all countries party to the Paris Agreement are obliged to announce next year. It’s tough to forecast exactly when China’s emissions will peak, or if they already have. Recent independent analysis by UK-based climate website Carbon Brief found China’s emissions fell by 1% earlier this year, the first time the country registered an emissions decline since Covid-19 shuttered its economy. Experts also say it’s too soon to say whether this drop is evidence of a sustained trend. And a 1% drop is not nearly enough to hit the Chinese government’s own climate targets for next year. But what’s clear is a fundamental shift is underway in China’s economy. As China’s post-Covid infrastructure boom has slowed, so too has demand for heavy industry materials like cement and steel. Manufacturing of solar panels and electric vehicles, meanwhile, is ramping up. “I want to be cautious here, but we are seeing a U-turn in the last few months,” Li Shuo, director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told CNN. Since 2015, China has been responsible for 90% of global emissions growth, Shuo said, so its emissions plateauing “would definitely mean that global emissions will peak and plateau.” “This will mark a very significant turning point in the global effort to combat climate change,” Shuo said. “This will still be an insufficient first step. But I think nevertheless, it is important milestone.”"

Over 2 million people are under this tornado watch, including residents of Oklahoma City. There have been well over 1,700 tornado reports this year, far above the year-to-date average of 1,274. The National Weather Service has also issued flood watches across parts of Texas and Oklahoma through the day on Monday and into Louisiana beginning Monday evening. Rainfall of 1 to 4 inches is expected across the Plains, while the New Orleans area could see 3 to 5 inches with isolated chances of totals exceeding 5 inches. Cities including Oklahoma City experienced one of their driest Octobers on record. However, in a climate with more extreme weather events, November has become one of the wettest on record for the city. Almost 7 inches of rainfall has been recorded in Oklahoma City this month, making it the fourth wettest November on record with 12 more days left until December. While cities including Atlanta and Memphis could see rainfall by midweek, cities across the Northeast, including New York, Washington, Philadelphia and Boston, will have to wait until the end of the week for their chance of precipitation. Many of these cities are coming off some of their driest Octobers and are in desperate need of rain. A separate series of storms is also set to affect the West, bringing rounds of valley rainfall and heavy mountain snowfall. Winter weather alerts are in place for seven Western states – Washington, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico – while up to a foot of snow is expected across the Cascades and the northern Rockies. The strongest storm across the West is set to begin Tuesday, where heavy rainfall and mountain snowfall are expected. Snowfall could reach 2 to 3 feet in parts of the Cascades between Tuesday and Wednesday. Parts of Oregon, Washington and northern California will also experience heavy lower-elevation rainfall. From Tuesday night through Saturday, these states could see 6 to 14 inches of rain, with isolated totals around the King Range potentially reaching 21 inches. These rains could cause rivers to rapidly rise and could also cause flash flooding and mudslides."

This fall is on pace to be one of, if not the warmest on record across the Lower 48, a CNN analysis of preliminary data from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information shows. The average temperature across the Lower 48 this fall is more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit above normal as of November 15. The warmest fall on record in 2016 was 4.04 degrees warmer than average. This fall will likely finish cooler than 7 degrees above normal with storms on the way this week, but it has still been the warmest start to fall on record. It’s been warm even when looking at specific cities and not the country as a whole. Hundreds of locales spanning every region of the continental US are experiencing one of the warmest falls to date, data from the Southeast Regional Climate Center shows. “It’s not the fall weather of past generations,” said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist with the non-profit research group Climate Central. “Fall is not gone completely, but I think that this fall especially shows us that it is a shrinking season.” Fall has warmed by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit on average since 1970 in the Lower 48, according to data from Climate Central. It’s happening faster in the Southwest and the Rockies, but every region of the country has warmed because of climate change. Summer warmth is starting earlier during spring months and lasting later into the start of fall — eating away at both seasons, according to Winkley. That’s exactly what happened this year. Summerlike heat dominated the first two months of the season in September and October, fueling the record pace. Halloween is typically brisk for much of the Lower 48, but the holiday was unrecognizable for millions this year. Trick-or-treaters in much of the East, South and parts of the Midwest  perspired in their costumes after high temperatures reached 80s during the day. Prolonged heat and extremely dry weather have also been stuck in a loop where each factor continuously makes the other worse this season. The combination has resulted not just in record breaking temperatures, but also some of the worst drought conditions in two decades and destructive wildfires. Without adequate rain and with persistent heat baking the ground, drought is impacting every Lower 48 state, according to the latest data from the US Drought Monitor. Some states have experienced a flash drought, or when drought conditions become quite severe in a short timeframe. New Jersey is a prime example: The state had zero drought at the start of fall and now the entire state in at least moderate drought. Whether this fall ends up as the warmest or one of the warmest depends on how the last two weeks of the season unfold — and at least a temporary pattern change is underway. A series of storms will track across the Lower 48 this week and bring torrential rain to parts of the West, some wet weather to parched areas farther east and help make the weather finally feel like fall. But it could be too little, too late. Some brief bouts of fall chill have managed to break through the unseasonable warmth, but it hasn’t been enough to change the season’s warm trajectory — a trend that seems like it will continue. Forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center say above average warmth will linger for millions in the US through at least the end of November."

","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Record-breaking ocean temperatures, fueled by planet-warming pollution, have turbocharged dozens of Atlantic hurricanes over the last few years, making them more potent and dangerous by increasing their wind speeds. Every hurricane in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was made stronger than it otherwise would have been without human-caused climate change, according to analysis from nonprofit climate research group Climate Central. Wind speeds of the 11 hurricanes were increased by 9 to 28 mph by water that was up to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer because of climate change. “Every hurricane in 2024 was stronger than it would have been 100 years ago,” said Daniel Gilford, climate scientist at Climate Central and lead author of the report. “Through record-breaking ocean warming, human carbon pollution is worsening hurricane catastrophes in our communities.” The analysis built off the scientific framework of a separate analysis from the group released Wednesday and found 84% of hurricanes between 2019 and 2023 were more intense than they would have been without climate change. The wind speeds of the hurricanes were cranked up by an average of 18 mph, which caused 30 of them to go up at least one category higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. The studies’ authors say the new analyses prove how much “human beings have influenced storm intensities.” At least 90% of warming over the past several decades has taken place in oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Water in the Atlantic where hurricanes roam was at or near-record-breaking levels throughout hurricane season. Hurricanes are feeding off this extra energy, causing them to strengthen and even rapidly intensify more frequently — or have an increase in wind speeds of at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less. Nine of this season’s 11 hurricanes rapidly intensified and climbed up the hurricane category scale due to climate change-driven ocean heat. Category 5 Hurricane Milton rapidly intensified by 95 mph in just 24 hours, faster than any other storm in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the National Hurricane Center. Climate Central researchers also found that human-caused climate change made exceptionally warm ocean temperatures that fueled Milton’s explosion 400 to 800 times more likely. They also found that Milton wouldn’t have reached Category 5. The researchers found hurricanes Debby and Oscar also would have remained tropical storms instead of turning into hurricanes in a world without planet-warming pollution. Other scientists not involved in the study agreed with the researchers’ overall finding that that human-caused global warming was intensifying storms, but urged caution around the specific increase in wind speeds, particularly with projecting the influence of global warming on future storms. “I see this paper as a good way to estimate how multiple anthropogenic factors have increased hurricane intensities in the Atlantic, but I do not think that these estimates can be projected into the future,” said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and retired NOAA climate scientist. Kossin said he’s not confident that future increases in climate change-fueled ocean warming will directly lead to hurricanes becoming stronger at the same rate as they have in the past. This is because ocean temperatures are influenced by various factors other than carbon pollution, and the impact of temperature changes on hurricanes could differ in the future. Still, climate experts say one thing is certain: as global temperatures continue to rise, the potential for more powerful and destructive hurricanes like the ones that formed in the Atlantic this year becomes increasingly likely."

But at 2:40 a.m. local time Sunday, more than 30 hours after deadline, the gavel finally went down on the agreement between nearly 200 countries. “People doubted that Azerbaijan could deliver. They doubted that everyone could agree. They were wrong on both,” said Mukhtar Babayev, the Azerbaijani state-oil company veteran and president of COP29. The $300 billion will go to vulnerable, poorer nations to help them cope with increasingly devastating extreme weather and to transition their economies toward clean energy. “It has been a difficult journey, but we’ve delivered a deal,” said Simon Stiell, head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. “This new finance goal is an insurance policy for humanity, amid worsening climate impacts hitting every country.” The amount pledged, however, falls far short of the $1.3 trillion economists say is needed to help developing countries cope with a climate crisis they have done least to cause — and there has been a furious reaction from many developing countries. In a fiery speech immediately after the gavel went down, India’s representative Chandni Raina slammed the $300 billion as “abysmally poor” and a “paltry sum,” calling the agreement “nothing more than an optical illusion” and unable to “address the enormity of the challenge we all face.” Others were equally damning in their criticism. “We are leaving with a small portion of the funding climate-vulnerable countries urgently need,” said Tina Stege, Marshall Islands climate envoy. Stege heavily criticized the talks as showing the “very worst of political opportunism.” Fossil fuel interests “have been determined to block progress and undermine the multilateral goals we’ve worked to build,” she said in a statement. COP29 focused heavily on finance, a vital climate issue but one of the thorniest politically. Rich countries, which are overwhelmingly responsible for historical climate change, agreed in 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 to developing countries. That pledge, already viewed as woefully insufficient, was only met in 2022, two years past the deadline. The task at Baku was to come up with a new number. The new deal agreed to on Saturday requires wealthy countries, including the US and European nations, to provide $300 billion every year by 2035, made up of public and private finance. While the agreement also refers to a wider ambition to scale up to $1.3 trillion, developing nations wanted rich countries to commit to taking on a much larger share of this, and for the money to come predominantly in the form of grants rather than loans, which they fear will trap them further in debt. The G77 group of developing countries had called for a sum of $500 billion. But richer nations rejected higher figures as unrealistic given current economic circumstances. “We have arrived at the boundary between what is politically achievable today in developed countries and what would make a difference in developing countries,” said Avinash Persaud, special advisor on climate change to the President of the Inter-American Development Bank. There was also a push for richer emerging economies such as China and Saudi Arabia to contribute to the climate funding package, but the agreement only “encourages” developing countries to make voluntary contributions, and places no obligations on them. Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute called the deal “a flawed compromise” that reflects the “harder geopolitical terrain the world finds itself in.” The summit took place at the end of a year “virtually certain” to be the hottest on record and one in which the world has been hammered by deadly extreme weather, including back-to-back hurricanes, catastrophic flooding, devastating typhoons and severe drought in southern Africa. The urgency of dealing with climate change has never been clearer. But this was always going to be a tricky COP. It took place in Azerbaijan, a petrostate, and was awash in fossil fuel interests. More than 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists or industry players registered to attend the talks, outnumbering almost all country delegations, according to an analysis by a coalition of groups called Kick Big Polluters Out. The shadow of Donald Trump’s election in the US also loomed over proceedings. Trump has called the climate crisis a hoax, pledged to “drill, baby, drill,” and vowed to pull the US out of the landmark Paris climate agreement, stoking concerns about the future of multinational climate action. Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, which has pushed against ambitious action at past climate summits, seemed even more emboldened in Baku, publicly and explicitly rejecting any reference to oil, coal and gas in the deal. “It’s been another shady, oil-stained COP,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. “Public interest in this COP has been low and cynicism feels like it has reached an all time high,” she said. Many climate groups have heavily criticized the summit and its outcome. “This has been the most horrendous climate negotiations in years due to the bad faith of developed countries,” said Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network. “This was meant to be the finance COP, but the Global North turned up with a plan to betray the Global South.” The outcome “offers false hope to those already bearing the brunt of climate disasters,” said Harjeet Singh of the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative. “We must persist in our fight, demanding a significant increase in financing and holding developed countries to account,” he added. This story has been updated.

The answer: $300 billion a year by 2035. Rich countries said it was the best they could do. Poorer countries called it “abysmal,” falling far below the $1.3 trillion economists say they need to cope with a crisis they have not caused. In the wake of a chaotic, bitter summit and heavily criticized final deal, some experts are asking whether the whole COP process is now so lacking in ambition as to be almost worthless. Amid geopolitical upheaval, including the election of a climate denier in the US, Baku might be remembered as the beginning of the end of multilateral climate action. “The dismal outcomes of COP29 … have raised serious concerns about the integrity of the global climate negotiation process,” said Harjeet Singh, of the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative. COP climate summits are always painstaking and fraught. But they have had major successes, most notably the 2015 Paris climate agreement, under which countries committed to keeping global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5. And yet, nearly a decade later, the world is on track for the hottest year on record and levels of planet-heating pollution are projected to reach an all-time high. “We are sleepwalking into a dystopian future,” said Payam Akhavan, an attorney for the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law. “The COP process has thus far failed, because it depends on the good faith of the major polluters, and instead of doing what is necessary for our common survival, they are literally adding fuel to the flames,” he told CNN. In many ways, COP29 was set up to fail from the start: Russia ensured the summit was held in a fossil fuel-reliant nation by using its United Nations veto to prevent any European Union country from hosting. So it fell to Azerbaijan, a petrostate with little experience leading high level climate talks, to wrangle negotiations on money, the thorniest of climate issues. It was a conference of chaos. Many wealthy country leaders failed to show up, Argentina pulled out its negotiators, and some developing country groups grew so frustrated in the final throes of talks, they walked out. COPs have been held in petrostates before. But fossil fuel interests appeared truly unleashed in Baku — potentially emboldened by the imminent arrival of Donald Trump in the White House, a man who has vowed to “drill, baby, drill” and pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. More than 1,700 fossil fuel industry players and lobbyists registered to attend the summit,  heavily outnumbering most country delegations. And Saudi Arabia, a constant thorn in the side of those pushing ambitious climate action, said the quiet bit out loud at this summit, publicly and explicitly rejecting any mention of fossil fuels in the final agreement. Climate groups compared the final deal to a band-aid on a bullet wound, and developing countries reacted with fury. “This is not just a failure; it is a betrayal,” the Least Developed Countries Group on Climate Change said in a statement, adding that the “outright dismissal” of developing countries’ needs “erodes the fragile trust that underpins these negotiations and mocks the spirit of global solidarity.” For all its flaws, most climate advocates and scientists acknowledge the UN climate process remains the best mechanism the world currently has for global climate action. “It’s the only forum where nearly every country has a seat at the table,” said Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, an international lawyer representing the small island country of Vanuatu in climate litigation. “The real question,” she told CNN, “is whether the momentum can be reclaimed, and the integrity of the process restored.” Attention now turns to COP30 in Brazil next year. Billed as the most important climate summit since Paris, it’s here countries will set out their climate plans for the next 10 years. Ambition will be a uphill battle. To succeed, the whole system needs reorienting, Singh said, “to serve the interests of the most vulnerable, rather than those of fossil fuel lobbyists and polluters.” This is likely to be tough as the geopolitical terrain changes, and right-wing politicians who embrace fossil fuels and deride climate action see electoral success. There is still some hope, Akhavan said. “Even if in the short-term there might be a regression because of populists and petro-states, there is ultimately no choice but to return to a ‘bigger and better’ COP 2.0.” It’s a sentiment echoed by Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. “By lamenting on the broken process, we just add to the stalling and delay,” she told CNN. “We need to save the institutions we have. If we throw them in the gutter, Trump, Putin and Co. have won already.” CNN’s Ella Nilsen contributed to this report."

This is no longer being updated. A storm and the first punch of winterlike chill will combine to cause Thanksgiving travel headaches across the eastern half of the United States as Mother Nature serves up a smorgasbord of sloppy weather. The storm will roll through parts of the Midwest and South Wednesday night and spread across the East on Thanksgiving Day. At the same time, frigid air will surge into the US like shoppers clamoring for Black Friday deals. The storm’s exact track is still unclear and will dictate which areas receive holiday snow and which areas end up with a wet, dreary mess. But two scenarios are in play and in each there will be a disruptive storm for last second travelers. The first scenario would have a storm develop in the Plains Wednesday and strengthen as it heads east. It would become quite a potent force by Wednesday night as it spreads rain from the Midwest to the South. It would take a turn to the northeast once it reaches the Appalachian Mountains and track along their spine Thursday, tapping into some cold, Canadian air before making a beeline for the New England Coast overnight. This would deliver a round of heavy, wet snow to elevated areas of the interior Northeast Thursday while rain drenches lower elevations. Wind speeds would also increase Thursday in the East with widespread gusts up to 30 mph possible. Higher gusts are possible for areas closer to the coast, especially from the Carolinas to southern New England. Gusty winds could disrupt both air and road travel for truly last-minute travelers on Thanksgiving Day. The combination of wet weather and gusty winds could also bring down trees or power lines. The storm would reach northern Maine by Friday morning and exit the US shortly thereafter. This would make for largely dry, but still breezy weather for the East for Friday and the weekend. Another possible scenario would see the heaviest rain and risk for wet snow largely shift out of the Northeast and instead create a much wetter Thanksgiving for the mid-Atlantic. The storm would develop late Wednesday night around the Mississippi or Tennessee valleys in this scenario. It would then slowly track through the mid-Atlantic through Thursday night and reach the Atlantic Friday morning. This would bring more rain to the Southeast and mid-Atlantic Thursday while limiting chances for drenching rain and accumulating snow in the Northeast. But how close to the coast the storm lingers once it reaches the Atlantic Friday will affect post-holiday travel. A mix of rain and snow could develop in the Northeast and creep closer to the coast if the storm hugs the coast and tracks toward New England. This could make conditions a sloppy mess Friday at airports in the Boston area and for people traveling along the nearby Interstate-95 corridor. Wet weather would be minimal for these areas if the storm tracks farther away from the coast Friday. A widespread rush of cold, Canadian air is incoming for a huge part of the US, regardless of the late-week storm’s ultimate track. Chilly air will start to filter into the northern states early this week before a significant push of winterlike air becomes widespread Thursday. Chicago will struggle to reach the mid-30s on Thanksgiving Day — a temperature more appropriate for late December. Parts of North Dakota will barely reach the teens and will feel more like January. Millions from coast to coast will be frigid by Friday. High temperatures as far south as the Gulf Coast will likely be 10 or more degrees below normal and some locations might not reach the 60s. Many locales in the central and eastern US will experience their coldest conditions so far this season over the weekend. Philadelphia hasn’t recorded a high in the 30s since February but could come close both Saturday and Sunday. The same can be said of New York City. The push of frigid air later this week will also flip the switch on the Great Lakes’ lake-effect snow machine. Cold, Canadian air rushing over the record-warm lakes will set the stage for lake-effect snow that could persist into next week for some areas. Cold air will stick around for much of the East as the calendar flips to December and could last through the first week of the new month, according to forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center."

","Ella Nilsen and Laura Paddison, CNN","High above Earth, a cutting-edge satellite is zooming around the planet 15 times a day. It is hunting for leaks of methane — an invisible, super-polluting gas that is dramatically warming the planet. Its measurements are precise enough to plot heatmaps of the biggest offenders, lighting up all the places they are venting the gas into the atmosphere at a staggering rate, unbeknownst to regulators, as the planet careens toward what scientists warn could be irreversible climate change impacts. MethaneSAT’s early findings are that the oil and gas industry is belching the gas at a rate three to five times higher on average than what the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated, and way beyond the rate the industry itself agreed to in 2023. The Permian Basin, one of the most productive oil and gas basins in the world, is leaking methane to the tune of 9 to 14.5 times the limit the industry agreed to — nearly 640,000 pounds per hour. The Appalachia Basin is leaking at four times the industry-set rate. And in Utah’s Uinta Basin, the leak rate is an astonishing 45 times the industry-set limit. Although it’s leaking less overall than the Permian Basin, for example, it’s an older basin — with older, leaky equipment — that’s producing far less oil and gas. “This is just very, very revealing — for the first time, to see this kind of observation,” said Ritesh Gautam, lead senior scientist on MethaneSAT. “The images we started to see were just extraordinary in terms of the overall precision of the data.” Methane pollution has long been underestimated and not well-understood, and yet natural gas — which is up to 90% methane — is rising as the fossil fuel of choice to generate electricity. What scientists do know is that methane traps about 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide in their first 20 years in the atmosphere. “Understating real methane emission levels means underestimating their warming impact. Given the potency of methane, this is a real problem,” said Antoine Halff, co-founder and chief analyst at environmental monitoring group Kayrros. “If we don’t understand the scale of the problem, then our mitigation efforts won’t nearly be aggressive enough.” The satellite’s early reports have been staggering.  Over half a million wells that produce just 6 to 7% of US oil and gas generate roughly 50% of the industry’s methane pollution. The leaks “might be hard to individually detect, but they all add up,” Gautam said. “In aggregate, there are so many of them – thousands and thousands across these basins.” The satellite also gathered data from Turkmenistan and Venezuela, two other major oil-producing countries. The problem is particularly severe in the South Caspian Basin in Turkmenistan, one of the planet’s largest methane hot spots. This region is pumping out methane at 1.5 times the rate of the Permian Basin, according to the data — more than 970,000 pounds per hour. Scientists are confident in MethaneSAT’s readings because its data is in line with previous studies. Kayrros’s 2023 analysis of global methane pollution found Turkmenistan had the highest oil and gas methane intensity in the world, although emissions have been decreasing, said Halff. “Turkmenistan is a very large oil and gas producer with aging infrastructure, some of which dates back to the Soviet era,” he told CNN. Dilapidated equipment tends to be leakier, and in parts of the Caspian Basin, gas is often treated as a waste product and vented or flared. MethaneSAT also produced the first images of methane emissions from Venezuela, a South American petrostate with the world’s largest oil reserves. But because of Venezuela’s proximity to the tropics and frequent cloud cover, capturing its methane emissions has proved challenging. “What (it’s) left with is methane observations in between the presence of clouds … revealing for the first time these big emission hot spots in in persistently cloudy regions like Venezuela,” Gautam said. Tackling methane emissions has great potential to ease the pace of the climate crisis. Cutting methane pollution is the fastest way to curb the pace of the climate crisis, and the oil and gas industry is “the ‘low-hanging fruit’ of methane mitigation,” said Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon Project and a climate professor at Stanford University. But the climate crisis still needs an actual solution – which is to stop using fossil fuels altogether, Jackson said. Plugging up leaks is “pretending to cut emissions,” Jackson said. “Companies make cutting emissions intensity sound like a cut in actual emissions. It isn’t, of course. It’s better than nothing, but it avoids the stronger need to cut fossil fuel use.”"

Before they could make much progress, the tide washed it away. “It’s pointless!” one man shouted. “We came here because the sea was our only protection. And now the sea is attacking us,” another said. The wooden poles holding up the tents, barely anchored to the ground, shook with every gust of wind. Families shuffled around them in distress, worried they’d collapse. The head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) warned Tuesday in a post on X that as winter comes, people in Gaza “need everything, but very little comes in.” “Winter in Gaza means people will not only die because of air strikes, diseases or hunger. Winter in Gaza means more people will die shivering because of the cold, especially among the most vulnerable including older people + children,” Philippe Lazzarini said. In October, the amount of aid entering Gaza hit the lowest level since Israel’s war in the enclave started, according to data compiled by the UN. COGAT, the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into Gaza, said it was collaborating with the international community, including “facilitating the entry of winter supplies and shelter equipment, including heaters, warm clothing, tents and blankets.” But UNRWA says the aid is not enough, and said Israel had blocked almost all efforts by the United Nations to deliver aid to northern Gaza in recent weeks. The average temperature in Gaza falls to between 10°C and 20°C (50F to 68F) in December, dipping a couple of degrees lower on average in January. The rainy season typically lasts from November to February, with January the wettest month. The water that flooded into some tents in Deir al-Balah soaked everything inside, leaving blankets and carpets a tangled, dusty mess. Large plastic sheets which served as the floor sunk into the wet sand, leaving nothing between those sheltering inside and the bare ground. “What will keep us warm tonight?” Mohammad Younis asked, as he picked up his wet clothes. “We’re like beggars in front of the world, and nobody cares about us. I don’t know where I’ll sleep. I’ll end up sleeping in the sea,” he cried. The tarpaulin serving as a roof on Younis’ tent is now torn, allowing water in. In another makeshift tent flooded by the raging sea, a displaced family of 10 sat shivering while the mother, Um Fadi, cooked over a fire. When they were displaced from Rafah months ago, she said, they were forced to shelter on the beach because there was nowhere else to go. “We’re trapped from all directions. From the sea, from the Israelis, from not having a home, from hunger,” she said. After a year of war following Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel, at least 1.9 million people – or about 90% of the population across the Gaza Strip – are internally displaced, according to the UN. Many have been displaced repeatedly, some 10 times or more, it added. The Norwegian Refugee Council said in a recent report that Israel’s continued offensive has given Palestinians fewer options for shelter this year compared to last. “This winter, as fewer buildings remain standing, many Palestinians are forced to live in tents and makeshift shelters that provide considerably less protection against cold wind and rain,” the report said. As of September 2024, more than 200,000 housing units in Gaza had been destroyed and severely damaged, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which added that nearly 1 million people are in need of “winterization support.” Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought shelter in Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, designated a “humanitarian zone” by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Many are living in tents in an area with limited infrastructure or access to humanitarian aid. In recent months, the coastal camp has been hit repeatedly by Israeli strikes, attacks the IDF says are targeting Hamas. The tents are dilapidated after heavy rain and brutal winds. As Sunday’s storm whipped through, people’s belongings were strewn along the beach, some having been swallowed up by the sea. Mohammed Alkhatib, deputy director of programs for Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) in Gaza said the suffering of displaced Palestinians in Gaza had “many faces” in a statement shared with CNN by MAP. Most of the tents and makeshift shelters they rely on have been used for months and need replacement to withstand harsh winter conditions, he said. “It is beyond imagination, knowing that they can barely survive regular weather with whatever they have… A lack of proper clothing, blankets and safe heating methods mean families will remain cold and at risk for many months,” he added. It’s a fear that haunts Um Fadi in Deir al-Balah every day. “Tonight, we’re threatened by great danger. At any moment, the sea might engulf us. We don’t know what we will do,” she said. In northern Gaza, the Israeli military is carrying out a widespread operation that has entered its second month. The bombardment has displaced up to 130,000 Palestinians since October 6, according to the United Nations Population Fund, and the need for aid is acute. Many have sought shelter in Yarmouk sports stadium in Gaza City, where decrepit tents made of white cloth turned brown on Sunday following an evening of heavy rain. As in the seafront shelter, young children stood barefoot on the wet asphalt or waded through puddles, wearing barely enough to keep them warm, while their parents tried to repair the damaged tents. Weather is posing one of the biggest risks for Palestinians in Gaza now and is “another component to kill people,” Louise Wateridge, a senior emergency officer with UNRWA, told CNN on Friday from Gaza City. “The wind and the rain is picking up and people are living in these very, very dangerous structures… this bad weather could bring these buildings down on top of people.” Sami Salehi said he had fled “suffering, airstrikes, attacks and death” in the north, seeking shelter in Gaza City. But water had engulfed his tent and he told CNN he had no fuel or wood to start a fire. Picking up his wet blanket and soaked mattress, he asked how he and his 14 children would sleep that night. “This tent is made of cloth, so when water comes in, it goes everywhere. And we’re in a low-lying area, so even if the roof protects us, water will come from below,” he said. After suffering an injury in an Israeli airstrike, Salehi said he thought he’d die, but was surprised to see that God had saved his life. “I wish I died instead. Death is more honorable than this life.” This story has been updated to reflect a statement from COGAT. Mohammad Al-Sawalhi and Tareq ElHelou reported from Gaza.

","Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","A quick-hitting but potent winter storm is delivering intense bursts of snow and strong winds from the Midwest to the Northeast, knocking out power and creating dangerous travel conditions for commuters. The storm slid east and expanded its wintry conditions over more of the Great Lakes, Midwest and parts of the interior Northeast Wednesday afternoon. Snow squalls slammed parts of northern Ohio and an area south of Chicago Wednesday night into early Thursday, with the threat of more snow squalls spreading to the interior Northeast beginning Thursday morning. Snow squalls are intense but brief bursts of heavy snow and strong winds that can create blinding, whiteout conditions seemingly out of nowhere, and are incredibly dangerous for drivers. “There is no safe place on a highway during a snow squall,” the Weather Prediction Center warned. “Dangerous travel conditions are likely, including whiteout visibility and rapidly worsening road conditions.” A snow squall was responsible for a massive pileup in Pennsylvania in 2022 that involved 80 vehicles and killed six people. A few snow squalls also blew across parts of North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin Wednesday morning and early afternoon. And as the next round of snowfall is ongoing across the Great Lakes and interior Northeast, a reinforcing shot of cold air is spreading across the East, bringing drastic temperature drops ranging from 10-25 degrees below average. As the cold air continues to spread into the East, high temperatures largely in the 40s and 50s on Wednesday will plunge to the 20s and 30s for Thursday. Another hallmark from this storm will be strong winds capable of knocking out power and damaging trees, particularly from the Appalachians and mid-Atlantic to the New England coast. Wind gusts of 30 to 50 mph will roar over the Northeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic Thursday including in Washington, DC, Philadelphia and New York City. Snow from this storm will impact a much larger area than the storms of the past few weeks, but should still dodge the cities along the Northeast’s I-95 corridor. The most snow will once again pile up in elevated areas and downwind of the Great Lakes, where 5 feet of snow fell over the holiday weekend. Snow and lake-effect from the storm could dump another 1 to 2 feet on areas that are still digging out. Lighter snow up to an inch or two is possible in some of the Northeast’s lower elevations. A few snowflakes could mix with rain at times along the Interstate-95 corridor. Any accumulating snow is unlikely close to the coast but wet roads and chilly air could lead to slick spots and tricky travel. CNN’s Robert Shackelford contributed to this report."
https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/climate/global-warming-clouds/index.html,The world has been warming faster than expected.

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Last year was the hottest on record, oceans boiled, glaciers melted at alarming rates, and it left scientists scrambling to understand exactly why. They know the extraordinary heat was fueled by a number of factors, predominantly planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels and the natural climate pattern El Niño. B﻿ut those alone did not explain the unusually rapid temperature rise. Now a new study ﻿published Thursday in the journal Science says it has identified the missing part of the puzzle: clouds. To be more specific, the rapid surge in warming was supercharged by a dearth of low-lying clouds over the oceans, according to the research — findings which may have alarming implications for future warming. In simple terms, fewer bright, low clouds mean the planet “has darkened,” allowing it to absorb more sunlight, said Helge Goessling, a report author and climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany. This phenomenon is called “albedo” and refers to the ability of surfaces to reflect the sun’s energy back into space. The Earth’s albedo has been declining since the 1970s, according to the report, due in part to the melting of light-colored snow and sea ice, exposing darker land and water which absorb more of the sun’s energy, heating up the planet. Low clouds also feed into this effect as they reflect away sunlight. The scientists scoured NASA satellite data, weather data and climate models and found the decline in low clouds reduced the planet’s albedo to record lows last year. Areas including parts of the North Atlantic Ocean experienced a particularly significant fall, the study found. Last year fits into a decade-long decline of low cloud cover, Goessling told CNN. What the study can’t yet explain for certain is why this is happening. “This is such a complex beast and so hard to disentangle,” Goessling said. He believes it is likely the result of a combination of factors. The first is a reduction in shipping pollution due to regulations aimed at reducing the industry’s harmful sulfur emissions. While this has been a win for human health, this type of pollution was also helping cool the planet by brightening clouds. Natural climate variabilities, including changing ocean patterns, may also have contributed. But Goessling points to a third, more alarming factor: global warming itself. Low-level clouds tend to thrive in a cool and moist lower atmosphere. As the planet’s surface heats up, this can cause them to thin or dissipate entirely, setting up a complicated feedback loop where low clouds are disappearing because of global warming, and their disappearance then drives further warming. If this is happening, future warming projections may be underestimated and “we should expect rather intense warming in the future,” Goessling said. Mark Zalinka, an atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who was not involved in the study, said “the fact that clouds play a key role in the story makes sense, as they essentially act as Earth’s sunscreen.” Small changes in cloud cover can “drastically change Earth’s albedo,” he told CNN. Tapio Schneider, a climate scientist at the California Institute of Technology, said the worrying implication of the research is if global warming is responsible for a substantial amount of cloud cover change, “we may see stronger global warming than previously predicted.” Clouds may seem simple, even mundane, but they are endlessly complex and scientists remain far from unraveling how they behave. They are “one of the biggest headaches” in climate science, Goessling said. But figuring out how clouds will respond to global warming is key, Zalkina said. “It literally determines how much future warming is in store.”"

","Deidre McPhillips, CNN","The United States is expected to make only minor gains in life expectancy over the next few decades, and this minimal improvement highlights an “alarming trajectory of health challenges” facing the country, researchers say. Life expectancy in the US is expected to increase from 78.3 years in 2022 to 80.4 years in 2050, according to forecasting models from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. For the analysis, published Thursday in The Lancet, researchers assessed the impacts of hundreds of diseases and other health risks on the US and individual states and compared them to a set of more than 200 other countries. They found that the US would lag in life expectancy gains, putting the country behind most other high-income nations and some middle-income nations; In terms of overall life expectancy, the US is expected to fall to 66 out of 204 countries assessed in 2050, down from 49th in 2022. Life expectancy among women in the US is predicted to improve less than men’s, shrinking the gap in life expectancy by gender. The US would drop from 51st to 74th in life expectancy for women in 2050 and from 51st to 65th for males, according to the IHME forecasts. The slight increase in US life expectancy that’s forecasted for 2050 is driven by a predicted decline in mortality due to a few leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke and diabetes, according to IHME. But addressing a few key risk factors could make even more significant improvements to US life expectancy, the forecasting models suggest. Lower rates of obesity, smoking and drug use disorders could each lead to about a half a year increase in life expectancy by 2050, for example. “In spite of modest increases in life expectancy overall, our models forecast health improvements slowing down due to rising rates of obesity, which is a serious risk factor to many chronic diseases and forecasted to leap to levels never before seen,” Christopher Murray, director of IHME and co-senior author of the new research, said in a news release. “The rise in obesity and overweight rates in the U.S., with IHME forecasting over 260 million people affected by 2050, signals a public health crisis of unimaginable scale.” GLP-1 medications are booming in popularity in the US with promising outcomes, but the future of uptake remains uncertain and IHME did not include a scenario that included these treatments as a factor. Recent data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also suggest that drug overdose deaths have started to decline after reaching record levels, but IHME notes that the levels of drug overdose remain high and will likely increase over the next few decades. IHME estimates that the rate of age-standardized mortality due to drug use disorders in the US will be the highest in the world, and more than twice as high as in Canada at second highest. “The stark contrast that’s forecasted in the next 30 years comes after a concerted effort by federal, state, and local government agencies and health systems launched after the opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency in 2017. The opioid epidemic is far from over, and greater effectiveness and continued expansion of programs to prevent and treat drug use are still needed,” Ali Mokdad, IHME professor and lead author of the report, said in the news release. Overall, if the US eliminated risk in three key areas – environment, behavioral and metabolic risks, and childhood nutrition and vaccination – there would be about 550,000 fewer deaths in 2050 alone – bringing life expectancy up by nearly four years, in line with current projections for Canada, according to the IHME forecasts. “The rapid decline of the U.S. in global rankings from 2022 to 2050 rings the alarm for immediate action. The U.S. must change course and find new and better health strategies and policies that slow down the decline in future health outcomes,” Dr. Stein Emil Vollset, co-senior author and affiliate professor with IHME, said in the news release."

Winds gusting 50 to 60 mph in the afternoon and evening threatened to knock out power across the region, including in New York City and Boston. “Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines. Widespread power outages are possible. Travel could be difficult, especially for high profile vehicles,” such as buses and trucks the National Weather Service office in Boston warned. More than 80,000 homes and businesses on the East Coast have lost power as of Wednesday night – including about 44,000 in Maine and 13,000 in Massachusetts, according to poweroutage.us. The atmospheric river feeding the system is tapping into the warm tropical ocean off the coast of the Southeast to create moisture levels rarely seen in the Northeast outside of tropical systems, allowing for faster rainfall rates and the potential for flash flooding. Experts are saying this will be the most moisture-rich system in the Northeast since last December when widespread flooding killed several people and caused significant damage to roads in Maine. This will be the first significant rain event for much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast since August, so while the atmosphere is loaded with flooding rainfall potential, the ongoing drought conditions in the region, including extreme drought conditions in New Jersey, should limit widespread flooding. “The main concerns will be urban and poor drainage flooding and ponding on roadways,” forecasters with the National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, New Jersey, said. The drought stems from a record warm and dry fall that has stretched into winter. Philadelphia hasn’t recorded more than 1 inch of rain in a day since August 6. The last time New York’s Central Park had a 2-inch soaker was August 18. Still, the storm could dump a lot of rain, and quickly. A level 2 of 4 risk for flooding rain is posted from Long Island, New York, north through Maine with more than 1.5 inches of rain expected for much of the East Coast and more isolated pockets of 2 to 4 inches possible. Rapid snow melt in areas in interior New England could add to the localized flash flooding concerns, especially near smaller creeks and low-lying areas. “The rivers across New England can thankfully take a decent surge of moisture after a very dry fall, so the prospects of significant flooding are lower than normal at this point,” adds the Weather Prediction Center. Rainfall totals may not end up quite as high for areas outside of the Northeast but parts of the mid-Atlantic could encounter a few severe thunderstorms Wednesday. A level 2 of 5 risk of severe storms is in place from eastern North Carolina north along the immediate coast to southern New England, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Damaging wind gusts are the primary threat from any thunderstorm, but a few tornadoes are also possible, particulary in eastern North Carolina. Another rush of Arctic air will arrive behind this storm, dropping temperatures back below normal. Much of the Northern Plains and Midwest will wake up to below zero wind chills by Wednesday morning. This will once again trigger the lake effect snow in the Great Lakes by the middle of the week, and 1 to 2 feet of snow is possible off lakes Erie and Ontario by the end of the week. CNN Meteorologist Mary Gilbert contributed to this report."

","Laura Paddison, CNN","Deep in the Canadian Arctic, scientists and entrepreneurs brave sub-zero temperatures, whipping winds and snowstorms to drill holes through the sea ice to pump out the seawater below and freeze it on the surface. The group from the UK start-up Real Ice is in Cambridge Bay, a tiny coastal village in Nunavut, to try to prove they can grow and restore Arctic sea ice. Their ultimate plan is to thicken ice over more than 386,000 square miles of the Arctic — an area more than twice the size of California — with the aim of slowing down or even reversing summer ice loss and, in doing so, help to tackle the human-caused climate crisis. It’s a bold plan, and one of many controversial geo-engineering proposals to save the planet’s vulnerable polar regions that range from installing a giant underwater “curtain” to protect ice sheets, to sprinkling tiny glass beads to reflect away sunlight. Some Arctic scientists and experts have criticized Real Ice’s methods as unproven at scale, ecologically risky and a distraction from tackling the root cause of climate change: fossil fuels. But the company says its project is inspired by natural processes and offers a last chance to protect a disappearing ecosystem as the world fails to act swiftly on climate change. Arctic sea ice is shrinking as humans continue to heat up the world by burning fossil fuels. Since the mid-1980s, the amount of thick, multi-year ice has shrunk by 95%. The ice that remains is young and thin. Some scientists predict the Arctic could have an ice-free summer as early as the 2030s. The loss of sea ice is a global problem. Its bright white surface reflects the sun’s energy back into space, cooling the planet. When it melts, the darker ocean exposed beneath is able to absorb more of the sun’s rays. It’s a doom loop — global warming melts the ice and melting ice supercharges global warming. Real Ice’s plan for protecting this icy ocean landscape involves inserting electric-powered, submersible pumps under sea ice to pump seawater onto the surface. The water freezes as it pools across the ice like a huge puddle, creating an extra layer of ice. The process also removes snow from the top of the ice, stripping it of an insulating layer and triggering extra growth on the underside of the sea ice, said Andrea Ceccolini, co-CEO of Real Ice. The startup has been conducting field tests in the Arctic for almost two years. The first were in Alaska last year, mostly to check that the equipment worked and could stand up to the brutal cold. The group started tests in Cambridge Bay in Canada in January this year. They covered around 44,000 square feet of ice and added an average of 20 inches of additional thickness between January and May compared to the control area, Ceccolini said. A new round of tests in Cambridge Bay began in November and they have so far covered 430,000 square feet. In the first 10 days of the trial, the ice was already 4 inches thicker in the places they were testing, said Ceccolini. They will return in the new year and again in May to measure how much ice has been created. Based on previous results, they expect between around 16 to 31 inches of ice gain, Ceccolini said. “​​It is early days,” said Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge, which has been working with Real Ice on the trials. But early results have been encouraging, he told CNN. “I am optimistic, but we need more experiments and more data.” The ultimate plan is to automate the process using underwater drones, each about 6.5 feet long and powered by green hydrogen. These will melt holes in the ice from below using heated drills. Ceccolini estimates around 500,000 drones would be used at full scale, and would be deployed carefully to avoid animal migration paths or shipping lanes, he said. If all goes to plan, he expects they can scale up within eight to 10 years. It won’t be cheap. Real Ice estimates the cost to be between $5 billion and $6 billion a year to thicken ice over 386,000 square miles, an area it believes is large enough “to be effective in slowing down and even reversing the losses of summer sea ice in the Arctic,” Ceccolini said. Real Ice is mostly self funded with some money from investors. Eventually, they see a global fund or governments stepping in to pay. They also envision selling “cooling credits,” where polluters pay toward ice refreezing in order to “offset” their own pollution. It’s a compelling vision but many scientists remain doubtful it could work at scale. The science is sound, said Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, “ice will be made measurably thicker and brighter in local areas surrounding the pumps.” But a big question, she told CNN, is whether enough sea ice can be grown over a long enough period to make any difference to the climate crisis. “I have serious doubts,” she said. The scalability of Real Ice’s solution is “extremely questionable,” said Liz Bagshaw, associate professor in polar environmental change at the University of Bristol. She also warned of potentially wide-ranging ecological impacts on a vulnerable region. “Such interventions are morally dubious at best, and at worst, ethically irresponsible,” she told CNN. Dozens of scientists expressed concerns in a recent report about polar geoengineering projects, including ice thickening. They warned of “the possibility of grave unforeseen consequences,” including the environmental impact of “an unprecedented level of human presence” in the Arctic. Ceccolnini does not deny the project could cause changes to the marine environment – for example, they are looking at algae growth that can be affected by ice thickness – but believes overall impacts will be limited. The project’s future depends on whether they can prove ice thickening is effective and that it creates no significant side effects, he said. “Everything we do has an impact,” Ceccolini said. “The problem is there is a much more dramatic impact in just letting things go on like this.”"

A five-day forecast in the early 1980s was only accurate about 65% of the time. But better weather observations, more robust computing power and innovations in the way weather around the globe is modeled by computers has improved forecasts by leaps and bounds. Today the same forecast hits the mark nine times out of 10.

Its forecasts through 15 days were significantly more accurate than one of the most well-respected traditional non-AI forecast models, according to a study published by DeepMind in the journal Nature.                        “It’s an impressive result,” said Peter Dueben, a machine learning expert and head of Earth system modeling at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, home to the model bested by GenCast. “It’s a big step.”                        GenCast isn’t ready for the public yet. It and other AI models still have a few key kinks to work out, particularly in forecasting the more frequent and severe weather of a warming world, before they change forecasting and save lives in the process.                                                                   Ad Feedback                                                 Man vs. machine                    The skill and usefulness of weather forecast models has always been closely tied to technology.                        The majority of weather forecast models used today are based on a complex series of mathematical equations that model the physics of the atmosphere and use hundreds of millions of datapoints from real-time weather observations to paint a picture of how the weather will play out a day, a week or even a season from now.                                                                                                                      Satellite imagery shows moisture moving through an upper level of the atmosphere on November 30, 2024.                 CIRA/RAMMB                                          This process of numerical weather prediction was first conceived in the early 1900s and needed to be done by hand, a method so slow that the weather had already happened long before calculations were finished.                        Early computers improved forecasting in the 1950s and 1960s, but it wasn’t until 1974 that the first model able to pull in data from around the globe and generate a rudimentary forecast became operational.                        Skip to the current day and supercomputers are performing a nearly unfathomable number of calculations daily to produce highly detailed weather forecasts many days into the future around the globe.                        But current forecast models still have limitations. The most robust ones can only be run every few hours because of how long it takes to crunch the complex calculations. They also demand a lot of computing power and energy that make them costly.                        And they have limitations when it comes to forecasting, too. The farther out in time they get from observations of the atmosphere, the more difficult it is to get a clear idea of what’s to come because the atmosphere never stops changing.                                                                                                                      Satellite imagery captures the changing weather in the Western Hemisphere on December 11, 2024.                 CIRA/RAMMB                                          Most AI weather forecasting models like Google’s GenCast take a different approach. Rather than relying on observations plugged into physics-based equations, they predict how Earth’s atmosphere might behave in the future by analyzing verified past weather data to understand how the atmosphere behaved in similar situations. This helps improve accuracy over traditional models by eliminating errors from real-time weather data.                        AI forecast models also run simulations a lot faster and use less computing power and energy than traditional models once they’re trained and ready to go. This means they can be run more frequently and model a wider range of possibilities, improving forecasts as they do.                  Google’s game changer                    AI weather modeling before Google’s GenCast has been limited to models that spit out a singular forecast without any indication of how likely it is to happen. It’s essentially a best guess that’s most useful for predicting common weather variables like temperature, precipitation and wind a handful of days in advance.                        But GenCast runs dozens of simulations simultaneously.                        “Once you have multiple possible futures it gives you a sense of both the range of what might happen and it also lets you calculate how likely some (futures) are rather than others,” according to Ilan Price, the lead author of the new study and a senior research scientist with DeepMind.                        This type of modeling approach is highly regarded because it lends more confidence to weather forecasts for around five to 15 days in the future.                        The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’s model is widely considered to be the gold standard. It was what Google wanted to beat with its first-of-its-kind AI version — and it did.                        Researchers trained GenCast on 40 years of weather data up to 2018. They then used the trained model to predict more than 1,300 combinations of conditions like temperatures, precipitation and wind speeds, in 2019’s weather.                                                                                                                      A bomb cyclone slams the US Northwest on November 19, 2024.                 CIRA/RAMMB                                          The AI model produced more accurate forecasts than the ECMWF’s traditional model for more than 97% of these variables within a 15-day timeframe, but showed particular skill within the first week of forecasts.                        It showed anywhere from a 10 to 30% accuracy improvement on forecasts in the three-to-five-day range, depending on the exact combination of variables tested, according to Price. GenCast also had more accurate forecasts than the ECMWF’s model up to 15 days in the future, the study said.                        The AI model could better capture some forms of extreme weather, including exceptionally high and low temperatures and extreme wind speeds. GenCast also needed less than 10 minutes to run on a supercomputer, compared to the hours necessary for traditional models.                        The results mark an “inflection point” in AI weather modeling technology, Price said.                        “AI-based weather forecasting is ready for prime time,” Price added. “It’s ready to start being incorporated alongside… traditional models in operation.”                        GenCast is not in operation yet, but the DeepMind team plans to take another step toward it by releasing its present-day forecasts and an archive of its past forecasts, according to Price.                  A big problem to solve                    GenCast is a critical advancement in modeling, but like any other weather forecast model, it isn’t perfect.                        AI models introduce a new potential issue since they predict the future based on what they’ve seen in past data.                        “The machine learning model… doesn’t know anything about physics,” Dueben explained.                        This can make it difficult for AI to conceive of future extremes that haven’t occurred in the recent past. Can an AI model trained on only 40 years of data accurately predict the types of extremes happening at a record pace in a changing climate, like a once-in-100 year or once-in-1,000 year torrential rainfall event?                        “It turns out that actually these models are more robust to those extreme events than you would think,” Dueben said. The ECMWF has tested AI models against real-time weather for more than a year now and has seen improvements in their overall accuracy, even with extreme events, he explained.                        But AI models can start inventing impossible-on-Earth physics the farther out in time they look, according to Dueben.                        Other prediction issues remain, particularly with one of the most destructive weather phenomena: tropical cyclones.                        Accurately predicting how strong a tropical cyclone like a hurricane or typhoon could become is an issue that plagues all models. It’s a crucial problem to solve as tropical systems get stronger and rapidly intensify more frequently in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.                        GenCast showed better skill than traditional models when predicting the tracks of tropical systems but struggled to accurately capture intensity, according to Price.                        In part, that’s because some of the recent notable record-breaking systems weren’t included in the 40 years of data GenCast was trained on, Price noted.                        It’s an issue Price is “quite confident” can be overcome in the future as the model trains on more data.

Each step forward with this nascent technology adds another tool human weather forecasters can use to craft accurate forecasts people rely on for almost every aspect of their lives.                        “You can be as skeptical as you want against machine learning forecasts in principle,” Dueben said. “These models will make a positive impact on our weather predictions; there’s no question there.”                                                                                Accurately predicting the weather is hard — really hard, but a new AI-powered forecast model just hit a milestone that has experts saying your forecast could soon get more accurate, and further out, too. It takes a Herculean effort to keep pace with weather in an atmosphere constantly in flux. The task is so difficult and complex that a reliable forecast more than a couple of days in advance was unheard of just a few decades ago. A five-day forecast in the early 1980s was only accurate about 65% of the time. But better weather observations, more robust computing power and innovations in the way weather around the globe is modeled by computers has improved forecasts by leaps and bounds. Today the same forecast hits the mark nine times out of 10. Forecasts took another step forward this month, experts said, thanks to GenCast, a new artificial intelligence forecast model by Google’s DeepMind. Its forecasts through 15 days were significantly more accurate than one of the most well-respected traditional non-AI forecast models, according to a study published by DeepMind in the journal Nature. “It’s an impressive result,” said Peter Dueben, a machine learning expert and head of Earth system modeling at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, home to the model bested by GenCast. “It’s a big step.” GenCast isn’t ready for the public yet. It and other AI models still have a few key kinks to work out, particularly in forecasting the more frequent and severe weather of a warming world, before they change forecasting and save lives in the process. The skill and usefulness of weather forecast models has always been closely tied to technology. The majority of weather forecast models used today are based on a complex series of mathematical equations that model the physics of the atmosphere and use hundreds of millions of datapoints from real-time weather observations to paint a picture of how the weather will play out a day, a week or even a season from now. This process of numerical weather prediction was first conceived in the early 1900s and needed to be done by hand, a method so slow that the weather had already happened long before calculations were finished. Early computers improved forecasting in the 1950s and 1960s, but it wasn’t until 1974 that the first model able to pull in data from around the globe and generate a rudimentary forecast became operational. Skip to the current day and supercomputers are performing a nearly unfathomable number of calculations daily to produce highly detailed weather forecasts many days into the future around the globe. But current forecast models still have limitations. The most robust ones can only be run every few hours because of how long it takes to crunch the complex calculations. They also demand a lot of computing power and energy that make them costly. And they have limitations when it comes to forecasting, too. The farther out in time they get from observations of the atmosphere, the more difficult it is to get a clear idea of what’s to come because the atmosphere never stops changing. Most AI weather forecasting models like Google’s GenCast take a different approach. Rather than relying on observations plugged into physics-based equations, they predict how Earth’s atmosphere might behave in the future by analyzing verified past weather data to understand how the atmosphere behaved in similar situations. This helps improve accuracy over traditional models by eliminating errors from real-time weather data. AI forecast models also run simulations a lot faster and use less computing power and energy than traditional models once they’re trained and ready to go. This means they can be run more frequently and model a wider range of possibilities, improving forecasts as they do. AI weather modeling before Google’s GenCast has been limited to models that spit out a singular forecast without any indication of how likely it is to happen. It’s essentially a best guess that’s most useful for predicting common weather variables like temperature, precipitation and wind a handful of days in advance. But GenCast runs dozens of simulations simultaneously. “Once you have multiple possible futures it gives you a sense of both the range of what might happen and it also lets you calculate how likely some (futures) are rather than others,” according to Ilan Price, the lead author of the new study and a senior research scientist with DeepMind. This type of modeling approach is highly regarded because it lends more confidence to weather forecasts for around five to 15 days in the future. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’s model is widely considered to be the gold standard. It was what Google wanted to beat with its first-of-its-kind AI version — and it did. Researchers trained GenCast on 40 years of weather data up to 2018. They then used the trained model to predict more than 1,300 combinations of conditions like temperatures, precipitation and wind speeds, in 2019’s weather. The AI model produce"

It’s a monumental figure, yet if industries like production, energy and transport can’t be transformed, the true cost for humanity could be much higher. Tracking developments in this transition is all part of the job for WEF President Børge Brende. CNN spoke with him last weekend at the Doha Forum, an annual gathering of high-level diplomats and policymakers in the Qatari capital, for a temperature check on the century’s biggest challenge. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: What are some of the challenges that come with transitioning to a green economy and do the benefits outweigh those challenges? Børge Brende: There is no doubt that the cost of inaction far exceeds the cost of action when it comes to climate change. So we do have to act, but there’s also a big energy transition taking place and there are several challenges at the same time. There’s energy poverty – 800 million people don’t have access to electricity – there’s energy security, and then there’s a decoupling of growth in energy and CO2 emissions. Is the Middle East headed in the right direction? What does this mean for the future? Decarbonization has started in the Middle East. Some of the biggest solar plants in the world are being installed and established here in the Middle East, and especially in the GCC countries (United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait). Renewables will play a very important role in the energy transition that we will hopefully see in the coming decade. Also the price of renewables is falling dramatically ­– solar power has fallen to one-tenth of the price in a decade, so that makes it also very competitive. Should events like this be considered an opportunity for sustainable development and economic growth? This event also focuses on the energy transition, and Qatar is a major exporter of liquid natural gas. We know that gas emits half (the carbon emissions) coal does. So in the energy transition, natural gas can also in many countries be a bridge between heavily emitting fossil fuels to a renewables-based society."

It could prove valuable as our planet bakes,11-28-2024,"                                                 In a world where the climate is increasingly hot and volatile, farmers are having trouble keeping their crops cool. A startup founded in Saudi Arabia thinks it might have a solution.                                             ","Tom Page, CNN","In a world where the climate is increasingly hot and volatile, farmers are having trouble keeping their crops cool. A startup founded in the desert of Saudi Arabia thinks it might have a solution. Its technology reduces temperatures inside greenhouses by up to 7 degrees Celsius, without losing any light, by using nanotechnology embedded within plastic polymer sheeting to cut out near infrared solar radiation. By reducing heat inside greenhouses, the company claims crops can be grown with as much as 30% less water, and less energy required in a greenhouse with mechanical cooling. Called SecondSky, it was developed by Derya Baran, an associate professor in material science and engineering at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). The prize-winning design was quickly commercialized and now boasts buyers in 15 countries, via Iyris (formerly RedSea), a company spun out of the research efforts at KAUST. Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were among the earliest countries to adopt the technology, Iyris executive chairperson John Keppler told CNN – hot, dry, resource-scarce countries looking to curb their reliance on imports for fresh produce. But since then, farmers in parts of the US, Latin America, Mexico, Europe, South Africa and Morocco have started installing SecondSky coverings. These are, said Keppler, countries that historically have benefited from a robust set of environmental attributes that are changing rapidly: “It’s not even just future-proofing, it’s current-proofing; it’s writing an insurance policy,” he said. Following the hottest summer globally on record, this year is all but certain to be the warmest in history, per Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, with many extreme heat events felt across the world – events becoming more possible due to human-induced climate change. These conditions put a massive strain on agriculture. Heat peaks can desiccate crops, killing them outright if unmitigated, or stressing crops, leaving them more vulnerable to pests and disease. Avoiding a decrease in crop yield typically requires increased energy inputs – more water, more cooling, more fertilizer – resources that may be depleted or simply unavailable. “The mission of this company is to enable sustainable agriculture, and we’re making some very important progress against a really difficult challenge,” said Keppler. “The sooner we can deliver drop-in solutions for regular-way agriculture, the better off we’re going to be.” Iyris has integrated SecondSky into flexible polyfilm, which is used for polytunnels, plastic sheets for rigid greenhouses, and netting. Polyfilm is typically replaced every three to five years, said Keppler, and can be easily swapped in. Iyris says that unlike some traditional interventions to block heat, such as applying white chalk to plastic film, its additive does not negatively impact the plastic’s lifespan. The company has partnered with plastics producers such as SABIC in Saudi Arabia, Hyma Plastic in Egypt and Armando Alvarez in Spain to manufacture and distribute coverings containing its heat-blocking additive, and it says to date 4.5 million square meters of its materials have been sold. Vincent Martin, director of the Office of Innovation at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, told CNN via email that “a number of agritech start-ups have emerged in recent years to address regional food production challenges, especially investing in protected agriculture.” These companies are “adapting to the realities of extreme heat through innovations in resilient crops, controlled environments, smart irrigation, and renewable energy. However, scaling these solutions to reach smallholder farmers and addressing cost barriers are critical for broader adaptation. “Continued investment in research, infrastructure, policies and farmer education will be key,” he added. While Iyris has its sights on the global market (it received $16 million in series A fundraising earlier this year) SecondSky is having a hand in redefining what’s possible in agriculture closer to home. In Saudi Arabia, the National Food Production Initiative, a partnership including Iyris and regenerative tourism developer Red Sea Global, created a 0.75-hectare farm on unproductive land in Bada, in the northwest of the country, a subtropical desert where summer temperatures average just below 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). The project, announced in October, is integrating multiple homegrown agritech solutions, including SecondSky, to grow crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and herbs, supplied to Red Sea Global resorts. “(We’re) proving these incredibly innovative outcomes in the harshest environment in the world,” said Keppler. The farm in Bada has prompted a local cooperative to explore replicating the model, he added. Making use of unproductive land, and preventing land from becoming unproductive, will come into increased focus as the century progresses. Desertification is a pressing issue and will be the focus of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification’s COP16 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in December, as leaders seek to curtail an accelerating problem. Worldwide, at least 100 million hectares of healthy land are lost each year, per the United Nations – the equivalent of four soccer fields of healthy land is becoming degraded every second. In Saudi Arabia, for example, where less than 1% of land is considered arable, water requirements for crop cultivation can be three times the global average, and the kingdom’s groundwater aquifers, a major source of water for agriculture, are decreasing, having been extracted at higher rates than they are being replenished. “Agritech and sustainable agricultural practices can play a crucial role in mitigating or reversing desertification,” said Martin, through things like sustainable land management, water management innovations, development of resilient crops, and soil restoration techniques. He added that switching, to some extent, from open field production to protected agriculture could save a significant amount of water, and that greenhouses in hot climates are “particularly suited to offset the effects of climate change,” because growers can control factors such as temperature and humidity. “Greenhouses can yield up to five times the land productivity and seven times the water productivity of open cultivated lands, ” added Martin. Leaving more natural resources untouched can only be a good thing; likewise lowering the requirements to make marginal land arable. “What you need to do is be able to create an environment where you’re reducing the environmental stressors that enable that land to be utilized, said Keppler. “And that’s what products like SecondSky do.” With sales increasing, according to Iyris, and plans to integrate SecondSky into a wider range of products in 2025, the company hopes that beating the heat inside greenhouses around the world can help us beat the heat outside them too."

Here’s what she had to say.                                             ,"Kai Burkhardt, CNN Underscored","Caring about the planet and trying to reduce the impacts of climate change can seem like a daunting task. And if you feel like the clock is ticking, you might be driven to take some action in your own life to lessen your impact on the Earth. While there are many things you can do to help, from driving an electric vehicle to using recycled toilet paper, it can be hard to know what actually makes a difference. That’s why we talked with 19-year-old Harvard student and sustainability entrepreneur Devishi Jha for her favorite tips on living a more planet-friendly life. Jha has been a climate organizer for five years and her concern for the planet started after watching a video on climate change in 6th grade. “I was astounded by the catastrophic impacts that climate change could have on the planet during my lifetime, and was driven to act,” says Jha. “I became an organizer two years later.” Since then she has been a member of the UNICEF USA National Council, partnerships director at Zero Hour and currently serves on the board at the American Lung Association as a climate activist advisor, all while being the co-founder and CEO of Voyagers, a youth-led platform that works with companies to implement sustainable practices. Jha says that any action you take can help in the fight against climate change. “It’s becoming increasingly easier for individuals to take small actions to preserve the planet’s resources. According to the UNEP, Count Us In organizers estimate that if 1 billion people take practical action in their own lives, they could reduce as much as 20% of global carbon emissions,” Jha says. “Everything from shopping with reusable bags, reusing containers, recycling, composting and more play a role in increasing global sustainability.” Jha does a few simple things to reduce her own impact in her day-to-day life. “I personally do not eat red meat, shop using reusable shopping bags, recycle and compost, and try my best to reduce waste and energy consumption whenever possible,” she says. “All of these actions seem small, but together aid in reducing my carbon footprint and impact on the environment.” Jha also recommends going to thrift stores and buying clothes secondhand, along with doing plenty of research when you’re buying from an eco-friendly brand. “Find sustainability reports to look at the actual impact that a company is making on the environment, human rights, DEI and transparency,” she says. “There is a lot of work being done in sustainable reporting in the private sector, namely measuring and reporting sustainability analytics, so ensuring a brand’s environmental impact will likely become easier in the years to come.” To help you get started on reducing your impact, here are some products to help you live a more environmentally-conscious life, either recommended by Jha or one of our own favorites. “I love using reusable bags that fold up and are easy to carry around me when I go shopping — these can be found almost anywhere,” says Jha. We love Baggu’s bags that roll up into a tiny pouch that you can easily toss in any purse or backpack. This stylish tote from Package Free is made from 100% organic and fair trade cotton. One of our favorite reusable bags for grocery shopping sustainably, these bags have a flat bottom that makes loading them in your cart a breeze. Skip the plastic produce bags at the grocery store and use these reusable mesh ones instead. Plus, the mesh makes your produce easy to identify at the register. Whether you want to use this as another tote or as an oversized produce bag for large items like lettuce, this bag is a must. “I also like Patagonia,” says Jha. “Their products are long-lasting and the company is doing good work in ESG and taking accountability for the continued work they have to do as a brand.” We love Patagonia clothes too, especially its Torrentshell jacket, which is our favorite rain jacket. “There are a lot of up and coming startups that I love for their ingenuity in creating sustainable products,” says Jha. “One of my favorites is Bite Toothpaste Bits, which is a great alternative to regular toothpaste and reduces waste while being 100% cruelty free and vegan.” “I’m also a huge chocolate lover, and one of my favorite ethical, sustainable chocolate brands is Tony’s Chocolonely,” says Jha. “Tony’s chocolate is 100% slave-free and works with farmers directly, making sure that all steps of the supply chain in producing to consuming their chocolate is ethical and gives back to local communities.”"
https://www.cnn.com/style/cities-heat-design-dfi/index.html,Cities are hotter than ever. Here are 5 things they can do about it,08-31-2023,"                                                 From deploying mist cannons to painting streets white, here’s what cities are doing right now to combat record temperatures.                                             ","Anne Quito, CNN","Editor’s Note: Design for Impact is a series spotlighting architectural solutions for communities displaced by the climate crisis, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies. It’s been another hellish summer. A double whammy of the human-caused climate crisis and the arrival of El Niño has fueled soaring temperatures that have made this year downright deadly. July 2023 has been declared the world’s hottest month on record. In a recent address, UN Secretary-General António Guterres ominously described this year as the dawning of “the era of global boiling.” In Europe, over 60,000 people died last year from heat-related illnesses, with some countries adopting a naming system for heat waves akin to those used for hurricanes and typhoons. The Italian Meteorological Society, for instance, named a recent heatwave “Cerberus,” after the three-headed hound guarding the gates of hell in Dante’s “Inferno.” Problems are especially acute in densely populated cities where the “urban heat island effect” can result in microclimates about 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than surrounding areas. The phenomenon, first documented in the 1800s by an amateur meteorologist in London, occurs in areas with high concentrations of heat-absorbing concrete buildings, asphalt surfaces and a dearth of green spaces. Despite knowing about the perils of global warming for decades, many cities are proving to be woefully unprepared. Now, local officials are appointing “chief heat officers” to expedite “heat action plans,” while start-ups race to invent better air conditioners and personal cooling devices. Many solutions are based on time-tested design principles. Here are five things cities are doing right now to combat rising temperatures: A healthy canopy of trees is among the most effective and egalitarian defenses against the urban heat island effect. Seeking refuge beneath a tree can feel 11 to 25 degrees Celsius (20 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler compared to standing in direct sunlight, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Apart from the instant relief of shade, a process called “evapotranspiration,” where water transfers from plants and soil into the atmosphere, also helps cool surrounding areas by up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit). Barcelona, which has become something of a laboratory for progressive urban interventions, may soon offer a vital case study on the efficacy of trees. Per its “Tree Master Plan,” the Spanish city aims to blanket 30% of its land with a variety of climate-resilient species by 2037. Today, holm oaks, Aleppo pines, plane trees, cypresses and other hardy species already line the city’s streets and new “superilla,” or superblocks, which are essentially reclaimed roads that have been turned into tree-lined public plazas. Only a handful of the planned 503 superblocks were completed in time for this grueling Spanish summer, though the city plans to finish them all by the end of the decade. In Chinese cities including Wuhan and Chongqing, where temperatures exceeded 113 degrees Fahrenheit last year, cooling sprays can be found in malls, parks and bus stops. The sprays are sometimes complemented by fleets of “mist cannons” — essentially utility trucks equipped with high-pressure water sprayers (pictured above) — that have been roving big cities in China since 2014, according to the environmental think tank China Dialogue. Although these cannons were initially introduced to tackle air pollution, a recent study from Seoul National University suggests that spraying fine water particles can lower ambient temperatures by as much as 7%, especially if misters are positioned at optimal angles. Austria’s capital Vienna has meanwhile designated 22 areas as “cool straßen” (“cool streets”) equipped with drinking fountains, mist showers and smart sprinkler systems that automatically activate when temperatures rise above 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). An awning is a simple and inexpensive weather shield that’s fallen out of fashion due to contemporary architecture’s penchant for sleek facades. But as cities become desperate for quick answers to unrelenting heat, canopies may be coming back in style. The Spanish city of Seville (sometimes known as “the Iberian oven”) has recently expanded its network of large canvas awnings to shield more transit stations, playgrounds, schools and hospitals. In Tel Aviv, Israel, a series of canopies made with LumiWeave, a “smart” cloth  embedded with solar cells, has been installed in the city’s business district. Developed by Israeli product designer Anai Green, the awnings store solar energy during the daytime that is then used to power LED lights woven into the material. As residents of Greek islands can attest, painting rooftops and buildings white is an easy and relatively inexpensive defense against hot summers. Benefiting from something called the “albedo effect,” a structure with a clean white roof reflects around 85% of direct sunlight compared to a dark roof, which reflects only about 20%. Now, a research team at Indiana’s Purdue University claims to have developed a type of “ultra-white” paint that can reflect 98% of sunlight and lower a building’s surface temperature compared to its surroundings by nearly 20 degrees Fahrenheit at night (or by 8 degrees Fahrenheit during strong sunlight). Covering a roof area of around 1,000 square feet in this paint would produce the equivalent of 10 kilowatts of “cooling power,” said Xiulin Ruan, a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue, in a press statement. “That’s more powerful than the central air conditioners used by most houses.” In Los Angeles, the city’s Bureau of Street Services has in recent years been painting roads in a reflective white-gray coating called CoolSeal. In 2019, after a 10- to 15- degree Fahrenheit cooling effect was recorded in pilot areas, LA’s then-mayor Eric Garcetti announced a plan to cover 250 miles of road lanes with cooling material by 2028 — an initiative that will cost the city an estimated $40,000 per mile, according to journal published by the Royal Institute of British Architects. But white isn’t the only cooling pigment. A pilot project in LA’s Pacoima neighborhood is testing the efficacy of street coatings that come in a variety of colors. According to the manufacturer, StreetBond, the acrylic-based colorant is designed to reduce urban heat island effect by at least 10 degrees Fahrenheit. But as cities invest in solar reflective coatings, a 2020 study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters threw cold water on the strategy by suggesting that while reflective sidewalks do result in cooler surface temperatures, humans in these spaces may actually feel warmer because they end up absorbing the heat. “Solar reflective coatings are not a policy panacea for urban heat problems,” the authors wrote, adding that municipalities “need to consider when and how people use land to decide which heat metric (air, surface, or radiant temperature) should be prioritized.” A growing cadre of architects and urbanists are eschewing Western architectural traditions by embracing the natural ventilation, traditional construction techniques and materials like insulating mud bricks that have been used for millennia by those living in hot climates. Pritzker Prize-winning architect Francis Kéré, for instance, creates a sense of airiness through his inventive use of clay, laterite stones, eucalyptus branches and dead wood. School buildings Kéré designed in his native Burkina Faso show how to build comfortable and convivial spaces in extremely hot weather — without the need for AC. In the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the Auroville Earth Institute has become a locus of this burgeoning “vernacular” architecture movement. Over nearly four decades, the research center has been collaborating with architects and builders around the world interested learning how to build economical and low-carbon structures from compressed mud and soil. Compared to concrete, glass and steel, traditional earth bricks absorb more heat and humidity. Indian architect Anupama Kundoo, who has built several structures in Auroville, is known for beautiful, climate-resilient buildings made “with materials sourced on the spot,” as she has described her work. Speaking at last year’s The World Around Summit in the Netherlands, Kundoo made a compelling case for recognizing the unique qualities of a area’s geography — and building with whatever is abundant there. “If you look at pre-industrial architecture, we built with any material,” she explained. “If there was mud, we used mud; if there was wood, we used wood; if it’s a desert and there’s no wood, you build domes; if there’s ice, you use ice.” “There is a deep, deep relationship between what you produce and where you use it,” she added. CNN’s Berry Wang contributed to this story."
https://www.cnn.com/travel/2023-summer-from-hell/index.html,"Heatwaves, wildfires, air chaos and overcrowding. How this year’s summer vacations fell apart",09-17-2023,"                                                 Summer break should be a chance to kick back and relax. For many travelers this year, it quickly descended into the kind of nightmares you need another break to recover from.                                             ","Rob Hodgetts, CNN","From the litany of bad headlines surrounding the world of travel, you could be forgiven thinking it’s been the summer from hell for vacationers. Environmental disasters, aviation industry mishaps and strikes, dirty beaches, soaring temperatures, deluges, price hikes and overcrowding all seem to have conspired to ruin getaways for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people this year. For the most part, the inconvenience of travelers has been nothing compared to the tragic impact some of these situations have had on communities around the world. But, for many people, a summer break is a much-needed annual highlight that offers respite from the stresses not just of everyday life, but other often extreme hardships. Of course, huge numbers of lucky people enjoyed trouble-free vacations around the world. For every angry thread of tweets from airport departure lounges, there were likely many more smiling poolside selfies. It’s the bad news that travels furthest. Here’s a roundup of some of the adversity that vacationers have faced over the past few months: Not everyone wants warm, sunny vacations but even sunseekers would’ve had more than they wished for in early summer, with July 2023 declared by NASA as the Earth’s hottest month since records began in 1880. It didn’t stop there. This summer was later declared the planet’s hottest for years, breaking previous records by a significant margin. Southern Europe sizzled as several fierce heatwaves sent temperatures soaring to near all-time highs, making life uncomfortable and even dangerous for tourists and locals alike. In Italy, red alert heat warnings were issued alongside guidance for tourists and locals about staying hydrated and seeking out shade and aircon. In Athens, authorities closed key tourist sites including the Acropolis during the hottest part of the day. As the heat built, there were already predictions of shifting tourist patterns with one study suggesting tourists planning trips to the Mediterranean region had dropped by 10% year on year, while interest was increasing in cooler climes like Ireland and Denmark. UK travel company Thomas Cook and travel agent association ABTA both told CNN they had seen no discernible difference in July. Meanwhile, the extreme weather kept coming. Hailstones of up to 10 centimeters, or nearly four inches, hit northern Italy’s Veneto region. Phoenix in the US endured a record-breaking 31 consecutive days of 110F-plus (43C) temperatures. America’s national parks, particularly Death Valley, the Grand Canyon and Big Bend in Texas, sweltered, and saw several deaths suspected to be heat-related. At the Grand Canyon, QR codes were posted at trailheads linking to info on water and shelter. In Death Valley signs warned tourists not to hike after 10 a.m. Later in the summer, the same location was closed due to storm flooding. As temperatures in parts of China soared to new records, extreme heat “tourism” saw visitors flocking to the country’s Flaming Mountains in far-western Xinjiang province to experience scorching temperatures emanating from red sandstone cliffs near Turpan. Wearing hats and carrying umbrellas, tourists took selfies by a huge thermometer showing a surface temperature of 80 C (176 F), Chinese state television showed. Inevitably, extreme heat led to extreme wildfires, with tourists and major destinations caught up in some of the worst outbreaks. In July, blazes broke out in Portugal, Spain, Turkey and Greece, where wildfires ripped through Corfu, Evia and the outskirts of Athens. The popular tourist island of Rhodes was most severely affected after a fire began in the centre of the island on July 18 and quickly spread to the east and south coasts, threatening beach resorts. With flames approaching, many tourists and residents were evacuated to makeshift accommodation in sports halls, schools or public buildings on other parts of the island. Nearly 20,000 people were evacuated by land and sea, some unable to retrieve passports and other personal effects. Airlines and tour companies cancelled flights and vacations while empty planes were sent to repatriate stranded tourists. Greece later offered free spring or fall 2024 vacations to those affected. In August, Tenerife, one of Spain’s normally temperate Canary Islands suffered wildfires with more than 12,000 people forced to flee their homes. Fires broke out in Italy’s Sicily, Calabria, Abruzzo and Puglia regions causing evacuations from homes and hotels. Algeria, in north Africa, also suffered. Meanwhile Canada has experienced what experts say was its worst wildfire season in history with more than 1,000 blazes since April. Thousands of people were evacuated across the Northwest Territories and British Columbia, where travel was restricted around the popular tourist destination of Kelowna. The most devastating wildfire of the summer hit Lahaina, the historic town popular with tourists on the Hawaiian island of Maui, on August 8, leaving at least 115 people dead. Hawaii Governor Josh Green called it the worst natural disaster in the state’s history. Many of Lahaina’s historic and cultural landmarks were decimated by the blaze, including the Baldwin Home Museum – an 1830s-era house believed to be the oldest on Maui – the Lahaina Heritage Museum and the Wo Hing Museum. There is hope that the sprawling 150-year-old Banyan tree – a popular focal point - may survive. After the fires came the storms, again wreaking havoc on travel while also causing widespread devastation. Hurricane Hilary crashed into the US west coast in August bringing destructive rainfall and flooding. The desert city of Palm Springs received more rainfall in an hour than it normally does in a year. At the end of summer, Idalia lashed Florida and other southern states just as the Labor Day weekend approached. Parts of Southeast Asia were battered by a number of severe typhoons as storm season hit hard. Typhoons Doksuri, Khanun and Lan came with record rainfall and hurricane-force winds, causing deaths, severe flooding, landslides and widespread power outages. Typhoon Khanun also lashed South Korea with deadly force and led to nearly 40,000 teenagers from 155 countries cutting short the World Scout Jamboree in Saemangeum, south of Seoul, when the threat of the approaching typhoon added to problems caused by the heatwave and conditions at the campsite. When Typhoon Lan hit Japan’s southern Wakayama prefecture on August 15, super-fast bullet trains were heavily disrupted. Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways also scrapped a host of flights. Another consequence of rising heat has been water temperatures also reaching  record highs. While hot tub temperatures of 101.19 F (38.44 C), instead of the usual 80F, recorded on July 25 in Florida’s Manatee Bay might’ve made it uncomfortable for swimmers, they also caused unprecedented mass bleaching and threatened the extinction of coral species on reefs around the Florida Keys. One report from the Coral Restoration Foundation found “100% coral mortality” at Sombrero Reef off the coast of Marathon in the Florida Keys. “This is akin to all of the trees in the rainforest dying,” Keri O’Neil, the director and senior scientist at the Florida Aquarium, told CNN. “Where do all of the other animals that rely on the rainforest go to live? This is the underwater version of the trees in the rainforest disappearing. Corals serve that same fundamental role.” Coral reefs generate billions of dollars for Florida’s economy through fishing and tourism and providing jobs. And it wasn’t just Florida. The Mediterranean Sea reached a record high of 83.1F (28.4C) on July 24, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). The previous record was 28.25C (82.85F) set in 2003. In stark contrast to the searing heat in southern Europe, the UK endured a prolonged spell of mixed and wet weather in July and August, washing out many summer breaks and other sporting and cultural events in Britain. Temperatures only rose in early September when most people’s vacations were over. Experts said the unseasonal weather was down to a blocked weather pattern caused by a kink in the jet stream, the wind that blows west to east high up in the atmosphere. Perhaps an absence of beach weather was a good thing, with British beachgoers and watersports enthusiasts battling increasing issues with water quality because increased sewage dumping at sea is leaving many shorelines too toxic for swimmers. While the frequently creaking US aviation infrastructure held it together over the summer, in Europe there were numerous disruptive events with strikes or threats of strikes by air traffic controllers, pilots or cabin crew leading to thousands of flights being scrapped. In late August, an air traffic control glitch blamed on a single erroneous data point led to UK’s National Air Traffic Services restricting traffic, causing widespread delays and cancellations across the continent for days. The UK has also been hit by an ongoing series of rail strikes in 2023, affecting travelers and commuters alike, while waits at UK international ferry terminals such as Dover have become longer than the pre-Brexit era because of extra time needed for passport control. Despite the hazards and hitches across the globe, tourists were still travelling in droves, perhaps as a rebound from Covid lockdowns. In fact, in some places there were so many visitors that authorities felt the need to limit their numbers. In France, sites such as the spectacular Mont Saint Michel, have been so overwhelmed there are campaigns to send tourists elsewhere or spread visits out over the year. Amsterdam launched an unusual “stay away campaign” in an attempt to curb visits from rowdy young Brits and, along with Venice, considered restrictions on cruise ships. On Japan’s sacred Mount Fuji, crowds were so bad tourists had to line up to reach the summit. Venice, meanwhile, has announced a new 5 euro ($5.40) entry fee for daytrippers to cut numbers. And Greek officials say the number of daily visitors to the Acropolis will be limited from September to preserve the monument. On the Spanish vacation island of Mallorca, a local protest group has claimed to be behind fake signs warning of jellyfish, falling rocks or long walks to reach a nearby beach, saying it’s using them to try to limit overcrowding. Crowds of tourists have been an easy target for scammers in Italy, where visitors have faced rip-off charges for services like cutting a sandwich in half. Meanwhile many locals say their own country is too expensive for a vacation."
https://www.cnn.com/travel/air-turbulence-climate-getting-worse/index.html,Climate change could be about to make flight turbulence a lot worse,05-22-2024,                                                 Severe turbulence can put even seasoned flyers on edge and in extreme cases result in casualties and damage. Experts say climate change will make it worse.                                             ,"Jacopo Prisco, CNN","Most of us have experienced turbulence while traveling: when your plane flies through clashing bodies of air moving at widely different speeds. Severe turbulence can put even the most seasoned flier on edge and make five minutes seem like an eternity. Usually it results in nothing more than a bumpy ride, but in the worst cases it can cause damage, injury and – in the case of Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 on May 21 - fatality. In nonfatal accidents, turbulence is the leading cause of injuries to flight attendants and passengers, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, and it’s one of the most common airline accident types today, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board. It costs US airlines – due to injuries, delays and damages – up to $500 million per year, according to the National Center for Atmospheric Research. “There is a scale for measuring how strong turbulence is,” Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the UK, told CNN in 2022. “There’s light turbulence, which is a bit of strain against your seat belt, but food service can continue and you can probably walk around the cabin, maybe with some difficulty. “Then there’s moderate turbulence, a definite strain against seat belts, anything that’s not secured will be dislodged, and walking is difficult; flight attendants are usually instructed to take their seats. “The worst kind is severe turbulence: This is stronger than gravity, so it can pin you to your seat and if you’re not wearing your seat belt you’ll be tossed around inside the cabin. This is the kind of turbulence that causes serious Injuries – it’s been known to break bones, for example.” About 65,000 aircraft suffer moderate turbulence every year in the US, and about 5,500 run into severe turbulence. These numbers, however, might be destined to grow. Williams believes that climate change is modifying turbulence, and started studying the subject in 2013. “We ran some computer simulations and found that severe turbulence could double or triple in the coming decades,” he says. The findings, which were later confirmed by observations, highlight a type of turbulence called “clear air turbulence,” which isn’t connected to any visual clues such as storms or clouds. Unlike regular turbulence, it hits suddenly and is hard to avoid. Singapore Airlines said investigations are ongoing as to the cause of the incident. According to the NTSB, between 2009 and 2018, the flight crew had no warning in about 28% of turbulence-related accidents. Williams’ analysis predicts that clear-air turbulence will increase significantly around the globe by the period 2050-2080, in particular along the busiest flight routes, and the strongest type of turbulence will increase the most. That doesn’t mean, however, that flying will be less safe. “Planes are not going to start falling out of the sky, because aircraft are built to very high specification and they can withstand the worst turbulence they can ever expect to encounter, even in the future,” says Williams. However, the average duration of turbulence will increase. “Typically, on a transatlantic flight, you might expect 10 minutes of turbulence. I think that in a few decades this may increase to 20 minutes or to half an hour. The seat belt sign will be switched on a lot more, unfortunately for passengers.” Keeping your seat belt fastened at all times while seated is the best way to minimize the risk of injury due to turbulence. Flight attendants, however, are more exposed to that risk than passengers and sustain approximately 80% of all turbulence-related injuries. “We’re the most likely to get hurt because we’re up working, pushing 300-pound carts, even when there’s some sort of warning,” Sara Nelson, a United flight attendant with more than two decades of experience and the president of the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants across 20 airlines, told CNN in 2022. “We have flight attendants who have been thrown into the ceiling and then back down several times, resulting in broken limbs. In the aisle, with unannounced turbulence, we had people who lost toes, or lost the ability to work, or sustained injuries that kept them off the job for years,” she adds. The aviation industry is taking the problem very seriously, Nelson says, but the transition to sustainable fuel must accelerate to tackle the climate crisis, and some regulations need to change. For example, the ability for children under the age of two to fly on their parents’ lap. “That is totally unsafe and our union has been calling for a seat for every person on board,” Nelson says. “Not only can a child be thrown around the cabin, but when they come down they can actually hurt someone else, too. When a child is born, you can’t leave the hospital unless you have a properly installed car seat. The same standards must be applied to flying.” The NTSB held a public meeting about turbulence in 2021, during which it offered the same recommendation, along with more stringent rules about fastening seat belts for both passengers and flight attendants when the aircraft is flying in the vicinity of thunderstorms and under 20,000 feet, as most injuries occur under these conditions. It also recommended to streamline the systems for collecting and sharing turbulence reports, because that information isn’t traveling widely or promptly enough at the moment. While the effects of climate change on turbulence will take many years to become obvious, Nelson believes some worsening has already occurred. “This is of course anecdotal, but from Hurricane Katrina forward there seems to have been a pickup in the activity of turbulence, especially turbulence that comes with no warning,” she says. Her worst ever turbulence experience occurred during a flight to Dallas, which was eventually diverted. “When anything happens on the plane, the passengers look to us, to see if we look concerned,” she adds. “I was flying with a very good friend of mine and we were strapped in on the jump seats, facing the back of the aircraft – so there was a lavatory in front of us, instead of passengers. “Thank goodness, because we were clutching each other and we were getting thrown around in our seats so violently that it felt like our brains were getting scrambled. It went on for a very long time, but luckily we got safely on the ground,” she says. “Typically I’m not scared of turbulence, because it’s something that we’re taught about in training and we know what to do to protect ourselves. But it is possible to have turbulence so bad and go on for so long that even knowing all of that, my friend and I were praying – and I have to say I was scared for my life.” CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect that the cause of the turbulence that hit the Singapore Airlines is yet to be determined and that investigations are ongoing. This story was originally published in September 2022.

","Alex Stambaugh and Nectar Gan, CNN","Ancient Buddhist murals and statues in caves along China’s Silk Road are under “direct threat” from extreme rainfall brought by climate change, researchers have found. Dating back to the 4th century, the Dunhuang cave temples in the northwestern province of Gansu have withstood wars, earthquakes, sandstorms and vandalism for more than a millennium. But now, changing weather patterns in the desert are posing significant damage to the fragile wall paintings and sculptures – including at the famous Mogao Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, according to a report released Monday by Greenpeace. “Gansu is famous for its caves and the art stored inside them for centuries,” said Li Zhao, a senior researcher in Greenpeace East Asia’s Beijing office. “Increased bouts of rainfall in the desert pose an acute risk. Spikes in humidity, flash floods, and cave ins are already happening.” Over the past two decades, Gansu has seen an increase in total rainfall but a drop in the number of rainy days, resulting in more bouts of intense downpours. Temperatures in the province have also been rising faster than the global average, according to the report. The artworks in some caves, including the Mogao Grotto, have already shown signs of deterioration. And some artifacts could be gone in a few years, the report warned. Rising humidity has accelerated the crystallization and build up of salt on the murals’ surface, causing them to flake and peel. Rainwater leaks have also eroded the paintings, while flash floods and mudslides caused some caves to collapse, the report added. The report comes as China is conducting its fourth nationwide cultural heritage survey to log the state of the country’s historical artifacts. But Li warned that by the time the survey is completed, some of Gansu’s precious artifacts could already be gone. “While we’re still working to document, understand, and conserve these pieces of our history, they’re dissolved before our very eyes. This is a painful reality of the impact of climate change,” Li said. “The sites we looked at include some of the most well-funded, best-staffed cultural heritage sites in China. There are hundreds of less-funded, less-studied sites all around China that are facing these same risks.” In October 2021, heavy downpours and flooding hit the northern province of Shanxi, causing the collapse of the Jinci Temple and Tianlongshan grottoes, both national heritage sites, Chinese state media reported at the time. A total of 1,783 cultural relic sites were affected, according to Shanxi authorities. Li said Chinese officials and academics are increasingly aware of the threats of the climate crisis on the country’s cultural heritage sites. But when it comes to concrete actions – both in terms of monitoring the impact and protective measures, it is only the beginning, she added. Unlike Dunhuang, many historical sites lack long-term monitoring data to research the impacts of climate change, Li said. The Dunhuang Academy has decades of data on the temperature, humidity and wind speed both inside and outside the caves, thanks to its international cooperation projects that began in the 1960s, she added. “The data can paint a clear picture on the impacts of environmental changes on the cultural relics. But in many other places, monitoring work has only just started in recent years,” Li said. CNN’s Mengcheng Zhang and Candice Zhu contributed reporting."

","Heather Chen, CNN","Temperatures in China’s northernmost city plunged to minus 53°C (minus 63.4 degrees Fahrenheit) – its coldest ever recorded, meteorologists said. Located in the northeastern Heilongjiang province and nestled near Russian Siberia, Mohe is widely known as “China’s North Pole” and is one of the few places in the country to have a subarctic climate. The temperature at 7am on January 22, also the first day of the Lunar New Year, registered at minus 53°C, according to the Heilongjiang Meteorological Bureau. It beat its previous record of minus 52.3°C in 1969, officials said. China’s meteorological authority has forecast big temperature drops in parts of the country and issued a blue cold wave on Monday. In neighboring Russia, Yakutsk, which has the distinction of being the world’s coldest city, saw temperatures plunge to minus 62.7°C (minus 80.9 degrees Fahrenheit) – the coldest in more than two decades. Winters in Mohe are long and begin in early October, often lasting until May. Average temperatures during this period have been known to dip below freezing, experts said. In 2018, rare “ice fog” – a weather phenomenon that occurs only in extreme cold climates when water droplets in air remain in liquid form – gripped residents, prompting local authorities to issue the city’s first-ever red warning for cold weather. No alerts have been issued in Mohe yet but local meteorologists say the cold snap would continue into this week. Ice fog is also expected, they said. The city’s constant cold attracts tourists all year round, who flock to its ice-themed attractions. In 2011, more than 10,000 tourists flocked to the city to observe the aurora borealis during the annual polar lights festival. A highway connecting the remote city to the capital Beijing opened in December 2019 to much fanfare. Climate change has worsened the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Just months ago, China saw its worst heat wave since 1961 – which prompted massive power cuts and even reduced rivers to drought levels. The extreme heat stretched over 70 days and the impact was felt far and wide throughout large swathes of the country. In the southwestern province of Sichuan, home to 80 million people, electricity cuts shut factories and plunged homes and offices into rolling blackouts – also killing thousands of poultry and fish at farms."

And as heatwaves become more frequent, the problem could extend to more flights.                                             ","Jacopo Prisco, CNN","Our planet’s rising temperatures are making it harder for planes to take off at certain airports, presenting yet another challenge to civil aviation. And as heatwaves become more frequent, the problem could extend to more flights, forcing airlines to leave passengers on the ground. “The basic challenge facing any aircraft as it takes off is that planes are just very heavy, and gravity wants to keep them on the ground,” says Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the UK. “In order to overcome gravity, they need to generate lift, which is the atmosphere pushing the plane up. “Lift depends on several factors, but one of the most important is the temperature of the air – and as the air warms up it expands, so the number of molecules available to push the plane up is reduced. Planes get 1% less lift with every 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) of temperature rise, Williams said. “That’s why extreme heat makes it harder for planes to take off – and in some really extreme conditions that can become impossible altogether,” he said. The problem particularly affects airports at high altitude, where the air is already naturally thinner, and with short runways, which leave the plane with less room to accelerate. According to Williams, if a plane requires 6,500 feet of runway at 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), it’s going to require 8,200 feet at 104 degrees (40 Celsius). Williams and his team researched historical data from 10 Greece airports, all of which were characterized by high summer temperatures and short runways. They found a warming of 1.35 degrees Fahrenheit (0.75 Celsius) per decade since the 1970s. “We also found a decrease in headwind along the runway, by 2.3 knots per decade,” Williams said. “Headwind is beneficial for takeoffs, and there’s some evidence that climate change is causing what’s called ‘global stilling,’ which is why the winds seem to be slowing down.” The team then put those temperatures and headwinds into an aircraft takeoff performance calculator for a variety of different aircraft types, including the Airbus A320 – one of the most popular planes in the world. “What we found was that the maximum takeoff weight has been reduced by 280 pounds (127 kilograms) each year – that’s roughly equivalent to the weight of one passenger plus their suitcase, meaning one less passenger each year that can be carried,” Williams says. From its introduction in 1988 up until 2017, the A320 would have seen its maximum takeoff weight reduced by over 8,000 pounds at Chios Island National airport, the main airport in the study, which has a runway length of just under 5,000 feet (1,500 meters). London’s City Airport, in the UK capital’s financial district, also has a runway that’s just under 5,000 feet in length. During a heatwave in 2018, more than a dozen flights were forced to leave passengers on the ground in order to take off safely. One flight saw as many as 20 people bumped. In 2017, dozens of flights were canceled entirely over a few days at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor International airport, as temperatures reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.8 Celsius), which is above the maximum operating temperature for many passenger planes. A study from Columbia University predicts that by 2050, a typical narrowbody aircraft like the Boeing 737 will incur increased weight restrictions by anything from 50% to 200% during the summer months at four major US airports: La Guardia, Reagan National Airport, Denver International and Sky Harbor. Luckily, airlines are not powerless against the issue. “There are lots of solutions on the table,” says Williams. “One would be to schedule departures away from the hottest part of the day, with more early morning and late evening departures, which is a tactic already used in hot areas like the Middle East.” Lighter aircraft are also less affected by the problem, so this could accelerate the adoption of composite materials such as carbon fiber for airframes, Williams says. In the meantime, manufacturers like Boeing are already offering a “hot and high” option on some of their aircraft, for airlines planning to use them extensively in high altitude, high temperature airports. The option provides extra thrust and larger aerodynamic surfaces to make up for the loss of lift, with no change to range or passenger capacity. Of course, a more drastic approach would be to lengthen runways, although this might not be possible at all airports. In some cases, where none of these solutions are applicable, passengers will simply have to give up their seats. But, says Williams, this will remain a niche problem for the near future, at least: “People being bumped off aircraft because it’s too hot is rare and will remain rare. Most planes are never at their maximum takeoff weight, so this will happen in marginal cases – mostly airports with short runways, at high altitude, and in the summer,” he says. However, the longer-term future may be more difficult, he adds: “I don’t think it’s going to be a major headache for the industry, but I do think the evidence is strong that it will get worse.” (Top image: High temperatures and heat waves distort the image of a passenger jet as it taxis for takeoff at Washington, DC’s Ronald Reagan National Airport in August 2002.

https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/contrails-aviation-climate-change-satavia-scn-spc-intl/index.html,Contrails are a problem for aviation – but there could be an easy solution,01/12/2023,"                                                 Contrails are a major factor in aviation’s contribution to climate change. But UK company Satavia is trying prevent much of the impact, by slightly changing the path of certain flights.                                             ","Jacopo Prisco, CNN","On a clear day, with the right weather conditions, a portion of the sky busy with commercial flights can become riddled with contrails, the wispy ice clouds that form as jet aircraft fly by. They might look innocuous, but they’re not – contrails are surprisingly bad for the environment. A study that looked at aviation’s contribution to climate change between 2000 and 2018 concluded that contrails create 57% of the sector’s warming impact, significantly more than the CO2 emissions from burning fuel. They do so by trapping heat that would otherwise be released into space. And yet, the problem may have an apparently straightforward solution. Contrails – short for condensation trails, which form when water vapor condenses into ice crystals around the small particles emitted by jet engines – require cold and humid atmospheric conditions, and don’t always stay around for long. Researchers say that by targeting specific flights that have a high chance of producing contrails, and varying their flight path ever so slightly, much of the damage could be prevented. Adam Durant, a volcanologist and entrepreneur based in the UK, is aiming to do just that. “We could, in theory, solve this problem for aviation within one or two years,” he says. Durant has long studied how atmospheric contaminants affect the health of aircraft engines, and after the 2010 eruption of an Icelandic volcano brought aviation to a standstill, he embarked on a project with Airbus and easyJet to research volcanic ash. In 2013 he founded his own company, Satavia, initially focusing on preserving engines from damaging pollutants like dust, ice and volcanic ash. “Then, Covid shifted the priorities of the whole industry towards sustainability,” he says. Satavia pivoted to tackling contrails, by developing a weather prediction model that can forecast the conditions that lead to their formation. Of contrails’ climate impact, “80 or 90% is coming from only maybe five to 10% of all flights,” says Durant. “Simply redirecting a small proportion of flights can actually save the majority of the contrail climate impact.” The approach Satavia is taking is to target those five to 10% of flights on any given day and modify their flight plans before the aircraft have even taken off. That means changing their altitude or route to avoid flying through parts of the atmosphere which are prone to forming persistent contrails. “The airlines go ahead and make flight plans as they normally do. But in parallel to that, we analyze their schedule and look at a number of flow trajectories for every single flight,” Durant says. “We end up with a long list of flights of which the top 5% or so have these heavy hitter, long-lived warming contrails. And then we work closely with the flight ops department in the airline to target those.” The challenge is working around limitations on flight time and fuel consumption. “There are obviously very tight limits on flight time: we have to stay within five minutes of the original intended arrival time. That’s non-negotiable,” Durant says. As for fuel use, Durant aims to either have no impact on consumption, or keep it within tenths of a percent of the regular flight plan. “If a particular flight has a 0.1 or 0.2% fuel penalty to save potentially hundreds of tons of CO2, that’s fairly negligible but the benefits are huge. There’s a big upside to this if it’s done in the correct way.” The first commercial flight utilizing Satavia technology took off in October 2021 and was operated by United Arab Emirates carrier Etihad as part of a program called Greenliner, a testbed for sustainability projects. Since then, Etihad and Satavia have completed dozens of flights, and Satavia is about to start another trial with Dutch flagship operator KLM. “We are going to be actively looking for more airlines in 2023 to work with, as we start scaling up the service that we offer,” Durant says. In 2021, scientists calculated that addressing the contrail problem would cost under $1 billion a year, but provide benefits worth more than 1,000 times as much. And a study from Imperial College London showed that diverting just 1.7% of flights could reduce the climate damage of contrails by as much as 59%. According to Marc Stettler, one of the authors of the Imperial College study, who’s not involved with Satavia, the company is on the right track. “I’m all in favor of conducting trials. There are things that we still need to improve and learn, but the industry has started to rightly take this as a high priority, so there’s a number of airlines who are active in this space, including the ones that are working with Satavia,” he says. However, he adds, the problem requires a concerted effort. “This needs to be collaborative. Satavia are doing good work by initiating these trials themselves and they have to be able to sustain themselves as a commercial organization, but they’re open for collaboration.” In late November, the Rocky Mountain Institute, a non-profit energy think tank based in the US, launched a cross sector task force to address the contrail problem. Boeing, Airbus and a half dozen airlines including American and United are currently on board, along with researchers and academics. It aims to develop solutions and establish a roadmap to implement them. Durant is receptive to the idea of collaboration. “We really need action across the industry, we need the operators to come together and work with us. We could do something tangible. We could seriously reduce, say, 50% of the industry’s contrails impact by 2030. That’s totally attainable, because we can do it with software and analytics,” he says. The challenges ahead, Durant adds, can’t be solved without the involvement of regulatory bodies. “It’s not just about the science – it’s also about how we do this in practice. The rules will need to be updated to allow greater flexibility for both where aircraft fly and how we organize air traffic. And that’s going to be our biggest problem to solve.”"

When traveling on business, the Institute supports its employees in traveling in a climate-friendly manner.” When asked about Grimalda’s claim that his September salary was unpaid, the Kiel Institute said that it would not publicly comment on an “internal personnel matter… for the protection of our employees.” An experimental economist and campaigner with Scientist Rebellion, Grimalda had been carrying out fieldwork in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea for six months, studying the relationship between globalization, climate change and social cohesion. Grimalda’s permission for traveling ended on September 10 but his research took longer than originally planned due to several security threats – including one occasion when he was held hostage by a group armed with machetes and all his belongings were confiscated, Scientist Rebellion’s statement said. As the climate crisis intensifies, the impact of aviation has come under increasing scrutiny. Commercial aviation causes 2.5% of global CO2 emissions each year, with flight demand – and emissions – forecast to increase significantly in the coming years. As an alternative, climate activists such as Greta Thunberg have modeled greener ways to travel such as by ship or train. “I am prepared to face all the legal and economic consequences of this decision,” Grimalda said in a statement. “Ultimately it’s also a mental health issue. My psychological state can’t but be described as one of climate anxiety, and flying can’t but worsen this condition.” It took Grimalda 35 days to reach Papua New Guinea from Germany earlier this year, as he traveled 15,000 kilometers (9,321 miles) overland to Singapore before taking a flight for the second leg of the trip. He is currently still in Papua New Guinea before he leaves on a cargo ship on October 8 for his long trip back to Germany. CNN’s Laura Paddison contributed reporting."

The winners were announced last night at a ceremony at London’s Royal Geographical Society, ahead of an exhibition at the same location showcasing the evocative imagery. Photographers Jean-Marc Caimi and Valentina Piccinni took the top prize with their “Tropicalia” series, which documents how Sicilian farmers are adapting in response to climate change. “Rising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, and an increased risk of extreme events have transformed what was once Europe’s breadbasket into a testing ground for adaptation and survival,” they said in a press release. Their images show how farmers are having to diversify: some are giving up their fields to solar energy systems, while others are pivoting to grow exotic fruits such as avocadoes and mangoes that thrive in the now tropical environment. “Each inspiring image highlights the important stories of resistance, innovation and resilience at the frontline of climate change,” Louise Fedotov-Clements, head of Earth Photo’s jury and director of Photoworks UK, told CNN. “The series as a whole serves as an example of the future that awaits the whole continent.” Other winning imagery depicts possible climate solutions, including Jennifer Adler’s “Corals of the Future” series that focuses on ocean science and the efforts to restore marine ecosystems in the world’s largest underwater coral nursery. A short film, “Ser Guardianes Madre Arbol” (“Becoming Guardians of Mother Tree”), by Marc Lathuillière, celebrates an indigenous community in northern Colombia that is fighting for the protection of rainforest and their ancestral lands. The works highlight “the beauty, fragility, crisis and change happening in our natural environment,” said Mike Seddon, chief executive of Forestry England, in a press release. “Bringing us closer to landscapes, wildlife and communities from across the planet in this way sparks new conversations and reflections. And it prompts us to focus on the creative solutions needed for these environments to flourish beyond our lifetimes.” Fedotov-Clements added that photography and film “represent a formidable means for raising awareness that can encourage us to adapt, innovate and invent sustainable solutions.” “From the impact of climate change to the inspiring stories of resilience, this year’s powerful edition is sure to inspire stimulating dialogues about our environment,” she said."

All three scenes were among the winning images of the Environmental Photographer of the Year 2023 competition, and all three were taken in Bangladesh. The country is one of the most vulnerable to climate change in the world, ranking seventh on the latest Global Climate Risk Index, based on data from 2000 to 2019. It’s prone to cyclones, tornadoes and floods, and it is estimated that by 2050, one in every seven people in Bangladesh will be displaced by climate change. Bangladeshi photographers like Shafiul Islam believe they have a responsibility to highlight these threats. His captivating image of buffalo depicts the droughts that have struck the north of the country in recent decades. Rivers, canals and reservoirs in the area have dried up, crop production is decreasing and local communities are suffering as a result, he says. When it does rain, it pours – as shown in 18-year-old Solayman Hossain’s photo of a farmer navigating floodwaters during monsoon season in the Kushtia district, in the west of the country. Brought up in a nearby village, Hossain recounts how he has witnessed devastating changes to the environment in his lifetime. “My village has been hit with frequent flooding and cyclones which damage crops and destroy livelihoods,” he tells CNN. As extreme weather events become more and more frequent so does the damage, displacements, and anxiety around when the next disaster will hit. “Many of us are forced to keep rebuilding our lives, often in the aftermath of each calamity,” he says. Now in its 16th year, the photo competition – organized by streaming platform WaterBear and the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management and in partnership with Nikon – attracted thousands of submissions from over 159 countries. So it may seem surprising that three of the six category winners hailed from one country. Sam Sutaria, CEO of WaterBear, believes it’s down to the country’s relationship with climate issues. “Bangladesh is a place where the climate crisis isn’t an abstract concept but a harsh and immediate reality. With frequent flooding, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events, it’s no wonder they’re so engaged in documenting these challenges,” he says. He adds that this year’s competition saw entries from other regions also severely threatened by climate change, such as India, West Bengal, Antarctica and Argentina. “(It proves) that photographers on the front lines of these crises are using their lenses as a force for change. They’re inspiring awareness and action by showcasing the pressing issues they face daily.” Jahid Apu, a professional photographer from Bangladesh, took the drone shot of a bridge in the capital Dhaka surrounded by plastic waste that won the “MPB vision of the future” category. With the image, he wants to communicate the impact of plastic pollution and hopes that when people see it, they might realize the consequence of throwing away plastic and change their behavior. “I do not take pride in a photo that someone looks at and says, ‘Wow, pretty picture…’ and moves on. For me, success is achieved when I catch the person off guard, drawing consciousness about causes, or when someone comes to me to tell me what the photograph brings to mind,” Apu tells CNN. Sutaria believes that the winning images from this year’s prize represent a wider shift in environmental photography, away from simply portraying nature as an untouched paradise to images that carry a conservation message. “They’re showing it in all its raw, vulnerable glory, challenging us to step up and protect it,” he says. “These photographs represent a dynamic new wave in climate storytelling.”"

Here’s some tips for making your travel greener.                                             ,Brendan Canavan,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. Being an environmentally friendly tourist can be challenging. Tourism is an industry that brings many negative environmental impacts – our pleasure often comes at the expense of local habitats or wildlife. Maya Bay on Thailand’s uninhabited Ko Phi Phi Leh island became famous as the location of the 2000 Hollywood movie “The Beach.” But this led to rapid growth in visitors to the bay – as many as 8,000 a day at its peak – and put enormous strain on the bay’s natural habitats. In 2018, the bay was closed to tourists for four years to let its coral reefs and wildlife recover. But tourism can also be an inspiring way to connect with oneself, with others and with new places. As tourists, we can learn, share and contribute to positive environmental practices. As a tourist, you also have influence. The money you spend, the social interactions you have and the resources you consume all help to shape an area. So here are four pieces of advice for making your next vacation better for the environment. We’ve all heard variations on the mantra “take only memories, leave only footprints”. This message of less consumption and lower impact is a good ethos for environmentally sensitive tourism. The first thing to do is think about how you can leave more positive footprints behind. An excellent way to make the most of your economic footprint is to stay and shop in independent businesses. These businesses tend to pay local taxes and are owned by and employ local people. More of the money you spend stays in the immediate area as a result. Where tourist money directly benefits local people and businesses, their support for conservation is often encouraged. Tourists visiting rhino sanctuaries in Botswana, for example, bring income and support jobs. In 2010, the country’s Khama Rhino Sanctuary employed 26 permanent staff and many more casual laborers. This economic security can, in turn, prompt local people to appreciate the importance of protecting vulnerable animal species like rhinos. Separate research on people living around Kenya’s Maasai Mara nature reserve found that people whose livelihoods were dependent on tourism were more likely to support efforts to conserve local wildlife. Tourism creates waste and uses up resources. Treading carefully will minimise the environmental impact you have on your vacation destination. A simple way to lower your environmental footprint is to use fewer resources at every stage of your vacation. A single tourist uses 300 liters of water in their holiday accommodation on average each night. Reusing towels, flushing the toilet less and shortening your shower time can all help to reduce demand for water resources. Thinking about the footprints you leave as a tourist is a useful mindset. You may even become more aware of the positive legacy you can leave behind. Learn about the local area and the environmental issues that matter there. If habitat loss is a problem, contribute to local organisations that support conservation. Organisations like the National Trust even offer vacations in the UK that help to fund their work. Tourism shifts you away from the familiar and gives you space for self-reflection. Research has found that people have been inspired by travel to make life changes such as relocating or shifting career. Many keen rock climbers, for instance, adopt a minimalist and mobile lifestyle. One study on climbers’ lifestyles in the US showed that the challenges of life on the road, gatherings at campgrounds and the considerable amount of time spent in nature can be enriching. Rock climbers’ lifestyles are inspired by and connected to natural settings. And many alternative types of tourism are too. These tourists can become powerful advocates for the protection of the places they care deeply about. Surf tourists, for example, have driven various campaigns against the discharge of sewage into UK bathing waters. You and those you travel with can be similar cheerleaders for the places you care about. Join organizations fighting for their conservation, contribute to their sustainable development and share your appreciation of these places with others. A final thing you can do as a tourist is to keep exploring. It can be tempting to stay in a tourist bubble and not leave the confines of your resort or stick with familiar travel groups and activities. Cruises are a classic example of bubble tourism. The places visited do not really matter; the floating hotel is the main attraction. But cruise tourism rarely benefits local populations and brings significant negative environmental impacts. In the Trujillo Bay area of Honduras, for example, increases in garbage and sewage have been reported since commercial cruise tourism began operating in the area in 2014. Similar concerns have prompted calls to restrict cruise tourism in popular European destinations like Venice, Marseille and Barcelona. In 2022, more than 50,000 people signed a petition to ban cruise ships from Marseille. Going beyond familiar or fashionable tourist bubbles can help you avoid such negative associations. Short-haul city breaks are a more environmentally friendly option. Travelers to these destinations are more likely to use means of transportation that are associated with less CO₂ emissions than long-haul travel, such as trains or coaches. And in urban areas, their activities are likely to take place in a concentrated geographical area. Thinking about the footprints you leave and the memories you take can help you to become a more environmentally aware tourist. Leave positive imprints behind, tread carefully, put yourself out there and keep exploring. This is a mantra to adopt and share with your travel groups to get the most out of your holiday experiences while simultaneously reducing your impact on the planet. Editor’s Note: Brendan Canavan is a senior lecturer in marketing at the University of Nottingham."

The Chinese capital’s previous record was 26 days, set in 2000. The sweltering heat is occurring as envoys from China and the United States - the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters - have been holding intense, marathon talks in Beijing this week on fighting climate change."
https://www.cnn.com/travel/heatwave-travel-tourist-advice-explainer/index.html,Traveling to a heat wave zone: Here’s what tourists need to know,07-19-2023,                                                 Scorching hot temperatures are breaking records and wreaking havoc across some of the world’s most popular tourism destinations. Is it time to rethink travel plans? Are refunds available? Are there ways to cope?                                             ,CNN Travel staff,"Scorching hot temperatures have been breaking records and wreaking havoc across some of the world’s most popular tourism destinations. Is it time to rethink travel plans? Are refunds available? Are there ways to cope? Here are some answers to many of the key questions travelers may be asking when potentially dangerous conditions are likely to affect their vacation. A number of destinations across the United States, Europe and Asia have been significantly impacted by soaring global temperatures. In the US, temperatures in Death Valley, which runs along part of central California’s border with Nevada and is known as “the hottest place on Earth,” reached 128 Fahrenheit (53.3 Celsius) on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. Travelers in Texas and Florida have also been faced with especially hot weather in recent weeks, while temperatures in Phoenix jumped to 114 F at the weekend. Tuesday marked the 19th-consecutive day a reading of 110 F or more was recorded in the capital of Arizona. In Europe, health warnings have been issued by officials in countries such as Italy and France due to the extreme weather. Italy’s health ministry has issued red weather alerts, which signal a potential health threat for those exposed to the heat, in at least 23 cities as temperatures on Tuesday reached 112 F (44 C) in Sardinia and 104 F (40 C) in Rome. Several tourists have collapsed due to heat stroke, including a British citizen who passed out near the ancient Roman Colosseum on Tuesday. The heat has also been intensifying in Spain, where an extreme warning has been issued in popular holiday spot Mallorca as temperatures are predicted to reach up to 109 F (43 C) . Wildfires have been burning in La Palma, located in the Canary Islands, which has seen up to 4,000 people evacuated from their homes. Last week, the Greek Culture Ministry went as far as to shut the Acropolis in Athens from midday local time until 5 p.m. as a result of the heat, and authorities have suggested that temperatures could top 111.2 F (44 C) by the end of the week. China recorded its highest temperature ever on Sunday, as the extreme weather led to the heat soaring to nearly 126 F (52 C) in northwestern Xinjiang province. Global temperature records have been continually broken in recent weeks as the hottest days ever are logged, and this seems likely to continue as the heat intensifies in numerous countries around the world. According to preliminary figures from the World Meteorological Organization, June saw the warmest global average temperature on record, and this has continued into July. “The extreme weather – an increasingly frequent occurrence in our warming climate – is having a major impact on human health, ecosystems, economies, agriculture, energy and water supplies,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas. “This underlines the increasing urgency of cutting greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and as deeply as possible.” While there’s no denying that summers are hot in cities such as Phoenix, Arizona, current temperatures appear to be higher than usual, and the heat waves are certainly becoming more intense. In 2022, the hottest day recorded in Phoenix was July 15, when temperatures soared to around 114 F. However, current predictions suggest that this will be exceeded as the city marks 19 days of temperatures of around 110 F or more. Meanwhile, temperatures are predicted to reach close to 120 F (48.9 C) in either Sicily or Sardinia in the coming days, which would smash Europe’s hottest-ever logged temperature, thought to be 119.8 F (48.8 C), which was recorded near Syracuse on the coast of Sicily in August 2021. If you’re planning to visit one of the affected destinations, whether for leisure or business, it’s very unlikely you’ll be able to stick to your original travel plans. In areas with scorching temperatures, travelers may struggle to sightsee at their usual pace and may need to adapt or scrap itineraries. This will be even more important for people with chronic health conditions or in high-risk categories, such as older people and young children. Anyone visiting an area at risk of floods, wildfire or typhoons could potentially find tourist destinations closed or even being evacuated. It’s important to pay very close attention to local government safety advice and heed recommendations. While many vacations will be possible so long as advice is followed and precautions are taken, in certain circumstances it may be advisable to cancel or reschedule your trips. Try to get out and about first thing in the morning – the temperatures start building at around 11 a.m. Although conventional wisdom suggests that midday is the hottest time of the day, in reality, the heat keeps building until early evening – and temperatures in the afternoon are far more suffocating than in the morning. Wash hands and wrists – and ideally face and arms – with cool water as often as possible (in Europe, fountains should make this easy). Take cool showers when you can, and try to air-dry if possible. Italian authorities are advising residents to spend at least three hours a day in an air-conditioned environment – so if you’re sightseeing, find a cool museum, gallery or restaurant to take refuge in. Wear loose, light clothing made of lightweight materials. Don’t forget sunscreen – and reapply it regularly. And use a fan – yes, even a handheld one can make a huge difference in how you feel. Drink more water than usual, the CDC advises, and don’t wait until you feel thirsty to drink. When it’s time to eat, prioritize water-filled foods – raw vegetables and salads, or fruits such as watermelon or grapes. If you’re asthmatic, or have other chronic health conditions that can be worsened by heat or humidity, it’s worth seeking medical advice about how best to tackle your trip. Check whether the place you’re staying has air conditioning – if you fall into a high risk category, that will be crucial. Finally, make sure you have travel insurance that covers medical expenses. That way, if you need treatment for heat-related illnesses, you’ll be covered. If you’re in a high-risk category and your doctor advises you not to travel, you should be able to cancel on insurance, too. Health risks are potentially very severe, although some people will just experience discomfort. Extreme heat can cause a number of medical issues that can be serious or even lead to death. Nearly 62,000 people are reported to have died heat-related deaths during 2022’s Europe-wide heat wave. In the US, more than 700 people die from extreme heat annually, according to the CDC. Heat stroke and heat exhaustion are the biggest risks. If you see any of the symptoms below, the CDC advises seeking immediate medical attention. Heat stroke symptoms include a body temperature over 103 Fahrenheit (39.4 Celsius), hot and red skin without sweating, headaches and dizziness, upset stomachs and passing out. Sufferers should cool with fanning and cool water on the skin rather than take in more fluids, according to the CDC. Heat exhaustion is marked by heavy sweating, muscle cramps, exhaustion and pale skin. Sufferers can also have headaches, dizziness, upset stomachs and can faint. The CDC outlines (pdf) steps to take to treat heat-related illness symptoms while you await medical attention. Those with chronic health conditions, as well as older people, young children and infants are at higher risk. Anyone with asthma or other breathing difficulties should be aware that it’s not just wildfires that can worsen their condition. Humidity – as seen in much of Europe, particularly Italy – can have the same effect. Pretty much all transport can be affected by extreme temperatures and in surprising ways. A heat wave can lead to passengers being bumped off their scheduled flight because the plane has become too heavy to take off. Train tracks and even roads can buckle in extreme heat – in 2022, preventative measures in London included painting rail tracks white and wrapping a bridge in foil. Highways may be blocked off in areas that are prone to flash flooding or at risk of wildfires. Pipe bursts can also increase in dry, hot weather due to ground shifts, leading to yet more unexpected diversions. Even if your journey on public transport proceeds on schedule, you could be in for a very sticky trip if the buses or trains in your destination don’t have air conditioning – or it breaks down. If you have to hit the road, make sure you have plenty of water and appropriate snacks and be prepared for things not going according to plan. As with most meteorological events, heat waves are not typically covered by travel insurance companies and so no compensation will be offered if you cancel your trip because of rising temperatures. The situation would change if an official advisory was issued warning against travel, but that’s highly unlikely and many insurance policies do not cover natural catastrophes. There may be some provision for people with pre-existing medical conditions exacerbated by heat. That said, if the heat causes cancelation of flights or delays, some level of assistance may be offered. Likewise airlines may offer refunds or rescheduling/rerouting options. Depending on who it’s been booked with and what payments have been made, some hotel stays may be cancelable without incurring any charges. It’s worth checking terms and conditions. When it’s scorching outside, the cooling blast of air conditioning is a much-welcomed source of relief. But while in the US it’s normal for many homes, hotels, restaurants and public buildings to be equipped with aircon, in Europe it’s less common. A 2018 study from the International Energy Agency found less than 10% of households in Europe have AC, compared to 90% in the US. So if you’re staying in an Airbnb, don’t expect an aircon unit unless it’s specified in the listing. European buildings are also often older than their US counterparts, and were built to to keep heat in, leading to uncomfortable conditions in soaring temperatures. European hotels are more likely to have cooling systems, but it still depends on the size of the property. Expect AC in larger hotels in cities, but it’s less likely in a small beachside bolthole. Public transport is also hit and miss. Unsurprisingly, underground lines are often some of the hottest spots in a heat wave – although some have aircon. It’s worth planning ahead – travel app Citymapper, for example, allows users to specify public transport routes with air conditioning. Aircon is usually found in European cinemas – certainly larger multiplexes. With two of the biggest movies of the year released at the height of 2023 summer heat wave – “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” – this could be a good option for heat relief. If you’re hoping to travel in August and banking on the weather cooling off by then, it’s worth keeping a close eye on updates. At present, there doesn’t seem to be any guarantee the global heat wave will wane any time soon. The latest update from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) states there “is no immediate respite in sight” in Europe.” The same update said “a further continuation into August is possible.” In the southwestern United States, what the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center terms the “threatening heat” will continue until at least July 28, with high temperatures also hitting the south-central and Southeast of the US. Julia Buckley, Tamara Hardingham-Gill, Barry Neild, Maureen O’Hare and Francesca Street contributed to this story."

But a new era of ghost towns is now emerging that, while eerie, feels far off from good touristic fun.                                             ","Elissa Garay, CNN","Think of “ghost towns” and images of dusty, lost-to-time towns, like those in America’s Wild West, may come to mind. Indeed, in the second half of the 19th century, a slew of boomtown-gone-bust mining towns were deserted by residents as natural resources and economic viability dried up. Over time, some of these relics have found new life as fun and kitschy tourist attractions. And while iterations of such abandoned settlements are found on every continent, with varying manmade and natural causes to blame, a new era of ghost towns is now emerging that, while eerie, feels far off from good touristic fun. Climate change and ensuing environmental disasters – marked by an increasing frequency and intensity of destructive floods, droughts, storms, wildfires and extreme temperatures – are now fueling what experts say are just the first waves of places abandoned due to climate displacement. “We are going to see a movement – it’s already happening – where people are moving away from these areas that are most impacted by storms, by rising sea levels and floods, but also by constant fire, smoke inhalation – all of that,” says Gaia Vince, author of “Nomad Century: How Climate Migration Will Reshape Our World.” She cites recent examples like wildfires in Hawaii, California and Australia, and floods in Bangladesh, as some of the latest triggers for population displacements. “How many people are going to return to Lahaina in Hawaii after the fires there?” she questions. “I don’t think it’ll be 100% of the population that left. Some people will not be able to.” Abandoning a settlement is typically a last-resort scenario, made only once residents have exhausted all other options, say experts. In some instances, resettlements have been aided or forced in “managed retreats” or “planned relocations,” in which financial and logistical support is provided by government agencies. Jack DeWaard, scientific director at international nongovernmental organization the Population Council, and an expert on climate and environmental migration and displacement, notes that this involves government entities “working collectively with communities to relocate them entirely.” For the displaced, “the costs of migration, economically and psychologically, are substantial,” he says. “They’re forced to leave their traditions, their network of family and friends, their ancestors’ graves, their language, all of that, because it’s become unlivable. That is very traumatic, it’s very difficult,” adds Vince. More than 20 million people are forced to leave their homes due to extreme weather events each year, according to the United Nations. Researchers have projected that by the end of the century, somewhere in the range of 3 to 6 billion people will be “left outside the ‘human climate niche’” that best supports life. “It doesn’t mean that 3 to 6 billion people will have to move, but it does mean a lot of people have to move,” Vince notes. This, she says, will disproportionality affect communities of color and/or those who are already facing poverty. “Typically, migration and displacement, these are processes that are rooted in inequality,” explains DeWaard, who adds that the climate crisis is only “going to exacerbate the existing inequalities of today.” Through the lens of tourism, many areas that have been historically reliant on tourism economies will also be vulnerable to abandonment says Vince. She cites examples like Alpine ski resorts, where snowfall is no longer conducive to skiing, or traditional holiday spots like Spain and the Mediterranean that have been experiencing deadly heatwaves and wildfires. “Tourists are going to choose other places,” she says. “They don’t want to sit in a heatwave, with having to be evacuated because of forest fires.” But there is also a niche segment of so-called “dark tourism” that could arise around such climate change-born ghost towns. “There is an inherent fascination with ruination, where ruins of the past often tell a story of our misdeeds and misfortunes,” explains Philip Stone of the University of Central Lancashire, where he runs the Institute for Dark Tourism Research. “Climate change will undoubtedly cause death of landscapes where we shall mourn our environmental decline.” While the pursuit of dark tourism, which the Institute defines as “tourist sites of death, disaster, or the seemingly macabre,” can raise ethical questions, Stone ventures to say that such touristic curiosity can actually be beneficial. “The visual impact of climate change-induced landscapes serves as a warning of our industrialization,” he says. “Visiting such places now can shine a critical light on the effects of climate change and, in so doing, offer educational experiences to the contemporary visitor.” Here are five global ghost towns that have been created as climate change reshapes the world – the likely harbingers of many more to come. (Note that in some of these destinations, some holdout townsfolk still remain.) The South Pacific island nation of Fiji is particularly vulnerable to the climate change effects of rising sea levels and intensifying cyclones. Dozens of coastal communities in Fiji have been earmarked for planned relocations to higher ground by the Fijian government, as their underwater fates loom ever nearer. The small seaside village of Vunidogoloa, on Vanua Levu, the country’s second-biggest island, was the first of the bunch to be relocated, to a lush inland hillside, in 2014. Today, remnants of the original dilapidated village, now overrun with vegetation, are all that remain on the old site where some 150 people once lived. Communities along coastal Louisiana have been particularly devastated by climate change’s sea level rise, coastal erosion and battering storms and hurricanes. Isle de Jean Charles, an island in the Gulf of Mexico about 80 miles (129 kilometers) south of New Orleans, once spanned 22,000 acres. But today, only 320 acres of the sinking island remain. The local community, where residents claimed Native American ancestry, was awarded a government grant, affording them funding to develop a newly established settlement dubbed “The New Isle,” set about 40 miles north of the island, on higher ground. As of October 2023, all but four of Isle de Jean Charles’s original families have relocated there. Among the most climate change-vulnerable countries in Europe, Moldova faces ongoing climate risks like heatwaves, storms, droughts, and, most especially, floods, having recorded three major flooding events in the last 20 years. The impacts of such flooding in the heavily agricultural nation have led to widespread destruction and expense, with some villages deemed damaged beyond repair. One such settlement was Cotul Morii, a village on the banks of the Prut River that was submerged by catastrophic flooding in 2010. Rather than rebuild, the government mandated that a new Cotul Morii village be reconstructed about nine miles away. Once the world’s highest ski resort, the 17,388-foot-high lodge on Mount Chacaltaya opened in the 1930s as a popular – and only – ski resort in Bolivia’s Andes. For decades, the mountaintop resort, just north of La Paz, welcomed skiers and sledders in the winter months to crisscross its snowy pistes, until shuttering in 2009. That was the same year the mountain’s 18,000-year-old Chacaltaya glacier completely melted away due to climate change – with much of the snow disappearing along with it. Today, the one-time resort, with its abandoned café, bar, and ski lifts, stands in testimony to what was. Climate change has been linked to more volatile cycles of droughts and flooding along the Mississippi River, North America’s longest river. When the Mississippi’s Great Flood of 1993 inundated the small Illinois town of Valmeyer, damaging the majority of its buildings, town residents – with government funding to back them – decided to reconstruct the 900-person town on a neighboring bluff. While the flood event itself perhaps predates climate change, 30 years later, the new town of Valmeyer is considered to be a textbook case for how town relocations for climate resilience might be successfully conducted today. Today, the new Valmeyer is thriving; the old town, set within a natural floodplain, is primarily used for farming and recreation."

","Lilit Marcus, CNN","It’s the final week of 2023, and here’s the travel news: An island resort is eradicating mosquitoes, a bridge in Vietnam was designed for aesthetics instead of transportation, and people around the world are about to enjoy New Year’s traditions. As we look ahead to 2024, it’s a great time to plan for the year to come. Eating marzipan piglets. Wearing red underwear. Buying a new suitcase. No matter where you are in the world, every culture has its own special way of ringing in the new year and bringing in good luck for the months to come. Many of these international traditions involve eating a special food or meal, like soba noodles in Japan or grapes in Spain. And when it comes to making 2024 travel plans, it’s not just about where to go – it’s about how. In the year ahead, there are lots of ways to be a more responsible traveler as you explore the world. You can rely on train and bus travel when possible, or seek out an airline that uses alternative fuels. You can stay at hotels that have environmental certification and incorporate sustainable elements. And thanks to Dubai airline Emirates, you can buy high-end luggage made out of recycled airplane parts. And while you’re making resolutions, our roundups of the most unfortunate airplane incidents and the worst-behaved tourists of 2023 offer plenty of hints about what not to do. One upscale island resort is resolving that its visitors won’t spend their trip scratching away at mosquito bites. Rather than relying on eradication programs that use chemicals, the Soneva Fushi resort in the Maldives is experimenting with special traps that attract the bugs by smelling like people. Even better? The reduction in mosquitoes is helping native plants and flowers to thrive. Whether your 2024 travel plans involve a Maldivian island or not, our partners at CNN Underscored, a product reviews and recommendations guide owned by CNN, have rated and reviewed the best bug repellents on the market. All over the Northern Hemisphere, the chill of winter has set in. One way to get warmer is to visualize being in a hot, steamy place – like a Turkish hamam, for example. The famous Zeyrek Çinili Hamam, which has been serving Istanbul for nearly 500 years, recently reopened to the public. It is currently a museum and is set to restart operations as a hamam with separate men’s and women’s sections in March 2024. Visitors can experience three different levels: a cold room, a dry seating area and the 50C (122F) steam-filled hararet, whose centerpiece is the “belly stone.” In the museum, an augmented reality display showcases the hamam’s original dazzling tiled appearance. As writer Alice Barnes-Brown put it, Zeyrek Çinili Hamam is “set to be the only place in the city where you can learn something new, have an AR experience, drink a cup of coffee, get undressed in public – and still feel relaxed when you come out.” Why would someone build a bridge that doesn’t meet in the middle? The answer has to do with romance. You can only get to this shop by via ferrata. It has been dubbed the world’s “least convenient convenience store.” Post-divorce, she moved from Texas to Italy. “My money goes a lot further here,” Barbara Barto said. Less than 1% of domestic flights were cancelled during the holiday season. See how that compares to the festive period in 2022."
https://www.cnn.com/travel/snow-farming-climate/index.html,The ski resorts stockpiling snow to resist global warming,01/11/2024,"                                                 Snow is the white gold that keeps ski resorts alive, but as the climate crisis makes it increasingly scarce, some are hoarding it year-round to ensure they can open.                                             ","Rob Hodgetts, CNN","It’s the white gold that gives ski resorts their essence, but these days, snow is an increasingly precious commodity. Whether it’s falling from the sky in silent, fluffy flakes or being pumped out of the now ubiquitous snow cannons lining the ski runs, resorts rely on the white stuff to maintain a viable business. But with climate change affecting snow reliability in the mountains, particularly in lower altitude resorts, more and more venues are employing a third method to supplement coverage and attract enough visitors to open the lifts at the start of the season. Snow farming is the practice of stockpiling snow from the end of one season, collecting and storing it under a vast tent of insulated mats, then spreading it out again next winter – like rolling up the red carpet after the Oscars ready for next year, then spreading it out again the following winter. One place this seemingly straightforward approach is being pioneered is the resort of Levi in the far north of Finland. There, they ensure the resort can open in early October, and virtually guarantee the early-season World Cup ski races can go ahead in November, by using farmed snow to lay down a base layer on certain runs without needing to rely on nature’s bounty. Nor do they have to operate the snow cannons – which force out water and compressed air to fall as snow crystals – in less-than optimal conditions, leading to huge savings in electricity and water. “Of course, snow is the most critical element in this skiing business, it’s our gold so we save the gold by storing it and using the snow to help start the season,” said Marko Mustonen, commercial director of Levi. “Sometimes it’s tough, the seasons aren’t always excellent and snow in winter arrives at different times. “When winter starts, one day it is -5 C (-23 F), one day it is raining, but we don’t need to worry about these types of conditions because we have a nice, certain layer of snow already. “We can then use the automatic [snow cannon] systems to make skiing as good as possible after that. If we make snow in -10C rather than -1C or zero C it is almost 10 times better efficiency.” In Levi, there are nine strategically placed storage areas for the stockpiled snow, which this year amounted to 200,000 cubic meters. All the snow mounds are covered with 70 milimeter (2.8-inch) -thick insulated mats, made of Finnfoam used in the construction industry, and topped with a waterproof sheet. “At the moment under our mats in the north part of Finland, the melting rate is under 13%, which is pretty good,” said Kalle Palander, a retired Finnish ski racing champion and sales director for Snow Secure, the company behind the insulation. “And every year we learn more.” What began on a small scale in 2016 to combat repeated cancellations of the World Cup slalom races on the Levi Black slope has grown into a wider operation to prepare a number of ski runs for visitors, including the new showpiece Levi Glacier run, as well as cross-country tracks, some of which can be preserved under a layer of sawdust or woodchips. “It’s important, economically, for the ski resort,” adds Mustonen. “It means when we get the first lift opened, we get people here and we are alive.” Snow farming is just a small part of Levi’s overall snow production and management, but it has contributed to the resort’s commitment to reducing its carbon emissions, on the way to becoming net zero carbon “by 2050 or as soon as possible.” Levi, which has used renewable electricity since 2020, has also switched its fleet of snow grooming machines to biofuel for the 2023-24 season, making the snow farming even a greener alternative to fossil fuels. Machine-made snow has been a long-time ingredient in producing top-level ski racing tracks, and skiing on farmed snow from last year is equally as good as the fresh stuff, says Mustonen. “You wouldn’t find any difference on it, and it’s maybe even holding better, it’s very good for skiing,” he said. Even back in 2014, organizers of the Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia were storing about 800,000 cubic metres of snow to supplement the natural and man-made supplies to ensure the alpine events could go ahead, mindful of the unpredictable conditions at the Rosa Khutor venue and the lack of snow at Vancouver 2010. A similar process was repeated at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. In Cervinia in Italy this summer, five great mounds covered in white matting stored snow to lay down a base for the new World Cup downhill ski run, starting high up on the Theodul Glacier above Zermatt in Switzerland before swooping across the border and plunging down to a finish line on the Italian side, overseen by the imposing pyramid of the Matterhorn. Austria’s Kitzbuhel, home of the infamous Hahnenkamm downhill ski race, has been snow farming since 2015 and uses it to prepare piste No. 71 (Resterkogel) for early-season skiing. The snow depot is sited directly on the sheltered piste to limit transportation and contains about 30,000 cubic metres of snow, stored under insulated covers. In Davos in Switzerland, snow farming is used to create a four-kilometer (2.5-mile) cross-country ski trail that is open by the end of October. About 20,000 cubic meters of machine-made snow – which is harder and more compact than natural snow and so better for conserving – is created the previous December or January when the weather is at its coldest and is covered in wood chippings and then spread out in the fall, with about 80% remaining. The track is open to professionals and amateurs alike with bookable time slots. “It’s very popular for professional cross-country skiers, and we get skiers from maybe 12 nations coming here for early training,” said Samuel Rosenast, head of communications for Davos. In North America, resorts including Banff Sunshine in Canada and Arapahoe Basin in Colorado trap wind-blown snow with a network of fences for redistribution to other parts of the ski area but they are still using that year’s supply which melts back into the watershed in summer. Another Swiss resort, Laax, uses snow farming to protect its endangered Vorab Glacier, which experts predict could disappear in the next 30-35 years if manmade global warming continues at the same rate. Snow is redistributed onto the glacier in May and covered in insulation until September to slow down the melting of the ice and to preserve the foundations of the drag lift which serves the ski runs. “Covering parts of the glacier and pushing a lot of snow together in spring allows us to open the glacier for winter sports a little earlier in autumn, as we don’t need the same amount of new snow coming from the sky,” said a spokesperson for Laax. In southeast Switzerland, glaciologists Felix Keller and Johannes Oerlemans found through a 2017 pilot study and subsequent computer modeling that covering part of the fast-retreating Morteratsch Glacier with machine-made snow could slow down its rate of melting and could even lead to growth of the glacier in 10 years in the right conditions. The idea is that a lattice of sprinklers employing similar technology to snow cannons is placed over one square kilometer of the most melt-prone ice and constantly sprayed with sustainably produced artificial snow. The project, known as MortAlive, was launched in February 2021 and is in the fund-raising and development stage, but critics say it is a sticking-plaster solution when the real fix is to halt human-induced climate change."

The way we prepare for them should, too.",09-24-2024,"                                                 Hurricane preparedness, and the way people perceive storms, needs to change as hurricanes get stronger, wetter and intensify faster.                                             ","Rachel Ramirez, CNN","Hurricanes aren’t what they used to be. As the planet warms, they are morphing into something more dangerous — intensifying faster, producing more rainfall and generating bigger storm surge. To protect ourselves from these increasing threats, researchers say hurricane preparedness and the way people perceive storms need to proactively change, as well. “We want to make sure that people are not being complacent, (know) that these storms are intensifying more because of climate change, and that they are taking that seriously,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, director of public affairs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told CNN. More than 90% of global warming over the past 50 years has taken place in the oceans. Hurricanes are taking full advantage of the additional energy, getting stronger faster – and sometimes right before landfall. Rapid intensification is giving people little to no time to evacuate; officials and coastal residents who may have been expecting a Category 1 hurricane when they went to bed might wake up to a Category 3. Several hurricanes in the past few years, including Hurricane Ian, which devastated the southwest Florida coastline. Emergency managers may not order evacuations because hurricanes are rapidly intensifying after the evacuation window has closed, said Samantha Montano, a disaster researcher at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. More often now, coastal residents will find themselves sheltering at home. “We’ve not necessarily put the resources and time into figuring out the most effective way of priming the public to understand what sheltering in place for a potentially major hurricane actually looks like,” Montano told CNN. That means having enough food and water for an extended period in the event of power outages. It may also mean having a backup generator as well as a solar charger for your phone if you can afford it, Montano added. Temperatures soared in Texas after Hurricane Beryl made landfall this summer. The heat index shot to more than 100 degrees while roughly 2.2 million customers didn’t have power, and importantly, air conditioning. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed with people suffering from heat illness. Rethinking preparedness plans that consider other extreme disasters require “different layers of decision- making,” said Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at Columbia University’s Climate School. Prepare as if you’ll get stuck in one place longer than anticipated, Kruczkiewicz said. Stock up on non-perishable food and make sure it’s stored in a place that isn’t at risk of flooding. Make sure you have extra essentials, too, and a first-aid kit. “This expectation that we’ve kind of historically had in the US that it’ll be no more than 72 hours until help comes is not necessarily the case anymore,” Montano said. “So, people need to make sure that they have, to the best of their ability, as many supplies as possible.” Finally, know where officials are setting up shelters in your community. These shelters could provide necessities to survive, including air conditioning, food and a safe place to sleep. Hurricane categories are based on the storm’s wind speed and don’t say anything about its storm surge or flood risk. “The type of impact that we’re seeing, even if we talk about a Category 1, is different now,” Kruczkiewicz said, noting that Category 1 storms now carry intense rainfall and can also generate widespread storm surge. Individuals need to dismantle their “perception and pride, thinking we could handle it” when the storm is a low category, he added. “The actions (we can take) may still be appropriate, but they may have to be enhanced in different ways,” Kruczkiewicz said. With many different sources of news and information, “decentralizing and democratizing information is important,” Njoki Mwarumba, assistant professor of emergency management at SUNY Empire State University, “but it has to be reliable.” In doing so, Kruczkiewicz said go beyond and ask yourself the following questions: “Why am I using this data source? Maybe I use my iPhone app for day-to-day weather but is that really the best app when I’m making life- or- death decisions for my family on how to prepare?” Experts say it is imperative for people to listen to local emergency managers, and monitor weather forecast and information coming from the National Hurricane Center or National Weather Service. “Know your source,” Kruczkiewicz said. “And take that source very seriously.”"

",Reuters,"Countries have moved a step closer to getting a fund off the ground to help poor states damaged by climate disasters, despite reservations from developing nations and the United States. The deal to create a “loss and damage” fund was hailed as a breakthrough for developing country negotiators at United Nations climate talks in Egypt last year, overcoming years of resistance from wealthy nations. But in the past 11 months, governments have struggled to reach consensus on the details of the fund, such as who will pay and where the fund will be located. A special UN committee tasked with implementing the fund met for a fifth time in Abu Dhabi this week — following a deadlock in Egypt last month — to finalize recommendations that will be put to governments when they meet for the annual climate summit COP28 in Dubai in less than four weeks’ time. The goal is to get the fund up and running by 2024. The committee, representing a geographically diverse group of countries, on Saturday resolved to recommend the World Bank serve as trustee and host of the fund — a tension point that has fueled divisions between developed and developing nations. Housing a fund at the World Bank, whose presidents are appointed by the US, would give donor countries outsized influence over the fund and result in high fees for recipient countries, developing countries have argued. To get all countries on board, it was agreed the World Bank would serve as interim trustee and host of the fund for a four-year period. Jennifer Morgan, Germany’s special climate envoy, said in a post on X that Berlin “stands ready to fulfill its responsibility — we’re actively working towards contributing to the new fund and assessing options for more structural sources of financing.” Others were less optimistic. “It is a somber day for climate justice, as rich countries turn their backs on vulnerable communities,” said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International. “Rich countries … have not only coerced developing nations into accepting the World Bank as the host of the Loss and Damage Fund but have also evaded their duty to lead in providing financial assistance to those communities and countries.” The committee also recommended that developed countries be urged to continue to provide support to the fund, but failed to resolve whether wealthy nations would be under strict financial obligation to chip in. “We regret that the text does not reflect consensus concerning the need for clarity on the voluntary nature of contributions,” a US State Department official told Reuters. The US attempted to include a footnote clarifying that any contributions to the fund would be voluntary, but the committee chair did not allow it. The US objected to that denial. Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, who will preside over the COP28 talks, said he welcomed the committee’s recommendations and that they would pave the way for an agreement at COP28."

In a series of graphics, we take a look at some of the biggest environmental challenges ...","Words by Flo Cornall, graphics by Woojin Lee, CNN","Blazing fires, biblical floods and catastrophic storms are becoming increasingly common but they could be just a taste of things to come. Scientists say our planet is teetering towards a number of climate “tipping points” which could cause irreversible changes to the place we all call home. From the Antarctic ice sheet to the Amazon rainforest, the consequences of climate change can be seen right now – but it’s not the only threat to the natural world. In a series of graphics, we take a look at some of the biggest environmental challenges facing our planet. Human activities including logging, pollution, overfishing and urban development are driving a staggering loss of biodiversity. Global wildlife populations plummeted by 69% on average between 1970 and 2018, according to WWF’s Living Planet Report 2022. It notes that land-use change – which includes clearing land for agriculture or urban development – is the biggest current threat to nature, but adds that climate change is “likely to become the dominant cause of biodiversity loss in the coming decades.” The UN’s landmark 2019 biodiversity report said that one million of all the planet’s eight million species are threatened with extinction. It reported that the global rate of extinction “is already tens to hundreds of times higher than it has been, on average, over the last 10 million years.” Trees soak up planet-heating carbon dioxide and forests can lock away carbon for centuries, but they’re disappearing at an alarming rate due to a combination of human activities. Southeast Asia’s peat swamp forests are home to varied wildlife and hold large below-ground carbon stocks but many of these forests have been drained and degraded to make room for farmland. Drained peatland can dry up and turn into a tinderbox, and if it catches fire, it can release up to 10 times more carbon than forest fires. Elsewhere, researchers have found that some tropical forests – including the southeastern part of the Amazon rainforest – are shifting from a carbon sink to a carbon source, adding more carbon into the atmosphere. It can take anywhere from 20 to 500 years for plastics to decompose and they can be found pretty much anywhere, from city streets to Antarctic sea ice and even drinking water. Not even the planet’s tallest peak or the world’s deepest ocean trench can escape plastic pollution. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a 620,000-square-mile swirl of trash, floats on the ocean surface between California and Hawaii, threatening aquatic life with entanglement and chemical contamination. Plastics pose a significant threat to wildlife from seals to seabirds, and have been found in the guts of many aquatic organisms, including every marine turtle species. Microplastics, plastics that have been broken down into tiny pieces, can be found in our drinking water systems and even floating in the air. Pollinators include bumblebees, wasps, moths and butterflies, as well as birds and small mammals, like bats. But many are facing threats from pesticides and crop monocultures, as well as the destruction of their habitats. A 2023 study from the University of Sheffield found that night-time moths account for a third of pollinator visits to crops, flowers and trees in all urban areas, but their global abundance has declined by 33% in the last 50 years. If pollinators continue to decline in numbers, this could have serious repercussions for food production. One study estimated that the loss of pollinators globally is causing a decline in the supply of healthy foods that’s resulting in about 430,000 early deaths a year. Global bird populations face pressure from habitat destruction due to agriculture, development and logging, while seabirds are being impacted by overfishing. In 50 years, nearly 3 billion birds have disappeared from North America’s skies and the UK has 73 million fewer birds than it had in 1970, according to research from the British Trust for Ornithology. In Hawaii, 33 bird species have gone extinct since 1825 due to habitat loss and the introduction of mammals and disease, while in India, 178 species of wild bird are of high conservation priority. Despite the scale of the challenges, there are countless groups and individuals committed to protecting our planet.

","Nadia Leigh-Hewitson, video by Kriti Gandhi, CNN","In 2023, it isn’t hard to imagine we’re living through the end times, with apocalyptic weather events happening throughout the year and across the globe. Since the turn of the millennium, there has been a “staggering rise in climate-related disasters,” according to the UN. Between 2000 and 2019, 3.9 billion people were affected by 6,681 climate-related disasters, compared with 3.2 billion affected by 3,656 such events between 1980 and 1999. By chasing down storms, one woman is throwing herself in the path of some of the most destructive wild forces on planet Earth, recording images that could help us understand and predict extreme weather events. Ad Feedback Though she is an accountant by trade, Sarah Hasan Al-Sayegh calls herself the first Kuwaiti-Arab female storm chaser. When she isn’t crunching numbers, Al-Sayegh tracks ferocious storms, to both photograph nature’s wild beauty and document our changing weather systems. Before she began storm-chasing, Al-Sayegh, 40, photographed landscapes and cityscapes as a hobby. Her enthusiasm for meteorological phenomena was ignited by chance. In 2011, she went out to shoot a landscape. “All of a sudden, this huge Haboob dust storm [was] coming towards me, and I was fascinated with it,” recalls Al-Sayegh. “Haboob is an Arabic term … a wall of cloud that forms when there is a low-level jet coming from the north and it will lift the dust,” she explains. “I was like, how did that happen? How is that possible? And I was hooked from that moment.” Since then, Al-Sayegh has been photographing the storms that sweep across Kuwait and the Arabian Peninsula. “I want to know how storms are happening, how tornadoes are happening,” she says. Even with no meteorological background, Al-Sayegh has noticed changes in the weather patterns in the Middle East. “Storm chasing made me see the world more,” she says. “It helped me to realize that climate change is something real, it’s a serious thing.” There have been a number of extreme weather events in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years. In March and April 2019, parts of Iran, Iraq and Syria were devastated by heavy floods. Last year, sandstorms hit the region from Dubai to Syria, with Iraq hit particularly hard. Sandstorms are happening with unprecedented frequency, experts say, driven partly by climate change. And this month, nearly 4,000 people were killed by flooding in Libya, according to UN figures, the result of extreme rainfall brought by Storm Daniel. “In the past five or six years, [there have been] tornadoes in Saudi Arabia, in the United Arab Emirates, in Qatar and also in Kuwait,” says Al-Sayegh. She says storm chasers can help inform meteorology, but adds that they aren’t taken seriously in the Middle East. For her part, Al-Sayegh collects her photographs and video footage and compares it with the prediction data she puts together for each chase. She then posts the information on social media and shares it with accounts that monitor international weather phenomena. Storm chasing requires planning, patience, and complicated data-analysis. Mistakes can mean missing out on the action or even putting yourself in danger. Al-Sayegh says that the unpredictable forces of nature are not to be taken lightly. “I have to have an exit plan,” she says. Al-Sayegh recalls that on May 31, 2016, she and fellow storm chaser Mike Olbinski came across a huge storm structure near Lamesa, Texas. “We were taking images and suddenly heard a roaring thunder and felt some electricity,” she says. “After looking at Mike’s video footage of the chase day we realized that the lightning struck just feet away from us.” Al-Sayegh acknowledges that storm chasing is predominantly a male-dominated activity, particularly in the Gulf region, and is hopeful that more Arab women will take it up following her example. “I would like to say to all the girls who want to be storm chasers or go into male-dominated jobs: just go for it,” says Al-Sayegh. “Don’t let people say that you cannot do it because you’re a female.” Al-Sayegh is yet to see the chaser’s holy grail - a tornado - first-hand on the Arabian Peninsula. But she has captured images of some astonishing cloud formations, such as a huge “supercell” or “rotating thunderstorm” that resembles a flying saucer. She now hopes to expand her meteorological knowledge and raise awareness around climate change. “I just hope to be able to put that message to everybody through my photography and through my storm chasing,” Al-Sayegh says."
