Experts share risk factors and safety tips.","Many regions across the United States experienced ""record-breaking high temperatures"" in 2023 due to extreme heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Emergency room visits due to heat-related illness peaked in several regions in the U.S. and remained elevated for a prolonged duration compared to visits between 2018 and 2022, the agency’s recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report noted. More males went to the emergency room for heat-related illnesses than females – especially those between 18 and 64 years old. HEART ATTACK DEATH RISK CAN DOUBLE DURING HEAT WAVES AND HIGH POLLUTION, STUDY FINDS: ‘A PERFECT STORM’ Americans are experiencing ""longer, hotter and more frequent episodes of extreme heat,"" the report states. ""Extreme heat could be considered an invisible killer in so much as many people become exposed and vulnerable to its dangers quickly and often without warning,"" Patrick McHugh, M.D., an emergency medicine physician at Cleveland Clinic Akron General in Akron, Ohio, told Fox News Digital. Although McHugh said Americans ""shouldn’t worry,"" he emphasized the need to ""be aware and prepared for the dangers of heat waves."" An EPA spokesperson told Fox News Digital, ""As average temperatures rise due to climate change, the risk of extreme temperatures, heat waves and record-breaking temperatures increases."" SUMMER MELTDOWNS: HERE'S HOW EXTREME HEAT CAN AFFECT YOUR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH Here’s what to know about extreme heat and how to stay safe. ""Extreme heat can be defined depending on a variety of factors, including location, weather conditions (such as cloud cover, humidity and temperature), and the time of year,"" said an EPA spokesperson in an email. It typically occurs when the weather is much hotter and/or more humid than average in a particular area, the agency added. While summertime temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit might be normal for Phoenix, Arizona, for example — the same temperatures are considered extreme for Boston, Massachusetts. ""Where in the U.S. people are most susceptible to heat depends on what is normal for a given location and the type of infrastructure (such as access to air conditioning),"" the EPA spokesperson noted. ""Extreme heat is becoming more common in places that have not historically experienced extreme heat … and don’t have the infrastructure to keep people cool, which has major consequences for health and safety."" A heat wave is typically defined as a ""prolonged period of abnormally hot weather, usually lasting more than two days in a row,"" the EPA spokesperson said. Heat waves can occur with or without humidity. The average global temperature has risen by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the mid-1800s, according to McHugh. ""This results in greater extreme heat temperatures, increased variability in temperatures and an increase in the risk of heat illness,"" he told Fox News Digital. The EPA’s Heat Waves indicator, which monitors trends in heat waves for 50 cities across the U.S. over the past 60 years, shows that heat waves are occurring more often over a longer period of time — both in average number of days and season length — and are also becoming hotter over time. Elderly adults, infants, individuals taking certain medications and people with disabilities are at greater risk of heat-related illnesses, according to McHugh, who has a specialty in wilderness medicine. These individuals may not have adequate resources to escape the heat and protect themselves, he warned. ""Many schools in northern parts of the U.S. do not have air conditioning, so when heat waves happen in May/June or [in] September, students and teachers can be at risk,"" the EPA spokesperson noted. Certain factors can also increase someone’s risk of developing a heat-related illness, including fever, dehydration, prescription drug use, alcohol use or sunburn, according to the CDC. NEW YEAR'S EVE BEVERAGE COULD GO EXTINCT DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, AI COMPANY PREDICTS Healthy people can be at risk if they engage in strenuous physical activity when it’s very hot outside — which means it’s important to balance activities with actions that cool the body to prevent heat-related illness, the EPA advised. Certain settings — such as inside cars, construction worksites and homes with little to no air conditioning — can also put people at greater risk, according to the CDC. Some urban areas experience higher temperatures compared to outlying areas. ""Structures such as buildings, roads and other infrastructure absorb and re-emit the sun’s heat more than natural landscapes like forests and water bodies,"" the EPA spokesperson said. These highly concentrated areas, which have limited greenery, become ""islands"" of higher temperatures relative to outlying areas. ""Daytime temperatures in urban areas are about 1 to 7 [degrees Fahrenheit] higher than temperatures in outlying areas, and nighttime temperatures are about 2-5 [degrees Fahrenheit] higher,"" the agency noted. People living and working in these areas are at higher risk of heat-related illness and death. As people lose control of their internal temperature amid extreme heat, they may experience a range of illnesses, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and hyperthermia, according to the EPA. ""Prolonged exposure to high temperatures is associated with increased hospital admissions for cardiovascular, kidney and respiratory disorders,"" the spokesperson said. Some 1,220 people die of heat-related illness every year in the United States due to extreme heat, per CDC estimates. ""Heat islands also increase energy demand for cooling, which can increase greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and can be a financial burden for many people — particularly low- or fixed-income households,"" the EPA spokesperson said. HOT SUMMER SAFETY: HOW TO KEEP YOUR PETS HEALTHY IN EXTREME TEMPERATURES THIS SEASON Everyone should have a plan in case of extreme heat, McHugh advised. ""Either an air-conditioned home or building where shelter from the heat is easily available should be used."" Those who counter climate change claims warn of extreme temperatures at both ends of the spectrum. Most studies have shown that extreme cold causes about 10 times more excess deaths than extreme heat, according to William Happer, PhD, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University in New Jersey and a prominent critic of climate extremism. A 2015 international study that analyzed deaths between 1985 and 2012 in 13 countries, including the U.S., found that most of the deaths due to adverse temperatures were attributable to cold weather. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER A more recent study published in The Lancet Planetary Health in 2021 found that for every death associated with heat, nine were connected to cold. He estimates that less than half of the warming is from increasing greenhouse gases.   ""Whatever the cause, observations clearly show that there has been very little change in daily high temperatures,"" Happer noted. ""The warming is almost all due to warmer minimum temperatures at night and in the winter."" The study, which was published in The Lancet, also revealed that most deaths were caused not by extreme temperatures, but by exposure to moderately hot and cold temperatures.  ""No one knows how much of the modest recent warming, around 1 [degree Celsius] over the past century, has been due to greenhouse gases and how much is natural,"" Happer told Fox News Digital. For local heat and health information, the EPA spokesperson recommended using the CDC’s Heat and Health Tracker.  Americans can also visit their local National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Offices for real-time heat-related warnings. Fox Weather can also be consulted on a regular basis for up-to-date weather information and news.  For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health. Compared to lives lost due to the extreme heat, the warming should have saved more lives that would have been lost because of the extreme cold, he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"
https://www.foxnews.com/health/rare-tick-borne-babesiosis-disease-on-the-rise-in-northeastern-us-says-cdc-heres-why,"Rare tick-borne babesiosis disease on the rise in northeastern US, says CDC: Here's why",03-17-2023,"The CDC reported that cases of babesiosis, a parasitic disease spread by infected ticks, saw a significant uptick between 2011 and 2019 in some northeastern states.","Lyme disease may hold the distinction of being the most commonly reported tick-borne disease in the U.S. — but it’s not the only one.  Babesiosis, a rare tick-borne parasitic disease, is spiking in some states. The CDC reported on Friday that cases of babesiosis saw a significant uptick between 2011 and 2019 in some northeastern states.  In that time frame, a total of 16,456 cases were reported in 37 states. Eight U.S. states saw notable increases.  TICK BITES ON THE RISE: HOW TO STAY SAFE AS YOU HEAD OUTDOORS The biggest jumps were seen in Vermont (1,602%, from two to 34 cases), Maine (1,422%, from nine to 138 cases), New Hampshire (372%, from 13 to 78 cases) and Connecticut (338%, from 74 to 328).  Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont also saw increases. Babesiosis is a disease that occurs when a microscopic parasite, babesia, infects red blood cells.  MarkAlain Déry, DO, MPH, infectious disease doctor and chief innovation officer at Access Health Louisiana, was not surprised to hear of the increase in the tick-borne disease. In an interview with Fox News Digital, he said this has been an ongoing discussion in the infectious disease community for over a decade. ""As we’ve seen more effects of climate change, we expected that we would probably start to see different pathogens begin to expand the reach of their ecological niche,"" Dr. Déry said.  'SILENT PANDEMIC' WARNING FROM WHO: BACTERIA KILLING TOO MANY PEOPLE DUE TO ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE ""Not only did we see an increase of cases in states where it was already endemic, but we also saw new endemic states, mostly in the New England area."" Babesiosis is most prevalent in warm, wet areas, he added. ""I wouldn’t be surprised to see other viral illnesses increase as well, like chikungunya, dengue or yellow fever, or parasitic infections like malaria,"" said Déry.  ""As the climate gets warmer, it’s more likely that pathogens we wouldn’t normally see in the U.S. would expand into the country."" ""Even one degree of a difference in temperature is enough for pathogens to expand their reach,"" he added. Transmitted by black-legged ticks or deer ticks, babesiosis is most prevalent in some northeast and upper Midwest states, primarily during the warmer seasons, per the CDC’s website. Lyme disease is transmitted by the same kind of ticks, but it is a bacterium and not a parasite.  ""In areas where Lyme is prevalent, you’re likely to also see babesiosis,"" said Dr. Déry. The two diseases share some common symptoms.  Lyme, however, causes a distinctive ""bulls-eye"" rash, which doesn’t happen with babesiosis. (Not everyone with Lyme disease will have the rash, according to medical experts.) Some of the most common symptoms of babesiosis mimic those of the cold and flu, which can mean many cases are going undiagnosed.  People who are infected may experience fever, chills, sweats, fatigue, headache, cough, muscle aches and sore throat. In more extreme cases, Dr. Déry said patients may have an enlarged liver and spleen, jaundice or visual changes. Very rarely, higher-risk patients may suffer from respiratory distress, heart failure, kidney failure or multi-organ failure. The highest-risk patients are those who have had splenectomies, a surgical procedure to remove a damaged or diseased spleen. ""When the babesia parasite gets into the system, it goes through multiple cycles inside the body,"" Dr. Déry explained.  AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE SPIKE BLAMED ON WESTERN DIET, SCIENTISTS SAY ""One of the final cycles is getting through the spleen, which helps to attack the parasite that’s living inside the red blood cells. People who don’t have spleens don’t have that final pass-through, so they’re at a greater risk for parasitemia, which is when the parasite enters the blood."" Other high-risk groups include those living with HIV, people who are over 55, young children, or people who take immunosuppressants for autoimmune disorders, the doctor said. ""For the vast majority of people, babesiosis will run its course, similar to the flu,"" the doctor said. Everyone who is diagnosed with the disease should seek treatment, said Dr. Déry.  ""Unlike a viral cold or a mild case of COVID, it’s something you should treat,"" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The most common medications are antimicrobials with anti-parasitic properties, such as azithromycin and atovaquone.  With treatment, babesiosis patients usually recover fully within seven to 10 days.  For those living in or traveling to the states where babesiosis is endemic, avoiding wooded areas is the best course of action to prevent infection.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER When spending time outdoors, Dr. Déry recommends wearing long pants, long sleeves, and shoes and socks that cover the ankles.  Use of insect repellent will also help deter infected ticks."

https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/how-ai-machine-learning-revealing-food-waste-commercial-kitchens-restaurants-real-time,How AI and machine learning are revealing food waste in commercial kitchens and restaurants 'in real time',07-13-2023,"Winnow, a food waste solution company, developed an AI-powered system to reduce food waste in commercial kitchens. CEO Marc Zornes and Iberostar's Dr. Morikawa weighed in.","Food waste makes up an estimated 30% to 40% of the food supply, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture — and now a London company is using artificial intelligence in an attempt to address the problem.  Winnow, a food waste solution company, has developed an AI-powered system that aims to reduce food waste in commercial kitchens worldwide. CEO Marc Zornes said the company's tech can measure the foods that get tossed daily using machine learning and a camera. CHATGPT LIFE HACKS: HOW USERS ARE SPAWNING GROCERY LISTS FROM AI-GENERATED RECIPES AND MEAL PLANS ""We use computer vision to identify what's being wasted in real time, literally as the food's being thrown away,"" he told Fox News Digital in an interview.  A scale is placed underneath the system to measure how much food is wasted, Zornes explained. From there, Winnow can help decipher the cost and profile of the discarded food. ""With that data, we give information back to the culinary team and to management showing the total value of food waste, connecting that with the volume of food they serve or purchase to help them make decisions to drive down food waste,"" Zornes said. ""We like to think of it as helping them to purchase, prepare or produce better."" One of Winnow's clients, the international hotel and resort group Iberostar, has implemented the tech into its own kitchens at locations worldwide. Dr. Megan Morikawa, Iberostar Group's global director of sustainability, told Fox News Digital the company’s strategy is to ""bring protection for the oceans across the hospitality business.""  Morikawa, of Washington, D.C., is also a marine biologist — and said Winnow is helping Iberostar achieve its objectives, including reaching carbon neutrality by 2030. The company wants to improve the ecological health of the natural areas surrounding the 100+ Iberostar properties in 16 countries — about 80% of which are beachfront, she noted. For customers at all-inclusive, luxury hospitality locations, the food experience is ""integral to both their cultural and culinary exploration,"" said Morikawa. AI DEFINES ‘IDEAL BODY TYPE' PER SOCIAL MEDIA – HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE But the carbon footprint left behind from food waste, the company found, had more of an environmental impact than all the electricity consumed on its properties. Taking steps to reduce the environmental impact of food waste can benefit the world's oceans, according to Morikawa. ""The oceans are beautiful places for us to work and see, and they're at risk,"" she said. ""And some of the best ways we can help them are through the actions we're taking in our operations."" AI TECH IDENTIFIES SUICIDE RISK IN MILITARY VETERANS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE: ‘FLIPPING THE MODEL’ The ocean's plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and help to absorb the CO2 that drives climate change, said Morikawa. The food system accounts for as much as 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions, Zornes said. Food waste is also the leading cause of water withdrawals and biodiversity loss, as about a third of all food is wasted. ""That happens across the supply chain,"" Zornes said. ""And whether you care about it from a climate perspective or just an inefficiency perspective, it's a problem that we believe can be addressed.""  He added, ""Reducing food waste helps kitchens save on costs and buy less food, which then drives down the environmental impacts on our food system."" It's ""a lot harder"" to measure how food is wasted in industrial kitchens, which is why Winnow has been so beneficial for Iberostar, said Morikawa. Winnow’s machine-learning model considers the time of day, the weight of food items and other characteristics such as color and shape. AI-DISCOVERED DRUG SHOWS ‘ENORMOUS POTENTIAL’ TO TREAT SCHIZOPHRENIA: ‘REAL NEED FOR BETTER TREATMENT’ As an example, Morikawa said Winnow can detect whether a yellow food item thrown into its bin in the morning is scrambled eggs, pineapple or something else. ""With Winnow Vision, we're able to have assisted classification of food, which allows us to much more efficiently see what we're throwing away at the end of a service and hit our targets of reducing food waste,"" she said. Zornes emphasized that ""every single time someone throws food away, we create information that helps AI get smarter."" He said, ""We are able to identify what's new in the bin by looking at what was in it before and after. Then we identify what that product is by taking the image and using it to train our model."" Each time Winnow takes photos in the more than 2,000 kitchens where it’s implemented right now, the information is fed into the computer vision model, which leads to the ""very accurate and very powerful"" identification of food waste, said Zornes. Feedback from Winnow’s clientele has been ""very positive,"" he said.  Iberostar's Morikawa agreed that AI systems like Winnow have become ""key"" to efficiency. The real power of AI, Zornes suggested, is that it ""allows us to do things we previously didn’t imagine were possible,"" including simplifying important tasks like managing food waste. ""We’re excited about the way this technology is progressing,"" he said. ""Through advanced analytics, we see [kitchens] better able to predict what they need to prepare."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We foresee leveraging computer vision in other parts of the kitchen to help understand how they can prepare food, hire and operate more efficiently,"" he also said. Winnow’s ""medium-term"" ambition by the end of the decade is to prevent $1 billion per year from being wasted.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER To date, the company's AI tech has saved $175 million in food waste, according to Zornes. "

Champagne may be in short supply rather soon, according to ClimateAI, a climate resilience platform based in San Francisco. The company said the changing global climate could threaten the popular celebratory beverage. ClimateAI's artificial intelligence-driven data has suggested that hundreds of grape varieties could be on the brink of extinction, including champagne-making grapes like pinot noir, chardonnay and merlot. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? Will Kletter, ClimateAI's vice president of operations and strategy, told Fox News Digital in an interview that champagne and wine drinkers may be at a loss by the year 2050. ""If you are a consumer who has a very particular preference for a bottle of wine from a certain region, then I would encourage you to enjoy that now,"" he said. Champagne’s ""delicious"" taste comes from a cross-over of warm, sunny days for rich flavor and cool nights for an acidic, crisp feeling, Kletter said. MEET THE AMERICAN WHO SAVED THE CHAMPAGNE INDUSTRY: MISSOURI SCIENTIST CHARLES VALENTINE RILEY But as the climate warms, the expert warned that those cool nights could ""start to go away."" ""That puts growers in a very difficult position,"" he said. ""They can decide to harvest early to prevent what's called overripening — too much booze, too much flavor in the grape — or let it sit on the vine and risk that over-ripening, but maybe get that acidity."" ""So fundamentally, there will be a trade-off required to get the flavors we’re expecting."" HEAD OF GOOGLE BARD BELIEVES AI CAN HELP IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND COMPASSION: ‘REALLY REMARKABLE’ In light of a changing climate, Kletter said some growers will be forced to move their production north to capture some colder weather. There has been a ""significant"" uptick in investment in sparkling products produced in the U.K., for example, where there are warm, sunny days with cool nights, he pointed out. As companies start to move to different locations, Kletter predicted the economy will shift as well. Champagne currently comes from one region of France.  French wine accounts for $9.6 billion in exports, equaling 16% of all global wine sales, according to ClimateAI. HOW AI AND MACHINE LEARNING ARE REVEALING FOOD WASTE IN COMMERCIAL KITCHENS AND RESTAURANTS ‘IN REAL TIME’ In 2021, champagne growers saw their smallest harvest since 1957 due to extreme weather events, ClimateAI reported. ""Sparkling wine can be made anywhere, but champagne can only be made in Champagne, [France],"" he said. ""This is critical for the French economy."" Half a million champagne industry employees, as well as 24 million tourists who travel to the region each year, could be impacted by the changing climate, Kletter told Fox News Digital. ""Decades, if not centuries, of tradition and culture are built around champagne in that region,"" he said.  ""They're going to face a lot of challenges with preserving the economy and culture as that ideal zone moves away from them."" 1945 ROMANEE-CONTI: THE MOST EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF WINE EVER SOLD Kletter predicted that a ""very significant economic shift"" will occur as crops change, especially in Italian regions where the production of certain wines is at risk. ""You already see Italy kind of dethroned as the world leader [of wine production] due to a number of factors, but climate is certainly an important one,"" he said. ""So it will represent a rebalancing."" Using AI technology, ClimateAI works with clients to forecast and ensure food crop resiliency for up to 50 years into the future. Its platform, called ClimateLens, combines AI, advanced learning and data points from various sources to come up with climate outlooks and forecasts for specific locations, according to the company's website. ""Our customers can get this data as actionable insights specific to their locations, crops and varieties,"" Kletter said.  That may influence which varieties they cultivate — as well as where and when they plant, he noted. This information could guide customers to make ""more strategic decisions"" about where to grow over the long term, Kletter said. To adapt, Kletter encouraged growers to blend different grapes to create new versions of popular wine selections. For example, in Bordeaux and Burgundy, that might mean using new grapes to make Bordeaux wine. RED WINE HEADACHES COULD BE CAUSED BY THIS INTRIGUING CULPRIT, STUDY FINDS Growers can switch up their timing and use certain methods to protect grapes from the sun, Kletter also mentioned. ""It starts with an understanding of the risk exposure,"" he said. ""And then our customers can move from that longer-term insight to our seasonal offering."" ""Despite being in the business of climate risk … we like to think of ourselves as being optimistic, because we provide tools to folks all over the world who are tackling these challenges head-on."" NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University climate scientist Dr. Benjamin Cook reacted to ClimateAI's claims in an exchange with Fox News Digital. The New York-based scientist reiterated that extinction isn't a credible conclusion, since grapes like chardonnay and pinot noir are grown in many regions. ""It is likely, however, that the climate in the Champagne region will become less suitable for these grapes, which means the champagne produced will be different, and possibly lower quality,"" he said. WINE QUIZ! HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE DELICIOUS DRINK? ""At the same time, it is likely that areas further north will become more suitable for these grapes, opening up the potential for improved production in these other regions."" Cook agreed that climate change will have ""significant impacts"" on viticulture, which will present a ""major challenge to the industry moving forward, especially for high-value wines."" ""This will require some degree of adaptation, which might include changing varietals and the wines produced in different regions, moving production to new areas with more suitable climates, or changing management strategies within regions affected by climate change,"" he said.  Fox News Digital reached out to several champagne and wine producers, including Veuve Cliquot, Moet & Chandon and Dom Perignon, for comment.

Okereke, who works as the director of the Center for Climate Change and Development at Alex Ekwueme Federal University in Nigeria, explained in the essay on Tuesday the concept of solar geoengineering, which is supposed to redirect climate damage from the sun’s rays. Although the concept has been gaining traction in recent years, Okereke criticized efforts by Western countries to persuade Africa to get involved. ""As a climate expert, I consider these environmental manipulation techniques extremely risky. And as an African climate expert, I strongly object to the idea that Africa should be turned into a testing ground for their use. Even if solar geoengineering can help deflect heat and improve weather conditions on the ground — a prospect that is unproven on any relevant scale — it’s not a long-term solution to climate change. It sends a message to the world that we can carry on over-consuming and polluting because we will be able to engineer our way out of the problem,"" Okereke wrote. ADAMS APPLAUDS NYC HOSPITALS FOR FEEDING PATIENTS PLANT-BASED MEALS OVER MEAT BY DEFAULT IN CLIMATE PUSH  Ideas such as reflecting sunlight away from the Earth by injecting aerosols are ""highly speculative,"" Okereke insisted, and could cause more damage to an already poorer nation. He wrote, ""Africa is already suffering the effects of climate change, such as drought, floods and erratic weather. And while geoengineering advocates see these technologies as a solution to such problems, the technologies run the danger of upsetting local and regional weather patterns — intensifying drought or flooding, for example, or disrupting monsoon cycles. And the long-term impact on regional climate and seasons is still largely unknown. Millions, perhaps billions, of people’s livelihoods could be undermined."" Efforts to push these ideas, however, continued to be pushed by organizations funded by Bill Gates. In addition, George Soros has recently called for further investments into potentially altering the climate in the Arctic. ""Sir David King has a plan to repair the climate system. He wants to recreate the albedo effect by creating white clouds high above the earth,"" Soros said. ""With proper scientific safeguards and in consultation with local indigenous communities, this project could help restabilize the Arctic climate system which governs the entire global climate system."" LIBERAL MEDIA MADE SLEW OF DUBIOUS CLAIMS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, YEAR-END REPORT FINDS  Okereke continued to warn that these risky investments would not only ""need to be deployed essentially forever"" to combat ""suppressed warming of the carbon dioxide"" but would also ""divert attention and investments from building renewable energy and other climate solutions in Africa."" He concluded, ""African nations should strongly resist letting their territories be used for experimental exercises like this. And they must join efforts to strengthen the de facto moratorium (under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity) on the development and deployment of these technologies. The technologies are potentially dangerous, and a major distraction from the real change that we all know wealthier nations need to make if we have a hope of outrunning climate devastation.""

Users slammed the president for seemingly making the tragedy about himself and embellishing how destructive the actual fire was to his house. Several users fact-checked Biden’s claims, pointing out that the fire first respondents put out at his residence did not extend out of the kitchen, a far cry from the damage many people in Hawaii have suffered due to historic wildfires that have killed over 100 people in the state.

During an appearance on ""CNN This Morning,"" Weir said that the study, which uses artificial intelligence to combine existing scientific models, found that ""doom is coming"" to the planet faster than previously predicted. ""Where this machine learning differs from the consensus science is that even if everything is done — a certain amount of warming is already built in,"" he said.

So, they moved it to 1.5,"" he said. The study estimated that the planet may reach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming since preindustrial levels within a decade and predicted that temperatures could tip over 2 degrees Celsius by 2060. Under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, countries have pledged to limit global warming to below 2 degrees compared to preindustrial levels. Scientists have said that the chances of extreme weather, such as flooding and wildfires, dramatically increase after temperatures tip over 1.5 degrees of warming. At 2 degrees of warming, there can be irreversible ramifications on the planet’s population, including ""chronic water scarcity"" for three billion people. LIBERAL MEDIA MADE SLEW OF DUBIOUS CLAIMS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, YEAR-END REPORT FINDS According to co-author and Stanford Professor Noah Diffenbaugh, the study used machine learning and, more specifically, artificial neural networks on climate models and then utilized observations about temperature throughout history as ""independent input"" to inform the AI's prediction process. Diffenbaugh and co-author Elizabeth Barnes ran three different scenarios, which all concluded the world would hit 1.5 degrees of warming between 2033 and 2035, in line with other studies. But the artificial intelligence broke from previous estimates when predicting a probability of 80% that degrees warming will occur before 2065, even if the world reaches carbon net-zero.

BIDEN ROCKED FOR GRAND CANYON GAFFE: ‘HE’S CLUELESS' ""CNN This Morning"" co-host Victor Blackwell urged the press secretary to explain why the administration hadn't done so, if the climate was truly a crucial concern. ""Practically speaking, yes,"" Biden told Abrams. His gaffe was highlighted during an interview with Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday morning. ""But he hasn't done it. He corrected it saying, ‘practically speaking.' If the climate crisis is as important as this White House says it is, why hasn’t the president declared a national emergency? And if so, when will that happen?"" he asked the Biden official. The press secretary dodged the question, touting the administration's ""really ambitious approach"" on climate change.

Last week, lawyers representing the Sierra Club and the California city of Glendale provided arguments over whether to continue operations on a gas-fired power plant located across the Los Angeles River. The city has argued the plant is needed to avoid blackouts and catastrophes for its nearly 200,000 residents.  The Times opined that the courtroom contention is a ""highly technical dispute"" and part of a larger conversation about how much ""blackout risk"" is considered ""acceptable"" in society. Additionally, the piece questioned if society's expectations should ""evolve"" in the name of ""preventing climate catastrophe.""  BIDEN ADMIN UNVEILS SWEEPING NEW ACTIONS INCREASING COSTS FOR OIL, GAS LEASING Experts have previously told Fox News Digital that California's electric grid faces years of potential blackouts and failure as state leaders continue pushing aggressive measures to transition to renewable energy sources. The state's grid, which is still mainly powered by fossil fuels, is shifting significantly from natural gas and coal to renewable power like wind and solar. ""Of the hundreds of people who responded to my question, most rejected the idea that more power outages are even remotely acceptable — for reasons beyond mere convenience,"" Roth admitted. STUDY CASTS DOUBT ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES' CLIMATE, COST BENEFITS: 'WON'T ACHIEVE THE GOALS INTENDED' For example, a former member of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's board of commissioners, Aura Vasquez, told Roth that ""someone dies every time we have a power outage."" As part of his research, Roth asked Twitter users whether society could start cutting gas sooner and save money by ""accepting a few more blackouts"" over the next several years.  Similarly, John Moura, director of reliability assessment and performance analysis at North American Electric Reliability Corp., said blackouts are ""not really about keeping the light on."" ""It's about keeping people alive,"" he said.  Despite these concerns, Roth said he has increasingly concluded that solving climate issues will ""require sacrifices"" to provide for ""the greater good."" Such sacrifices, he hypothesized, could include driving less, eating less meat, accepting large-scale solar farms that will destroy some wildlife habitat and eating the cost of expensive rooftop paneling.  ""Maybe learning to live with more power outages shouldn't be one of those sacrifices. But at the same time, we might not have a choice,"" he added.  BIDEN ADMIN APPROVES MASSIVE WIND FARM AMID RISING WHALE DEATH TOLL Many social media users ridiculed the piece for considering the idea of orchestrated blackouts to curtail climate change.  Rebutting the train of thought, media strategist and journalist Gabriella Hoffman wrote, ""Ironically, it is actually net-zero policies - or decarbonization pushes - that lead to grid instability, energy insecurity, and blackout."" Junk Science Founder Steve Milloy called the article ""peak climate idiocy."" Energy-related public policy analyst David Blackmon claimed the article was part of a ""propaganda campaign"" designed to ""condition"" people to believe they have no choice but to live with and accept frequent blackouts.

Donaldsonville, Louisiana, is home to several petrochemical plants and refineries, which emits massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment each year. The White House and the oil industry are seeking to fast-track a project to store the emissions underground to delay climate warming with their carbon capture and storage initiative. The Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly prepared to grant their request, but environmental justice activists - once considered Biden's key allies - are pushing back, according to a Washington Post report. ""Don’t do it in my neighborhood. Do it where you live,"" Ashley Gaignard, who voted for Biden in 2020 and started a group to preserve rural land locally, said at an EPA-hosted meeting last week in Baton Rouge.  ""Right about now it’s politics over people. And I don’t think they give a damn about people,"" she reportedly said.  NORTH DAKOTA'S FIRST CLIMATE CAPTURE, STORAGE PROJECT NOW OPERATIONAL Donaldsonville environmental activists like Gaignard say they oppose such carbon capture projects largely because of the communities' already elevated cancer rates and the existing petrochemical plants, which are in close proximity to Black churches and schools. The industrial corridor near New Orleans, which is home to the world’s largest ammonia plant and is the state's largest greenhouse gas emitter, is commonly called ""Cancer Alley"" because of the troubling cancer rates locally. The Washington Post report quoted Beverly Wright, the executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice and member of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, who said she fears the carbon capture effort could be ""the worst of anything we’ve been exposed to, because of all the uncertainty."" ""In the real world, this is an experiment,"" Wright said. ""And this experiment is going to be conducted on the same communities that have suffered from the oil and gas industry."" Chad Ross, 37, also opposed the project, arguing that the town is already overburdened by long-term pollution. WHY AOC AND BIDEN MAY GET THE LAST LAUGH ON OIL AND GAS ""It is called Cancer Alley, and that’s part of the reason we don’t trust them,"" Ross said, according to the Post report. ""It’s still not so good to have all these plants, so many of them, all around us. Anything could happen."" In an effort to reassure concerned residents, the EPA told the Washington Post that they welcome ""public input"" and vowed to ensure ""environmental justice and equity"" concerns are considered in the proposal process. ""It is a feature, and it is what leads to good policy,"" EPA spokesman Tim Carroll told the outlet, claiming that the agency’s regional leaders have ""worked extensively with the state of Louisiana to ensure its primacy application reflected essential environmental justice and equity considerations."" Mayor Leroy Sullivan, who is Black, reportedly supports the initiative, arguing that the money it brings could go a long way for a town approaching the 50% poverty mark. The Post reported that the companies behind the carbon proposals have pledged millions of dollars in donations from developers to fund childhood development and workforce training if the project moves forward. Biden released a sweeping plan in May 2023 to use carbon storage to curb fossil fuel-fired power plant emissions, sparking concerns from energy experts who said that the EPA's proposal would threaten grid reliability and that the agency was being too ambitious with the standards.

PBS host John Yang painted a grim picture of the world as one of ""triple digit temperatures for days on end, smoke from record setting wildfires fouling the air, warming oceans, bleaching coral reefs"" and claimed that many as a result are feeling an ""overwhelming sense of despair"" psychologists call ""climate anxiety."" After speaking with guests, who described frequent concerns about the climate and even panic attacks during mundane moments, he brought in Davenport.

BIDEN ADMIN QUIETLY SETTLES WITH ECO GROUPS TO RESTRICT OIL DRILLING IN GULF OF MEXICO Davenport describes herself on her website as a ""climate psychology educator"" who offers ""climate aware therapy for addressing the eco-anxiety and eco-grief of climate chaos, whether resulting from high impact trauma, or the existential experience of what is occurring on a global scale, in addition to exploring ways of living a more ecoharmonious life."" ""When does healthy concern about the planet, about climate change become this sort of climate anxiety?"" Yang asked. ""Well, from the emerging field of climate psychology, one thing that's really important to understand is we view distress, upset sadness, grief, anger, about climate change to be a really reasonable, even healthy reaction,"" Davenport replied. BIDEN ADMIN UNVEILS SWEEPING NEW ACTIONS INCREASING COSTS FOR OIL, GAS LEASING She added further, ""Because it's built into us as people that if we feel risks, threats, experience losses, there's going to be upset.

The Washington Post columnist, who writes on social media misinformation, was outraged by the idea that teens' social media activity could be contributing to their anxiety and emotional distress. ""People are like ‘why are kids so depressed? It must be their PHONES!’ But never mention the fact that we’re living in a late stage capitalist hellscape during an ongoing deadly pandemic w[ith] record wealth inequality, 0 social safety net/job security, as climate change cooks the world,"" Lorenz complained.  The tech columnist sent another heavy-handed tweet that read, ""Not to be a doomer, but u have to be delusional to look at life in our country rn [right now] and have any amt [amount] of hope or optimism."" Her hyperbolic tweets drew strong reaction online, with conservatives suggesting the journalist take a break from Twitter. ""Taylor Lorenz looking up from her phone to tell us that it isn't phones that are bad and making her a Doomer - it's the reality the phones show us that's bad,"" podcast host Noam Blum noted. ""Ironically, this is the exact rhetoric of a person who spends entirely too much time on the phone. Maybe go for a walk.

""Former generations worked 80 hours, amassing wealth for their families, so that we could all complain on social media,"" author Daniel Buck teased in a reply to Mandel. Others mocked the columnist's outrage with ""Someone didn't get their avocado toast that morning,"" and ""Looks like Taylor's midlife crisis is a rough one."" Andrew Egger, editor at The Dispatch was puzzled by Lorenz's anxious posts, calling them ""bizarre"" and ""bewildering."" ""This sort of thing is so bewildering to me. Lots of people have led happy, contented lives throughout history, and many of them weren't even among the more fortunate members of the richest and most comfortable society that has ever existed!"" he tweeted.

Hold a baby! Do something nice for somebody you know! Go for a run! Accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior! Do anything other than continue to scroll!"" he advised. Retired journalist Richard Belcher had the same reaction, suggesting Lorenz read a book or visit a less fortunate country. ""Hmmm, ‘capitalist hellscape’ with 'record wealth inequality!' She should read some Charles Dickens — just for starters. Our just visit rural Peru or Sudan,"" he tweeted. Others expressed concern over the tweets. Podcast host Tim Pool claimed the columnist needed intervention. ""I think she needs someone who cares about her to take her phone away and bring her to some type of rehabilitation,"" he wrote. Last year, Lorenz attacked Washington Post colleague Helaine Olen's ""absurd and insensitive post"" after Olen called it unhealthy for people to be trapped inside their houses due to fear over the coronavirus.

She still owns the larger Dassault Falcon 7X, which is worth around $54million brand new and has been her primary mode of transportation during the international leg of her Eras Tour.  The 34-year-old singer-songwriter has been under pressure to cut down on her carbon emissions for years, especially as she travels around the world between tour shows and appearances to support boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs tight-end Travis Kelce at his NFL games.

The protesters, who wear a uniform of orange vests, have worn down the public's patience after the frequent delays – some lasting hours.  A trucker's encounter with the activists at a roadway – the Heinrich-Heine-Ring – an intersection in Stralsund used by 20,000 drivers daily went viral. It showed a man emerge from his truck, slam the door and charge at the activists.  The trucker from the July 12 incident is being investigated by the Stralsund prosecutor's office and had to hand over his driver's license until it is completed, according to a Friday report from Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR). Fox News Digital reached out to inquire about the status of the investigation but did not immediately receive a response.  GERMAN WOMAN DRAGS RADICAL CLIMATE ACTIVIST BY HAIR FOR BLOCKING TRAFFIC AS PUBLIC'S ANGER MOUNTS Six activists were blocking the location for an hour and a half, in both directions, before the authorities were able to clear the area. Some activists glued their hands to the roadway, so they could not be easily removed.  The activists who were confronted with the trucker's vehicle expressed sympathy for the legal consequences he was now facing, according to NDR.  The incident follows another that took the interest of the authorities in Bottrop. A woman in Germany was dubbed a ""brutal blonde"" by European media after she dragged a climate change activist by her hair, according to a video posted by Letzte.

Police said they were looking into videos and photos of the incident to determine if criminal proceedings were necessary against those who dragged the protesters off the road. They also said the climate activists were taken into custody.  Activists from the same group blocked plane traffic at two airports by gluing themselves to the runways in protest against mass transit pollution, causing hours of delays and dozens of cancelations.  Hamburg overall delayed, canceled or diverted 46 flights, German outlet DW reported.

The study, conducted in Chicago, claimed that urban areas increasingly suffer from ""subsurface heat islands,"" a type of subterranean climate change caused by buildings and transportation systems, such as subways. According to lead author Alessandro Rotta Loria, an assistant professor at Northwestern University, soil, rocks and construction materials can deform when heated, causing unwanted settlement in the ground. While Loria admitted that deformations are ""relatively small,"" they continuously develop and can become ""very significant"" for the operating performance of building foundations, water retaining walls and tunnels. WHITE HOUSE REPORT SIGNALS OPENNESS TO MANIPULATING SUNLIGHT TO PREVENT CLIMATE CHANGE ""The denser the city, the more intense is underground climate change,"" she added.

Happy to be there and happy to see you."" The study also included quotes from ""22 interviews and 251 survey responses"" asking people working in the environment sector in Britain if they felt excluded by company culture. ""Is the culture changing? Current management has inherited a diverse workforce but are unfortunately not treating them equally,"" one respondent wrote. ""Grievances have been initiated.

Sasser. Sasser also hosts the ""Climate Anxiety and the Kid Question"" podcast. One 26-year-old Native American woman named Melanie told the professor she ""struggles with whether it’s morally OK to have children."" ""With climate change, we’re the driving force of things breaking down, but then also, the planet’s going to do what the planet’s going to do… So… it almost feels, like, kind of shameful to want to have children,"" she told the academic who wrote the piece.  SCIENTIST CALLS FOR AMERICANS TO CUT OFF AIR CONDITIONING IN SUMMER, CLAIMING IT CAUSES GLOBAL WARMING The piece also highlighted the plight of a 23-year-old Mexican American woman named Juliana, whose friend circle ""is mainly composed of queer and transgender, anti-establishment artists."" ""Her friends cite environmental and mental health concerns. Their anxiety tells them that they can’t properly take care of themselves, much less a child,"" Sasser wrote. ""They also struggle, as trans and nonbinary people, with the issues of access to fertility centers and the need to use reproductive technologies that feel out of reach."" Sasser also spoke to a woman named Elena, who is from a Salvadoran immigrant family. While her mother was one of 12 children, her wariness of having her own children was reportedly ""sparked by environmental studies classes.""

Rosalind, 38, a Black woman of Caribbean origin living in Southern California and working as a scientific researcher said that racism is her primary concern when it comes to having kids. ""With all of the anti-Black violence, and the police violence against us, it just seems so unsafe.

""They send their kids out there and then just spend their time worrying about whether their child is going to be targeted or harassed in some way, or potentially killed. I just don’t think I have the disposition to put up with that kind of stress."" Nonetheless, she is reportedly questioning what the future might be like for her hypothetical child of mixed-race with her White husband. The professor wrote, ""In 2021 and 2022, I conducted a series of interviews on this topic with millennials and members of Generation Z, all of them people of color. Some grew up in low-income families and neighborhoods while others were from the middle- or upper-middle class.

In the 1930s, the U.S. Heat Wave Index was four times higher. But now, the media pounce on the idea the earth is warming.","Every summer, heat waves inevitably hit the U.S. and other parts of the world, causing climate alarmists and left-leaning media outlets to demand dramatic, disastrous changes to the global energy system. Unfortunately, this summer is no different.  On Tuesday, U.S. media outlets published a wave of stories about supposedly ""historic"" heat waves in Europe and North America. For example, The Washington Post published an article titled ""Heat waves in U.S., Europe ‘virtually impossible’ without climate change, study finds.""  Similarly, Axios published a story titled ""Historic and enduring U.S. heat wave, by the numbers.""  BARBIE'S DREAMHOUSE MUST BE 'REDESIGNED TO SURVIVE' CLIMATE CHANGE, CBS REPORTS Although certain parts of the U.S. have undoubtedly experienced strong heat waves this summer, there’s no reason to believe these weather events are evidence that the world is hurtling toward a climate change catastrophe. In fact, the best available evidence suggests that heat waves recorded a century ago were more problematic than anything we’re seeing today.  Government researchers have been tracking heat waves for more than 100 years. According to data from the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, which is made available by the Environmental Protection Agency, the annual heat wave index for the contiguous 48 states was substantially higher in the 1930s than at any point in recent years. In some years in the 1930s, it was four times greater or even more.  Additionally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a large database of daily temperatures that goes back to 1948. NOAA used 1,066 weather stations located across the U.S. to collect this data.  According to NOAA, huge swaths of the U.S. have experienced a significant decrease in abnormally hot days recorded since 1948, especially in the Midwest and northern and eastern Texas.  Although it’s true that some parts of the U.S. have seen the number of hotter-than-usual days increase over the past 70 years — including in California and the New York metropolitan area, both of which happen to be areas where a large number of media outlets are located — most weather stations have shown no meaningful changes or even declines.  Meteorologist Anthony Watts, who works with me as a senior fellow at The Heartland Institute, analyzed NOAA’s data in detail and found that 81% of the weather stations used in NOAA’s database reported that since 1948 there has been ""either a decrease or no change in the number of unusually hot days.""  If the available data so clearly reveal that there is no heat-wave crisis, why are media outlets suggesting the opposite is true? The answer is sloppy, irresponsible media reporting, combined with cherry-picked data.  Anyone who wants to show a long-term warming or cooling trend can do so by selectively choosing starting and ending points in datasets that will provide the answer you’re looking for.   For instance, if you start your examination of historic temperatures with figures collected in the 1970s, when temperatures were unusually low compared to the rest of the century, then current temperatures look abnormally high.  If you start around 2010, then temperatures over the past decade appear to have dipped below ""normal"" and are only now recovering.  When many media outlets and left-wing politicians talk about climate change data, they almost always selectively choose a range that offers an incomplete picture of the larger available dataset. This makes it appear as though today’s temperatures are ""historic"" when they are actually well within normal historical ranges.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Another problem is that media outlets have been using temperature forecasts in their news reports as if those figures were actual temperature data. A forecast is, by definition, a guess, and some alarmist analysts have recently made a bad habit of incorrectly predicting insanely high temperatures that never come to fruition.  None of these predictions came true. In fact, some of them were off by several degrees or more.   Heat waves happen every year, but this isn’t evidence that Americans are facing a global warming crisis. When heat-wave data are put into their proper historical context, it’s clear that everything humans are experiencing today has been witnessed in the past.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINS CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The ugly truth behind climate alarmism is that much of it is driven by a radical ideological agenda that is seeking to transform the global economy and American society, not by science. The best way to fight back against it is to use cold, hard facts. And those facts plainly show that there is no reason to panic about our ever-changing climate.  For example, the Telegraph, one of the largest papers in the U.K., published an article on July 18 in which the author claimed, ""The European Space Agency said thermometers could tip 48C in Sardinia and Sicily, while the temperatures in Rome and Madrid could both reach the mid to high-40Cs. In drought-stricken Spain, temperatures were set to reach highs of 44C in Catalonia."" "
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/progressive-climate-activists-are-rethinking-divisive-protests-we-always-knew-was-wrong-approach,Progressive climate activists finally realize protests and stunts don’t work. We told you so,01-13-2023,Progressive climate activists Extinction Rebellion realize protests and stunts don’t work. They should follow our bipartisan approach to climate solutions.,"In an out-of-character move, Extinction Rebellion, a progressive climate group known for provocative demonstrations, now says it wants to be less provocative. The group announced that it has rethought the strategy of disruptive, attention-grabbing protests in favor of ""building a broader coalition.""  A considerably delayed but welcome change of heart.   Right-of-center activists such as myself and my colleague Benji Backer have warned for years that extreme climate protests and media-grabbing stunts don’t win favor with the public. As we saw last year, blocking traffic only creates animosity toward protesters, and starting food fights with famous works of art comes across as entitled and out of touch to the average citizen. Instead, we founded ACC in 2017 on the very idea that Extinction Rebellion recently discovered: unlikely coalitions get things done.  CALIFORNIA FLOODING: AT LEAST 17 PEOPLE DEAD, MORE THAN 200,000 HOMES, BUSINESSES WITHOUT POWER Since the inception of the so-called Eco-Right movement – a network of various conservative groups and individuals who work with our side of the aisle to re-engage on environmental issues – bipartisan cooperation and good-faith engagement have been at the heart of our approach. Instead of doubling down on the tried and failed naming-and-shaming strategy, our movement focuses on finding common ground, encouraging steps forward, and having constructive conversations with key stakeholders. Our approach leaves no one behind, intentionally reaching out to everyone from members of Congress to thought leaders to industry players.  With a slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives and Democratic control of both the Senate and White House, climate provides a rare opportunity for bipartisan wins. Unlike Extinction Rebellion, eco-righters have a history of working with Republicans, Democrats and everyone in between on solutions. And we can continue to do so in 2023 and beyond.   For instance, we helped facilitate a bipartisan dinner for House members last fall, during which we found significant common ground on environmental policy. This approach will be critical in the 118th Congress if we’re to accomplish anything meaningful. In a world full of performative rhetoric and ideological litmus tests, it takes true leadership to reach across the aisle and get to work for the American people without sacrificing core principles.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  The payoff from such efforts is proven: without bipartisan cooperation, the Growing Climate Solutions Act, which puts money in farmers’ pockets and helps our environment, would never have passed the Senate in a stunning 92-8 vote, nor would it have made it into the end-of-year omnibus bill.   These things didn’t happen because climate protesters stopped traffic during rush hour or attempted to destroy iconic paintings. They happened when folks on either side of the aisle worked together in good faith toward a common goal. Politics isn’t always that simple, but bizarre, out-of-touch protests don’t work regardless. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Perhaps there was a time when the climate movement needed to raise its profile in a public way, but now that time has passed; we must instead collaborate on solutions for the challenges we face. For those in the environmental space, we should all prioritize quiet negotiation over attention-grabbing stunts.  It’s time for a new climate movement – one that doesn’t require ideological conformity and unwavering consensus. Action demands all hands on deck, including all perspectives, backgrounds and walks of life. 2022 may have been the year of climate protests, but 2023 will be the year of climate solutions. "

ENERGY SECRETARY GRANHOLM CLAIMS US CAN 'LEARN FROM WHAT CHINA IS DOING' ON CLIMATE CHANGE ""Oh, yes,"" Granholm answered. Granholm claimed earlier this month that Americans can ""learn from what China is doing"" in combating climate change. During an interview at the annual SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, Granholm sang the praises of China for its efforts to reduce climate change, claiming that the country is actually ""very sensitive"" about the issue, more so than the United States. TOP REPUBLICAN RAISES ALARM ON BIDEN ENERGY SECRETARY'S WORK WITH CHINA-CONNECTED GROUP PUSHING GAS STOVE BAN Reschenthaler continued pressing the energy secretary on the extent of China's emissions, the continued construction of coal power plants in the country, and its Paris Climate Accord-sanctioned ability to increase emissions until 2030. China recently hit its coal-production record last year. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, ""55% of China’s energy"" now comes from coal, ""compared to 11% in the U.S."" Granholm repeatedly clarified that she was aware of statistics on China's impact on the global environment. BIDEN ADMIN CRACKS DOWN ON WASHERS, FRIDGES IN LATEST CLIMATE ACTION: 'OVERREGULATION ON STEROIDS' ""Knowing that you knew all that when you made the comment, would you like to retract your praise for China?"" Reschenthaler asked. ""No, my praise for China was on what they are doing to invest in clean energy, even as they are the world’s largest emitter,"" Granholm told the Pennsylvania representative. She added, ""They are also the largest investor in clean energy technologies — they invest four times more than the United States."" Reschenthaler went on to complain about comments Granholm had made in October 2019, in which she said the U.S. does not have the ""moral authority"" to criticize Chinese climate policies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Granholm clarified that she was not referring to China's human rights abuses, but only its energy policy. ""You were still talking about the moral authority of the U.S. v. China,"" Reschenthaler replied. Granholm accused Reschenthaler of taking her comments out of context.

Biden's administration selected the Climate Justice Alliance (CJA) to receive $50 million last year for ""environmental justice projects"" after the group had already started significantly organizing and demonstrating against Israel.  The announcement of the grant was made months after the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, which the group never denounced. The CJA did put out a statement on Oct. 20, nearly two weeks after the killing of Israeli civilians and capturing of hostages, calling on Biden ""to support an immediate end to the violence by publicly demanding a ceasefire within the region.""  BIDEN OUTPACES TRUMP WITH 200 CONFIRMED JUDGES, CEMENTING IMPACT ON COURTS The group claimed, ""For generations, Palestinians have been living under a system of apartheid"" and pushed the president to reject ""genocide with U.S. taxpayer dollars.""

The group has also claimed Israel is an apartheid state.  On its website, the CJA has an entire section dedicated to ""Free Palestine.""

The new tax was born out of Biden's sweeping climate legislation passed by Congress, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a Waste Emissions Charge provision. Although the waste emissions charge was mandated by Congress, the Biden administration had discretion on how tightly to clamp down.  The fee will start at $900 per metric ton of methane emitted over a specific performance level during 2024. In subsequent years, the fee will increase. In 2025, it will grow to $1,200 per metric ton. In 2026, it will increase to $1,500 per ton. Meanwhile, each subsequent year after that, the fee will continue to rise, according to the EPA. BIDEN ADMIN SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE POSES NATIONAL SECURITY RISKS, SENDS DELEGATION TO ADDRESS THEM ""The final Waste Emissions Charge is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden’s methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air, and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a press release. Prior to Tuesday's new methane emissions rule, Biden and his administration imposed other rules aimed at clamping down on methane. Shortly after taking office in 2021, he signed a law repealing a Trump-era action that rescinded stricter methane-emissions standards imposed under then-President Obama.  While climate change advocates, such as the Clean Air Task Force, have praised Biden's rule regulating methane emissions, Steve Milloy, a fellow at the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute, described the action as ""irrelevant."" Milloy said that because upwards of 95% or more of the greenhouse gasses trapped by the earth's atmosphere are water vapor and carbon dioxide, little to no room remains for methane to be stored. VOTERS DECIDE ON CLIMATE MEASURES, REJECT INITIATIVE TO TAX NATURAL GAS POWERED BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA CITY Milloy also suggested the new methane emissions rule will likely be ineffective, considering it targets the oil and gas sector but not the agricultural sector as well.  ""The largest source of methane is actually microbes,"" Milloy pointed out — as opposed to man-made power plants. Microbes are tiny organisms that live in cow's stomachs, agricultural fields and wetlands, according to The Washington Post. In addition to the effectiveness, Milloy pointed out that the tax will also be to the benefit of Big Oil companies, while hurting smaller ones.  ""It's because all these regulations cripple the competition,"" Milloy said. ""Taxing the oil industry, you know, Big Oil is going to be all for that."" Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., who was endorsed by Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions during his bid for re-election this year, echoed that going after the oil and gas industry with this latest tax will serve to ""raise costs and prevent investment."" ""Thankfully, this insanity will end in January,"" Murphy said.      President-elect Trump has suggested he would repeal many of the green energy initiatives implanted within Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

Senior administration officials have signed off on three of the five drilling sites proposed by oil company ConocoPhillips as part of its Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve located in North Slope Borough, Alaska, Bloomberg first reported Friday evening. ConocoPhillips had previously stated that, for the project to retain economic viability, the federal government would need to approve at least three of the sites. In a tweet calling for Biden to abandon support for the plan, the Sierra Club, which has a self-described mission to ""educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment,"" called the Willow Project a ""climate disaster waiting to happen."" In another tweet, the Sierra Club called for its supporters to ""tell [Biden] to stop"" the project. Greenpeace USA, an environmental group working to ""expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future,"" claimed in a series of social media posts that the project would serve as an ""egregious expansion of fossil fuel extraction"" and ""be a betrayal to the millions of young people and local residents who have raised their voices against it."" In agreement, People vs. Fossil Fuels, a coalition of over 1,200 activists ""working together towards a common goal of ending the era of fossil fuels,"" called for its supporters to ""FLOOD"" the social media accounts belonging to Biden in an effort to ""make it clear he must listen to our voices and #StopWillow."" PRESIDENT BIDEN, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS BRINGING 'SECOND WAVE OF COLONIALISM' TO ALASKA, SEN. SULLIVAN SAYS Democrat presidential candidate Marianne Williamson and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., have also expressed their opposition to the project. ""So much for that ‘existential threat,’"" Williamson, who announced this month that she was entering the 2024 race for the White House, wrote in a tweet. Markey suggested the approval of the Willow Project would be a move in ""the wrong direction."" ""We cannot allow the Willow Project to move forward. We must build a clean energy future—not return to a dark, fossil-fueled past,"" Markey wrote in a tweet. ""It doesn’t matter which way this oil flows, it’s the wrong direction."" Oregon Democrat Sen. Jeff Merkley also bashed the reported move by the Biden administration to give the go-ahead to the Willow Project, calling the move by Biden a ""betrayal"" of his promises. ""This MUST not be the case @POTUS. The Willow project is a climate disaster waiting to happen that would devastate wildlife, lands, AK communities, and our climate,"" the environmental group wrote.

""You can't ask other countries to forego their fossil fuels if we keep greenlighting projects here in America."" Merkley also suggested in a separate post that fifty years from now, the move to approve the drilling project ""may well be viewed as the knife that killed any possibility of international agreement to control runaway temperature increases with devastating consequences."" Dozens of other activists weighed in on the administration's reported approval of the project, with several claiming that it would have an impact on Democratic support for Biden moving forward. ""The Willow Project, an $8bn oil project, is an existential threat to Alaskan Native communities. Biden is expected to approve it to fill the gap left by a US-led Western boycott of Russian oil and gas. US carbon imperialism starts at home,"" Indigenous organizer and journalist Nick Estes wrote in a tweet. ""A ‘climate President’ wouldn’t approve the Willow Project,"" Nina Turner, a senior fellow at the New School's Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, said of Biden in a tweet. Bill McKibben – an author and environmentalist who founded 350, a self-described ""international movement of ordinary people working to end the age of fossil fuels and build a world of community-led renewable energy for all"" – also took aim at the Biden administration's likely approval of the Willow Project, claiming it is a ""world-class carbon bomb."" ""Supposedly the White House is close to approving a vast new oil complex – the #WillowProject  – in Alaska. One hopes that they'll rethink: it's a world-class carbon bomb, and base voters young and old just hate it. Jimmy Carter helped preserve Alaska – over to you, Joe Biden,"" McKibben wrote in a tweet. Aidan DiMarco, president of the New Jersey Young Progressive Democrats, said he will relinquish his support for Biden if the Willow Project reaches fruition, writing in a tweet that he ""will not be supporting, voting, or volunteering for him if he’s the nominee"" should the project receive the president's approval. ""I’m a proud Democrat, but I refuse to vote for ANY Democrat that pushes us in the wrong direction when it comes to tackling the climate crisis. I want to live on a habitable planet, and I will vote for a candidate that is fighting for my right to live on a healthy planet,"" DiMarco wrote in a separate tweet. Environmentalist Dallas Goldtooth also weighed in on this issue through Twitter, concluding that ""NO ONE can tell me @JoeBiden takes climate serious IF he approves the #WillowProject."" ""If he approves this massive climate bomb - he has utterly failed. This will be HIS legacy to a burning planet,"" Goldtooth claimed. Earlier this month, actor Mark Ruffalo called for the Biden administration to abandon the drilling initiative, referring to it as a ""ticking carbon bomb"" as he urged his followers to press Biden and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to reject the project. ""This $8B oil drilling project is a ticking carbon bomb with damaging effects on Indigenous communities and wildlife,"" Ruffalo wrote in a post shared to Twitter.

They listed potential family loss or separation, school interruption, and ""feelings of uncertainty about the future and a belief that their government is not protecting them from climate change, all of which result in anxiety, trauma, shock, post-traumatic stress disorder, and chronic impacts."" It added that kids are ""especially susceptible to air pollution given their developing lungs, higher ventilation rate, and higher levels of physical activity,"" and said climate change leads to a longer pollen season that contributes to allergic rhinitis. Children, the lawmakers said, will shoulder the cost of climate change more than anyone as ""global temperature will saddle children with an enormous, perhaps incalculable, cost burden."" These burdens, the resolution argued, come even as they are unable to vote. CORI BUSH'S CAMPAIGN FLOUTS FINANCIAL FILING DEADLINE ""[C]hildren are a politically powerless minority without economic or political power to influence climate and energy policy, as they are denied the right to vote until they become 18 years old, and their interests are subjugated to the interests of adults,"" the resolution states.

The new standards apply to ""heavy-duty vocational vehicles,"" which also include garbage trucks and bobtails. While the Biden administration and its agencies have strenuously denied the new rules represent a forthcoming ""ban"" on internal combustion engines, plaintiffs were not convinced as they filed petitions in Washington, D.C., federal court this week. The American Petroleum Institute (API) led one suit, which included the American Farm Bureau Federation, Corn Growers Association and Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. EPA SUED BY CONSUMER, MANUFACTURING, AGRICULTURAL COALITIONS OVER BIDEN'S NEW VEHICLE EMISSIONS RULE The groups named the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Biden-appointed administrator Michael Regan as defendants, while a group headlined by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) named only the agency. The latter suit included energy production-related groups on the Gulf Coast, marketing groups, California manufacturing associations, and a machinist and aerospace workers union. The API-led action alleged the EPA’s final rule on heavy-duty vehicles violates federal law prohibiting ""arbitrary and capricious"" statutory provisions, and they petitioned the court to throw it out. AFPM’s court action claimed the EPA’s new regulation wrongly imposes an electrification mandate on the nation’s trucking sector. ""The EPA does not have authority under the Clean Air Act to restrict Americans’ access to or use of internal combustion engine technology,"" AFPM general counsel Rich Moskowitz told Fox News Digital. ""The Heavy-Duty Vehicle (HDV) regulation finalized this spring aims to phase-out trucks that run on American-made, American-grown diesel, biodiesel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas [and] Americans will pay dearly because of it."" GREEN GOVERNANCE THE NEW GUISE FOR MERCANTILISM, WILL LEAD TO GLOBAL INSTABILITY: EXPERT Moskowitz added that the EPA’s policies will put undue strain on the national electric grid, cause traffic problems and wrongly make a sweeping policy change without Congress’ blessing. A representative for API echoed Moskowitz’ sentiments, telling Fox News Digital the group is defending consumers who rely on trucks to deliver goods they use every day.  ""The EPA is forcing a switch to technology that simply does not presently exist for these kinds of vehicles – and even if it were someday possible, it will almost certainly have consequences for your average American,"" API Senior Vice President Ryan Meyers said. ""This is sadly yet another example of this administration pushing unpopular policy mandates that lack statutory authority, and we look forward to holding them accountable in court."" An official with the corn growers group said that the rule unduly hurts U.S. grain farmers who help supply the ethanol now otherwise standard in American gasoline. ""EPA has tried to impose a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing climate change by prioritizing electric vehicles over other climate remedies like corn ethanol,"" Minnesota farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Harold Wolle said. ""Ethanol is not only critical in the climate fight, but it also saves consumers money at the pump while benefiting America’s rural economies. We look forward to making this case in court."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In an official fact sheet covering its March announcement of the new emissions rules, the EPA called them ""technology-neutral and performance-based; allowing each manufacturer to choose what set of emissions control technologies is best suited to meet the standards and the needs of their customers."" ""These greenhouse gas reductions will benefit all U.S. residents, including populations such as people of color, low-income populations, indigenous peoples, and/or children that may be especially vulnerable to various forms of damages associated with climate change."" The EPA did not respond to a request for comment on the truck rule lawsuit, but told Fox News Digital, in response to the light-duty truck and car rule petition, the new rule does not negatively affect consumers or choice. ""By encouraging continued development of more efficient vehicles, EPA’s standards … accelerate[e] adoption of technologies that reduce fuel and maintenance costs as well as pollution,"" an EPA spokesperson said at the time."

On Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it will try to ""incentivize"" the oil and gas industry to reduce methane emissions by imposing a Waste Emissions Charge, allowed under the Inflation Reduction Act.  Under the Biden administration's new rule, certain oil and gas facilities would be charged $900 per metric ton of ""wasteful"" emissions in CY 2024, $1,200 for CY 2025 and $1,500 for CY 2026. The charge would be applied to high-emitting facilities and those with emissions of ""more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program,"" according to the EPA. TRUMP TAPS FORMER NEW YORK REP LEE ZELDIN TO LEAD EPA Opponents of the new rule are already making plans to avert the proposed methane fee. In a press release Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute released a policy road map for the incoming Trump administration and hit back against the EPA's final rule. TRUMP TO INSTALL ‘ENERGY CZAR’ TO DISMANTLE BIDEN CLIMATE RULES: REPORT Included in the suggested plan was for the Trump administration to ""end EPA’s methane fee that misinterprets Congressional intent and does little beyond increasing the cost of production for American oil and natural gas."" The Western Caucus also slammed the charge, but highlighted that the incoming administration will make changes to the current EPA's agenda. ""The lame-duck Biden Administration will do everything they can to sabotage traditional energy sources in their final days,"" said Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash. ""The EPA’s Waste Emissions Charge rule will further increase energy costs by placing an effective tax on America’s oil and gas industry that will be passed directly to consumers. Luckily, this administration’s days are numbered, and I look forward to helping a unified Republican government reduce energy costs across rural and Western America."" President-elect Trump recently tapped former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin to head the EPA under his administration, which is likely to derail many of the Biden administration's energy policies. The EPA has suggested, meanwhile, that the Waste Emissions Charge will improve the vital industry. ""The final Waste Emissions Charge is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden’s methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air, and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,"" EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan said in a statement.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Maggie Coulter, a lawyer at the Center for Biological Diversity, also praised the rule, saying that ""while we expect the next administration to recklessly greenlight fossil fuel extraction, it’s heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane."""

Joe Manchin's former chief of staff now serves as a partner to a lobbying firm that has received more than $300,000 from a group that promotes clean energy and a transition away from coal.","FIRST ON FOX: A former top staff member to Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., now serves as a partner to a D.C. lobbying firm that has received more than $300,000 from a group that celebrates clean energy and pushes for a transition away from coal. Patrick Hayes, who served as Manchin's chief of staff from 2015 to 2019, joined Kountoupes Denham Carr & Reid (KDCR), a lobbying firm based in the nation's capital, as a partner in 2021. Since 2021, the firm, according to U.S. Senate Lobbying Disclosure records, has been paid at least $315,000 for lobbying activities by a coal transition group named Just Transition Fund (JTF).  Self-described on its website as ""the only national fund solely focused on coal community transition,"" JTF says it works to ""leverage public and private resources, and guide policy change to accelerate a just economic transition."" Additionally, JTF – which is active in West Virginia, the second-largest coal producer in the nation, according to the Energy Information Administration – promotes on its website the ""transition away from coal."" Hayes first registered as a lobbyist for JTF in June 2021, lobbying disclosure records show. Since the third quarter of 2022, records indicate that Hayes has served as the sole lobbyist from KDCR representing JTF. Hayes, according to the second quarter lobbying disclosure filed by the firm, lobbied on issues ""related to economic development, workforce training, and healthcare for coal workers and their communities."" JOE MANCHIN CALLS 'BULL----' ON DEMOCRATS’ PUSH TO QUICKLY END FOSSIL FUELS Since taking on the role at the firm, Hayes, according to a September 2021 report from the Washington Post, has ""gone on to lobby Manchin's office."" In an August 2022 tweet, JTF offered further support for the Inflation Reduction Act, sharing a quote from an article that reads: ""The IRA opens the door to new cheap and clean generation resources. And it does it all with an eye toward the energy-dependent and rural communities that need it most."" The same issues, according to KDCR's disclosures from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022, have been lobbied by Hayes. The 2021 third quarter form reveals Hayes lobbied the U.S. Senate and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) on those issues. President Biden appointed Manchin's wife, Gayle Manchin, to serve as federal co-chair of the federal government agency months prior and was sworn into the role in May 2021. The Inflation Reduction Act, as highlighted by Americans for Tax Reform, would impose a regressive tax on American oil and gas development that will drive up the cost of household energy bills in violation of Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. Though coal production slowed in the past decade, coal accounts for most of West Virginia's energy use and the industry contributed $14 billion to the state's economy in 2019. Manchin has spoken about the need to innovate new energy sources rather than eliminate fossil fuels.  Through its Twitter account, JTF has also promoted several initiatives, including ""climate justice,"" the Black Lives Matter movement, and the World Economic Forum's plans for a transition to ""net zero"" emissions. In a September 2022 press release, JTF's Heidi Binko, the group's co-founder and executive director, said she was ""thrilled"" about $62.8 million in rewards from the U.S. Economic Development Administration to transform ""West Virginia's hardest-hit coal communities into a hub of green innovation and clean-tech industries"" and praised Biden for making ""economic transition in energy-impacted communities core to its broader agenda on environmental justice."" ""Economically distressed, transitioning coal communities must know that a vibrant future in a low-carbon economy is achievable,"" Binko said at the time. ""The award of this historic funding for the ACT Now Coalition in West Virginia sends a powerful message that when local communities, the public sector and private businesses align to drive change and can secure transformative federal funding to deliver it, a brighter economic future is within reach."" Fox News Digital did not receive an immediate response from Manchin's office on whether the senator has had conversations with Hayes about his lobbying efforts since he left his role from the office in 2019. ‘RETIRE OR GET FIRED’: SENATE GOP CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE TARGETS MANCHIN, RED-STATE DEMOCRATS WITH AD CAMPAIGN Hayes also took part in a JTF event promoting the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. Manchin, who has represented West Virginia in the Senate since 2010, often takes issue with the Biden administration's comments and actions related to clean energy as he attempts to appease those with coal-related jobs in his state. ""I will continue to fight, and I’ll do everything I can to make sure the public knows what they’re doing and what it will do to you and your economy and your lifestyle,"" Manchin claimed at the time. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In 2021, nearly 12,000 people worked in West Virginia’s coal industry, according to data compiled by Statista. The coal and gas industry also supports a large swath of jobs and economic revenue throughout the Mountain State. A study released in 2021 that was commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute showed that the oil and natural gas industries directly and indirectly supported 82,000 jobs, or 9.2%, of employment in West Virginia. Additionally, the study revealed that the Mountain State's natural gas industry generated $11.2 billion toward the state's gross domestic product in 2019, according to The State Journal, a Charleston, West Virginia, newspaper. Progressive Democrats, such as the far-left ""Squad,"" have called for a faster transition to more renewable energy sources. Such a move could potentially damage local-level economies, including those located throughout West Virginia, where the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the median household income for 2021 to be a little more than $50,000. ""This is bull----. So, they’re going to basically starve us out of energy that we have a tremendous, abundant supply of because of their aspirational thoughts?"" Manchin told Politico, one day after Biden's State of the Union Address in which the president admitted that the country was ""still going to need oil and gas for a while."" Earlier this month, Manchin called out his Democratic colleagues who want to quickly transition the U.S. away from oil and natural gas as a source of energy.

Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes are considered critical to winning the White House. Its reputation as a slightly left-leaning swing state, which former President Donald Trump carried by a razor-thin margin of just 0.7% in 2016, is complicated somewhat by its status as a major producer of fossil fuels. ""It's obvious that the pathway to the presidency goes through Pennsylvania,"" Amanda Eversole, the chief operating officer of the American Petroleum Institute, told Fox News Digital. FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN PENNSYLVANIA The chorus of Democrats now criticizing the moratorium is something of an about-face from January, when the Biden administration first ordered its temporary halt on new LNG exports, citing a need to better evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of such projects.  Now, nine months later and less than a month away from Election Day, Harris is under pressure from some Democrat lawmakers and industry leaders to lift the pause completely. Critics of the pause argue that removing or delaying U.S. LNG supplies from the market deprives European buyers of a cleaner, lower-emission form of energy — forcing some countries to turn to Russian gas or coal instead.  It could also affect U.S. relationships, American energy leadership and investments in massive domestic projects in the years ahead. Pennsylvania is the second-largest producer of natural gas in the U.S., behind Texas. Its gas reserves are contained behind shale rock and must be extracted by fracking — a technology viewed as controversial at best by many on the left and one that Harris has only recently endorsed. FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: THE BIGGEST SURPRISES COME AFTER OCTOBER The fossil fuel industry supports more than 423,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, and contributes more than $75 billion to its economy, according to estimates from PwC. Therefore, the future of the LNG industry carries outsize importance to most voters, industry group leaders and former DOE officials told Fox News in a series of interviews. In fact, Pennsylvania's Democratic Senate delegation, Sens. Bob Casey and John Fetterman, were among the first lawmakers to criticize the LNG pause following Biden's announcement earlier this year. Their counterparts in the House have also followed suit as they seek reelection in competitive districts. Meanwhile, Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate hoping to flip Casey's seat this fall, has lambasted the Democrat incumbent for failing to do enough to protect energy interests in the state. A spokesperson for Casey's office pointed Fox News to the senator's earlier letters and remarks opposing the LNG pause. A recent poll published by API this month found that 85% of voters in Pennsylvania wanted to hear more from both Harris and Trump about their energy polices. To date, Harris has declined to comment on whether she will lift the LNG pause, and neither the campaign nor the White House responded to Fox News’ requests for comment. FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE If Harris does intend to break with Biden or push for an end to the pause and unleash more production, API's Eversole said Harris needs to make that clear — and fast. ""If she, in fact, is going to be different from the Biden administration,"" Eversole said, ""then specifically how?"" Rhetoric, she said, is not enough.

""We don't own a private jet. I don't own a private jet. I personally have never owned a private jet.

Kerry has been widely criticized for advocating for drastic climate change rules while also traveling to events on a private jet that was owned by Flying Squirrel LLC, a charter company owned by Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz-Kerry, and in which Kerry reported owning a more than $1 million stake on a financial disclosure. KERRY BLASTED FOR FRETTING OVER CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS OF UKRAINE WAR: ‘CAN’T MAKE THIS STUFF UP’ Fox News Digital exclusively reported last year that the Kerry family jet, a Gulfstream GIV-SP, made a total of 48 trips lasting more than 60 hours and emitted an estimated 715,886 pounds, or 325 metric tons, of carbon since President Biden was sworn into office.

Josh Shapiro applied when he was attorney general to be part of a Bloomberg-backed program that would fund a special prosecutor to go after oil and gas companies.,"FIRST ON FOX: Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is rumored to be on the short list of vice-presidential candidates for presumptive nominee Kamala Harris, applied as state attorney general to be part of a Michael Bloomberg-sponsored program to appoint special climate prosecutors to go after the energy industry in his state. During the Trump administration, the Wall Street Journal reported that climate activists began ""placing employees in Attorneys General offices in dubious private-public condominiums"" highlighted a ""remarkable arrangement"" by the NYU Law School’s State Energy and Environmental Impact Center. The effort was launched in 2017 as part of a $6 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies to ""advance a liberal climate and energy agenda."" The program, which is legal, has placed Bloomberg-funded attorneys in several jurisdictions, including in Connecticut, Illinois, New Mexico, and Washington, D.C., where they focus on climate issues and litigating against oil and gas companies. GOP SENATE CANDIDATE IN PA TOURS NATURAL GAS PLANT AS VP HARRIS PIVOTS FROM ANTI-FRACKING COMMENTS ""The State Energy & Environmental Impact Center at NYU Law studies and supports the work of state attorneys general in defending, enforcing, and promoting strong laws and policies in the areas of climate, environmental justice, environmental protection, and clean energy,"" the program's website states. In his 2018 application for the program, Shapiro’s office said that Pennsylvania was a ""state whose own energy production remains largely based on the burning of coal. This ‘Pennsylvania perspective’ provides a unique and powerful platform from which to create progressive environmental legal and policy change – from within."" ""Put otherwise, while many states can and do fight for progressive environmental legal change, when that fighter is a coal-burning, Marcellus Shale gas-extracting, ozone-suffering state where environmental action may not always be politically palatable, the impact of an environmental leader like Attorney General Josh Shapiro is simply more powerful,"" his office continued. VP HARRIS FACES BACKLASH IN CRUCIAL SWING STATE AFTER HER 'DISASTROUS' ANTI-FRACKING POSITION RESURFACES ""State attorneys general should describe the particular scope of needs within their offices related to the advancement and defense of progressive clean energy, climate change, and environmental matters,"" the prompt for the application states. ""Relevant details include the extent to which funding or other capacity constraints have limited the ability to work on these issues or how additional dedicated support could help advance the work of the state attorney general on behalf of his or her constituents."" ""Priority consideration will be given to state attorneys general who demonstrate a commitment to and acute need for additional support on clean energy, climate change, and environmental issues of regional or national importance, such as those matters that cross jurisdictional boundaries or raise legal questions or conflicts that have nationwide applicability."" Shapiro's office wrote that he needs more ""economic resources"" to continue being a leader of ""progressive"" climate efforts. ""Being a leader of these efforts, however, requires economic resources. Perhaps because of its unique position, previous Pennsylvania attorneys general did not focus on environmental protection efforts,"" Shapiro wrote.  ""Therefore, the environmental section Attorney General Shapiro inherited was notably smaller than those found in attorney general offices of other environmental leaders. As such, granting Pennsylvania’s application will be particularly significant. It will allow the PA OAG not just to join other states in lawsuits challenging the Trump Administration’s efforts to weaken environmental regulations, but to hire one or more SAAGs so it can be more proactive across-the-board and serve as the lead plaintiff in future such actions."" In a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for the State Impact Center said the organization does ""not have a record of why the application did not move forward."" ""To clarify how the State Impact Center’s SAAG program works: it adds capacity for attorneys general, providing them with additional resources to be deployed at their discretion,"" the spokesperson said. ""Attorneys general direct the work of the SAAGs. The SAAG's sole duty of loyalty is to the office in which they work."" BILLIONAIRE OIL CEO SAYS DEMOCRATS ARE 'STARTING TO RECOGNIZE' THE GREEN ENERGY PUSH IS 'ALL A FALLACY' Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Guy Reschenthaler told Fox News Digital that Shapiro recruiting a ""Bloomberg-funded, unaccountable prosecutor to specifically target energy producers and job creators in Pennsylvania is despicable."" ""Pennsylvania ranks second in natural gas production, third in coal production, and third in electricity production. It is an understatement to say that our commonwealth powers the nation. But Democrats here at home led by Governor Josh Shapiro and Vice President Harris relentlessly attack our energy industry and the 130,000 good-paying, union jobs it supports. Vice President Harris even said, 'There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking."" Reschenthaler continued, ""Our communities depend on making America energy independent again and must reject any attempts by far-left influences to destroy their livelihoods with a Green New Deal agenda."" The Wall Street Journal wrote that ""ethical problems"" with SAAGs should be obvious."" ""This is a fundamental question of ethics and who's running our government,"" West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, one of a handful of Republican attorneys general who have raised concerns about the Bloomberg-funded program, said in 2020. ""When you actually get to place someone in under a specific agenda and then pay them, and they’re within the office, that starts to call into question whether there are multiple masters within an attorney general office, and that starts to really stink."" Shapiro, who is reported to have recently met with VP Harris as her search for a vice president comes to a close, has been referred to as a ""moderate"" and ""practical"" since becoming governor and was referred to in Politico as having ""struck a middle"" ground on the issue that directly affects hundreds of thousands of energy workers in the commonwealth, but his past rhetoric could come back to haunt him. Bloomberg has made his position on climate change clear in many statements over the years, including calling for the elimination of all coal-fired power plants and phasing out gas-powered plants. According to Washington-based attorney Chris Horner, who worked with Energy Policy Advocates on public records requests into the State Impact Center's activities, the group's self-declared ""nonpartisan"" label is a smokescreen allowing it to pursue ideologically motivated, ""progressive"" goals with SAAGs he labeled ""mercenaries."" ""Nonpartisan, in that you need just promise to use the mercenaries to advance 'progressive' climate legal positions,"" he said. ""So, partisan? Perish the thought. It's merely ideological."" Presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has previously called to ban fracking, a main driver of energy and jobs in Pennsylvania, but she has walked that back in recent weeks after becoming the presumptive nominee. Dan Weaver, president and executive director of the Pennsylania Independent Oil & Gas Association told Fox News Digital that his organization ""believes elected officials who have expressed past concerns with oil and natural gas development, even to the extent of banning all hydraulic fracturing in the U.S., gain an entirely new perspective on the importance of these energy sources to our nation when they are presented with facts from objective sources rather than emotional appeals on the campaign trail."" ""The facts are simple and compelling: natural gas produces more than one-third of our nation’s electricity, and there is no viable or economical option to replace that amount of energy that consumers demand, as well as to meet the forecasted significant increase in demand from data centers and economic growth,"" he continued. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""American-produced oil refined into gasoline and diesel here in the U.S. currently fuels 98 percent of our vehicle fleet, a general trend that will continue for many years, and replacing that with oil imported from other countries would be expensive and uncertain. Finally, with more than 6,000 consumer, medical and transportation-related products only made possible through the processing of oil and natural gas, their role in supporting a modern society cannot be dismissed with a sound bite about ‘banning fracking.’"" Weaver added that ""PIOGA believes Gov. Shapiro, just like Senator John Fetterman and Vice-President Kamala Harris, among many others, conclude that oil and natural gas are essential to our nation when provided with those facts.""

Waiting and laughing, Pelosi's statement was met with a round of applause by those in attendance. Continuing on with the speech, Pelosi also urged the crowd to clap to for House Democrats who worked to pass the IRA. ""Now let's hear it for the House Democrats,"" Pelosi told those in attendance as she motioned for the lawmakers to stand up. Hearing no applause as she gathered her thoughts, Pelosi said to the tranquil crowd, ""I think that's an applause line."" Pelosi's plea for applause at the White House mirrored a similar request she made last September when she failed to ignite a crowd gathered on the White House lawn. Celebrating President Biden’s signing of the Inflation Reduction Act at the time, Pelosi told the audience the same line. Later during the speech, while recognizing legislative action taken to address climate change by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., Pelosi told the audience once more, ""That's an applause line.""

""As the Secretary of the Navy, I can tell you that I have made climate one of my top priorities since the first day I came into office,"" Del Toro said March 1 in remarks at the University of the Bahamas.

NAVY RENAMES SHIP OVER TIES TO CONFEDERATE OFFICER ""We view the climate crisis much the same way as damage control efforts on a stricken ship. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment,"" he added. Del Toro spoke just days before the Biden administration released its proposed budget for 2024, which calls for shrinking the Navy fleet even though most military experts and senior Navy officers have called for more ships to deter China's larger fleet.  For several years now, the Navy has set a goal of having 355 manned ships. But, for the last three years, the Biden administration has proposed shrinking the fleet below the roughly 298 ships it has available now, instead of increasing it toward a 355-ship goal. CHINA OUTPACING US IN WARSHIP PRODUCTION, NAVY SECRETARY WARNS This year, the Biden budget called for the decommissioning of 11 ships and the construction of just nine ships, for a net loss of two vessels. That budget proposal was met with skepticism from members of Congress, which has acted in the last two years to spare the Navy from cuts to the fleet proposed by the Biden administration.

Should the proposal — included in the state budget that's due March 31 — receive a nod from Empire State lawmakers, it would be the first piece of legislation in the nation to target gas and fossil fuel appliances. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and many of her fellow Democrats in the state legislature have signaled support for proposals that would prevent the use of water heaters, fossil fuel furnaces and gas stoves in a majority of new construction. Despite pushback from some Republicans over the state's proposal, as well as Energy Sec. Jennifer Granholm's declaring Thursday that ""there's no ban on gas stoves"" at a federal level, New York lawmakers are poised to pass the legislation barring the use of certain gas-related utilities in new homes. ENERGY SECRETARY GRANHOLM INSISTS GAS STOVE STANDARDS WILL ONLY IMPACT HIGH-END MODELS: 'THERE'S NO BAN' While other states like California and Washington have taken similar action through building codes, New York would become the first state to do so with a legislative measure. Hochul offered support for a ban of fossil fuel-based heating equipment during her State of the State address in January. The governor proposed abolishing the sale of gas-powered appliances and banning their installation in new buildings by 2025. AMERICAN GAS ASSOCIATION FIRES BACK ON POTENTIAL GAS STOVE BAN: 'NOT SUBSTANTIATED BY SOUND SCIENCE' Should it pass, the proposal would not apply to existing homes that use gas stoves or other gas-powered appliances. However, the state's climate plan could take such steps in the future. As reported by Politico, the three proposals being considered by the Assembly, Senate and governor ""have some exemptions, including for emergency backup generators, hospitals, laundromats and commercial kitchens."" ""The earliest date backed by the state Senate is the beginning of 2025 for residential and buildings below seven stories. Hochul and the Assembly backed banning gas in new homes starting in 2026,"" the outlet reported. The backlash from Republicans over a potential ban on gas stoves came earlier this year after it was reported the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission planned to act on the appliances because the pollutants can cause respiratory and health issues. ""Any option is on the table. Products that can’t be made safe can be banned,"" agency Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr. told Bloomberg at the time. In December 2022, a group of federal lawmakers, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wrote a letter to the CPSC expressing concerns ""regarding the risks posed to consumers from indoor air pollution generated by gas stoves."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP They added that the cumulative effect of such emissions has a disproportionate impact on Black, Latino and low-income households. The group pointed out that more than 40 million homes in the U.S. rely on gas stoves for cooking, and ""methane leaks from gas stoves inside U.S. homes were recently found to contribute the equivalent climate impacts as about 500,000 gasoline-powered cars.""  Fox News' Kristine Parks and Sarah Rumpf contributed to this article."

Shapiro proposes plan to make power plants pay for greenhouse gases,03-13-2024,Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Wednesday proposed a plan to to make power plant owners within the state pay for their allegedly planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.,"Gov. Josh Shapiro unveiled a plan to fight climate change Wednesday, saying he will back legislation to make power plant owners in Pennsylvania pay for their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and require utilities in the nation's third-biggest power-producer to buy more electricity from renewable sources. Such legislation would make Pennsylvania the first major fossil fuel-producing state to adopt a carbon-pricing program. However, it is likely to draw fierce opposition from business interests wary of paying more for power and will face long odds in a Legislature that is protective of the state's natural gas industry. Shapiro's proposal comes as environmentalists are pressuring him to do more to fight climate change in the nation’s No. 2 gas state and as the state's highest court considers a challenge to his predecessor's plan to adopt a carbon-pricing program. It also comes after many of the state's biggest power polluters, coal-fired plants, have shut down or converted to gas. PA GOV. SHAPIRO TO PRESENT BUDGET PROPOSAL FOCUSING ON EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH At a news conference in Scranton, Shapiro said his plan would boost investment in clean energy sources, create jobs, improve electricity reliability, cut greenhouse gas emissions and lower electricity bills. Under Shapiro's plan, Pennsylvania would create its own standalone carbon-pricing program, with most of the money paid by polluting power plants — 70% — going to lower consumer electric bills. No one will pay more for electricity and many will pay less, Shapiro said. IN 2024, PA GOV. SHAPIRO WILL FACE DEMANDING SCHOOL FUNDING CHALLENGES, PREPARE FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION Meanwhile, utilities would be required to buy 50% of their electricity from mostly carbon-free sources by 2035, up from the state's current requirement of 18%. Currently, about 60% of the state's electricity comes from natural gas-fired power plants. For the time being, a state court has blocked former Gov. Tom Wolf’s regulation that authorizes Pennsylvania to join the multistate Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which imposes a price and declining cap on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. As a candidate for governor, Shapiro had distanced himself from Wolf's plan and questioned whether it satisfied criticism that it would hurt the state’s energy industry, drive up electric prices and do little to curtail greenhouse gases."

On Sunday, Buttigieg was featured on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" where he claimed the effects of climate change are to blame for recent incidents of severe turbulence on airplanes and extreme weather. Anchor Margaret Brennan asked Buttigieg about strains on the national transportation system when bad weather compounds a heavy travel weekend like Memorial Day and what he thinks of NOAA's latest outlook predicting a more severe hurricane season this year. ""The reality is, the effects of climate change are already upon us in terms of our transportation,"" Buttigieg replied.  AUTO EXPERTS WARN BIDEN'S EV MANDATE WILL LIMIT GAS CAR OPTIONS IN THE FUTURE ""We've seen that in the form of everything from heat waves that shouldn't statistically even be possible threatening to melt the cables of transit systems in the Pacific Northwest to … hurricane seasons becoming more and more extreme and indications that turbulence is up by about 15%. ""That means assessing anything and everything that we can do about it."" In response, GOP lawmakers and some climate analysts rejected Buttigieg's invocation of climate change, with one legislator claiming weather and public transit systems are being politicized. ""Clearly, Secretary Buttigieg is not serious about addressing our numerous transportation challenges. He is playing identity politics to the detriment of the American people,"" said Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Fla., a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. ""Buttigieg’s latest comments are contradicted by the National Transportation Safety Board and just another example of how out of touch he is with hardworking Americans."" 19 STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL CHALLENGE BLUE STATES' ‘RADICAL’ CLIMATE POLICIES Energy analyst Alex Epstein, a former Cato Institute scholar and the author of ""Fossil Future,"" told Fox News Digital the secretary is also wrongly attributing recent crises to climate change. ""Climate itself is not meaningfully affecting transportation, but terrible climate policy, including that of Pete Buttigieg,"" Epstein said.  ""For example, the EPA's new pollution standards constitute a de facto EV mandate that will force Americans to drive inferior cars and place massive new demand for reliable electricity on an already failing grid."" Another climate expert pointed to the increase in overall airline flights as a reason for the concern. ""Even if the United States stopped using all fossil fuels right now, it would only make a difference of 2/10 of one degree centigrade by the year 2100, government models show. There's no way that these changes can be attributed to climate change. The climate is changing all the time, but there's no reason that these changes can be attributed to the use of greenhouse gases."" ""One reason that more turbulence is recorded is that there are more flights,"" said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, the director of the Heritage Foundation Center for Energy, Climate and the Environment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Furchtgott-Roth also attributed the prevalence of social media and connectivity on planes to people being able to report in-flight issues almost instantly.  However, the Department of Transportation pushed back on critics and pointed Fox News Digital to a 2019 study in Nature magazine that discussed connections between climate change and airline turbulence. A representative for the department cited the study's co-author, University of Reading atmospheric science professor Paul Williams, as saying study organizers had accumulated a large body of scientific evidence now that turbulence is increasing because of climate change."" ""An invisible form called clear-air turbulence is generated by wind shear, which, because of climate change, is now 15% stronger than in the 1970s. We expect a further strengthening of the wind shear in the coming decades, perhaps doubling or tripling the amount of severe turbulence,"" Williams wrote. Requests for comment from the House Transportation Committee's top Republican, Sam Graves of Missouri, and top Democrat, Rick Larsen of Washington, were not returned. Calls placed to Sen.

The Norwegian University of Science and Technology studied moose in Norwegian forests for several years and concluded that the species have a major effect on vegetation growth and are altering the carbon cycle by dining on tree buds. ""Moose are an ecosystem engineer in the forest ecosystem, and strongly impact everything from the species composition and nutrient availability in the forest. A grown animal can eat 50 kilograms of biomass each day during summer,"" Gunnar Austrheim, an ecologist at the NTNU University Museum, said in a press release.  Moose tend to eat birch and young samplings in clearcut forests, an act researchers claim is where the ungulates ""gobble up"" possible carbon storage in trees.

OREGON EYES MANDATE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE LESSONS IN SCHOOLS The study also claimed that moose were not only bad for the climate but aided the forest industry. The solution suggested to the latest climate change theory was to balance moose numbers and forest management in an effort to limit CO2 emissions. ""We don’t only regulate the amount of animals, we very carefully regulate the proportion of females, males and calves. So there’s a stronger management for moose than for most livestock in Norway,"" Francesco Cherubini, director of IndEcol Programme said.

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District is considering two rules that will ban the sale and installation of water heaters, boilers and furnaces that emit nitrogen oxide, which regulators say could cause asthma and other health issues. The move would effectively ban gas-powered versions of those appliances, meaning only those that run on electricity would be permitted. Last week, over 100,000 customers in the Bay Area lost power as a cold front with high winds caused downed power lines and outages, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Additionally, California can't meet its current demand and imported 30% of its electricity from out-of-state sources in 2021, according to the California Electrical Commission.  ""This is just pure extremist politics being taken to the ultimate extremes,"" said National Association of Home Builders CEO Jerry Howard.

""The builders will have to invest in new equipment for the subdivision that's more expensive, again, raising the cost to the consumers.""  BIDEN'S ENERGY SECRETARY SAYS SHE SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA GAS VEHICLE BAN Bay Area residents wrote emails and letters voicing concern and support over the proposals during a public comment period. Over 90 comments were submitted online, with many taking issue with the high-cost consumers would pay to retrofit their homes to accommodate the high-voltage electric appliances once their gas-powered appliances go out. The Bay Area cities of San Francisco, San Jose, Berkeley and Menlo Park have all already enacted legislation that reduces the amount of gas hook-ups, with limited exceptions. The cost of equipment and installation for an electric water heater and an electric furnace costs more than gas-powered appliances, Howard said. Howard told Fox News: ""It's $3,000 for the new equipment and then $7,000 if you have to upgrade the panel and everything."" If adopted, the proposals will affect roughly 66% of Bay Area households, according to the Air District.  ""I’d have to gut my house and live somewhere else while contractors worked,"" wrote Jennifer Huber of Contra Costa County.

""Over the last decade or so, but especially the last few years, the obsession with universities and grant-funding institutions on immutable characteristics of faculty and students and the push for equity in science above all else has dramatically changed the profession of an academic professor,"" Wielicki wrote.

The funding is designed to help tribal nations adapt to climate threats, including relocating infrastructure. Indigenous peoples in the U.S. are among the communities most affected by severe climate-related environmental threats, which have already negatively impacted water resources, ecosystems and traditional food sources in Native communities in every corner of the U.S. ""As these communities face the increasing threat of rising seas, coastal erosion, storm surges, raging wildfires and devastation from other extreme weather events, our focus must be on bolstering climate resilience, addressing this reality with the urgency it demands, and ensuring that tribal leaders have the resources to prepare and keep their people safe is a cornerstone of this administration,"" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, said in a Wednesday press briefing. US HOUSE PANEL INVESTIGATES TIES BETWEEN US INTERIOR SECRETARY, ENVIRONMENTALISTS Indigenous peoples represent 5% of the world’s population, but they safeguard 80% of the world’s biodiversity, according to Amnesty International. In the U.S., federal and state governments are relying more on the traditional ecological knowledge of Indigenous peoples to minimize the ravages of climate change, and Haaland said ensuring that trend continues is critical to protecting the environment. ""By providing these resources for tribes to plan and implement climate risk, implement climate resilience programs in their own communities, we can better meet the needs of each community and support them in incorporating Indigenous knowledge when addressing climate change,"" she said. The department has adopted a policy on implementing Indigenous knowledge, said Assistant Secretary of the Interior Bryan Newland, a citizen of the Bay Mills Indian Community. ""We are also investing in tribes’ ability to use their knowledge to solve these problems and address these challenges close to home,"" he said. The funding will come from President Joe Biden’s Investing in America agenda, which draws from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and annual appropriations. INTERIOR SECRETARY ACCUSED OF 'APPARENT ETHICAL BREACHES' OVER OIL AND GAS DRILLING BAN The funding is the largest annual amount awarded through the Tribal Climate Resilience Annual Awards Program, which was established in 2011 to help tribes and tribal organizations respond to climate change. It will go toward the planning and implementation projects for climate adaptation, community-led relocation, ocean management, and habitat restoration. The injection of federal funding is part of Biden’s commitment to working with tribal nations, said Tom Perez, a senior adviser to the president, and it underscores the administration’s recognition that in the past the U.S. has left too many communities behind. ""We will not allow that to happen in the future,"" he said. In 2022, the administration committed $135 million to 11 tribal nations to relocate infrastructure facing climate threats like wildfires, coastal erosion and extreme weather. It could cost up to $5 billion over the next 50 years to address climate-related relocation needs in tribal communities, according to a 2020 Bureau of Indian Affairs study."
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-ruled-montana-officials-can-no-longer-ignore-climate-change-contributions,US ruled Montana officials can no longer ignore its climate change contributions,08-16-2023,"In a first-of-its-kind trial, a judge ruled that officials in Montana, home to some of the world’s largest coal reserves, must constitutionally protect residents from climate change.","Young environmental activists prevailed in a closely watched Montana lawsuit that said state officials weren't doing enough to protect them from climate change. Legal observers called it a landmark victory for the 16 plaintiffs: It marks the first time a court in the U.S. has declared that a government has a constitutional duty to protect people from climate change. Here's what to know about Monday's potentially groundbreaking ruling that followed a first-of-its-kind trial earlier this summer: MONTANA ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP SUING STATE OVER CONSTITUTIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE OBLIGATION TO BEGIN TRIAL What Did The Ruling Say? State District Judge District Judge Kathy Seeley said officials violated Montana's highly protective constitution by refusing to consider the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions when they've approved coal mines, oil drilling and new power plants. Attorneys for Montana argued the state's emissions were too small to make much difference in climate change. Seeley rejected the argument, saying essentially that every ton of greenhouse gas counts toward global warming and each ton makes the plaintiff's lives worse as wildfires in Montana get worse and streams dry up from drought. The judge also said the state can do something about it — deny permits for fossil fuel projects if their approval would result in ""unconstitutional levels of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions."" Montana has some of the world's largest coal reserves. ""Montana’s land contains a significant quantity of fossil fuels yet to be extracted,"" Seeley wrote. ""The State and its agents could consider GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions and climate impacts and reject projects that would lead to unreasonable degradation of Montana’s environment."" So What Do The Young Activists Get Out Of Their Victory? Seeley’s opinion was carefully crafted to avoid wading too deeply into policy matters that are considered the function of other branches of government and not the courts. ""It doesn’t try to set up the court to set climate policy for Montana, which is something that a lot of courts have balked at — the idea that on their own they can figure out how much climate mitigation should be done,"" said David Dana, a professor at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law specializing in environmental law. The ruling applies only in Montana — one of few states with a constitution to explicitly protect environmental rights. The state’s Republican attorney general already has promised an appeal. The federal government, for example, has for more than a decade analyzed greenhouse gas emissions from major oil, gas and coal projects — oftentimes under court order. Yet Democratic and Republican administrations alike have continued to approve drilling and mining projects. If it stands, Montana officials no longer will be able legally to ignore the huge contributions to global warming made by fossil fuels. Whether they do anything about those emissions is another question. ""I know my Montana lawmakers respect the constitution and they respect our governmental processes,"" Vlases said. ""With that respect comes the responsibility to listen to this decision."" MONTANA TRIED TO AVOID UPCOMING CLIMATE CHANGE TRIAL BY DROPPING ENERGY POLICY, ATTORNEYS SAY What Are The Broader Legal Implications? Never before has a U.S. court weighed in to say that a constitutional right to a healthy environment ""includes climate as part of the environmental life-support system."" Notwithstanding that political reality, one of the young plaintiffs, Clare Vlases, 20, of Bozeman, said she believed Seeley's decision will serve as a check on the other branches of government that are promoting fossil fuels. It could have even greater impact if it is upheld by the Montana Supreme Court, bolstering its impact as a legal precedent that could be cited in cases across the U.S. and even nationally, Zellmer said. Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts have constitutions with environmental protections similar to Montana's. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What Other Cases Like This Are Out There? That seems likely to happen in Montana especially for the immediate future. Republicans hold a supermajority in the Legislature and have been strong advocates for more drilling and mining. That makes the ruling a landmark in climate litigation, said Sandra Zellmer, a professor of natural resources and environmental law at the University of Montana Blewett School of Law. There have been few comparable court decisions on climate change internationally, including a 2019 ruling from the Netherlands’ top cour t in favor of activists who for years sought legal orders to force the Dutch government into cutting greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., the environmental law firm that brought the Montana case — Oregon-based Our Children's Trust — has filed climate change lawsuits in every state, with most of those unsuccessful. Its victory in Montana came a decade after the state's Supreme Court denied an earlier climate change case from the firm. Two lawsuits from Our Children's Trust are inching toward trial. In Hawaii, a state judge set a trial next summer in a lawsuit that says the state is violating plaintiffs’ rights by operating a transportation system that produces large amounts of greenhouse gasses. And in Oregon, a federal judge ruled in June that climate activists can proceed to trial years after they first filed a lawsuit that seeks to hold the nation’s leadership accountable for its role in climate change. A date has not yet been set. A previous trial in the case was scuttled by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts days before it was to begin in 2018."

Washington residents face a particularly important decision on whether to repeal the state's major climate policy, the Climate Commitment Act, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. The measure, dubbed Washington Initiative 2117, would repeal the 2021 law and prohibit state agencies from implementing any carbon cap-and-trade system.

""By forcing $5.4 billion in cuts to our state’s transportation funding, it would hurt every corner of our state, putting major road and bridge projects addressing congestion, safety and freight mobility at risk of being delayed or even canceled."" California voters will also see a climate initiative on their ballots this fall.  If passed, Proposition 4 would create a $10 billion taxpayer-funded bond to finance climate projects in the state. Some of these include improving drinking water across the state, wildfire prevention efforts, and protecting coastal areas from sea level rise. Opponents of the ballot measure call it too pricey, suggesting that there would be financial implications to passing it. ""Prop 4 is a Democrat political wishlist disguised as so-called ‘climate action,’ saddling taxpayers with nearly $20 billion in Wall Street debt.

""Don’t be fooled by claims of progress; Prop 4 won’t address any of the major issues facing our state, but will leave taxpayers bearing the cost of yet another massive loan."" The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association (HJTA) also said the state should not take a loan-based approach to climate-related mitigation. ""Clean water and fire mitigation are important priorities that should be funded in the budget, first, not last. Proposition 4 instead borrows $10 billion, which has to be repaid with interest. This is the most expensive way to pay for anything.

San Diego oceanographer used 90 years of seismic data in new research finding that California winter wave heights may be increasing amid a changing climate.,"California winter wave heights may be increasing under climate change, researchers say.  In a study published Tuesday in the Journal of Geophysical Research - Oceans, U.C. San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography's researcher emeritus Peter Bromirski used 90 years of seismic data to infer wave heights, revealing that the average heights of winter waves along the Golden State's coast has increased as the planet has warmed. Bromirski used seismic records dating back to 1931 to infer wave height, filtering out the ""noise"" of actual earthquakes.  He explained in a release that when waves reach shallow coastal waters, some of their energy is reflected back out to sea, and when that energy collides with approaching waves, the collision creates a downward pressure signal that is converted in seismic energy at the seafloor. That seismic energy moves inland in the form of seismic waves that can be detected by seismographs. The strength of that seismic signal directly relates to wave height, allowing inference of one from the other.  WORLD'S HEAVIEST ANIMAL MAY BE ANCIENT WHALE FOUND IN THE PERUVIAN DESERT, SCIENTISTS SAY Notably, buoys that directly measure wave heights along the California coast have only been collected since around 1980.  After a years-long process of digitizing analog seismic records held at U.C. Berkeley from 1931 to 1992, with the help of undergraduate students, the researcher was able to transform the data into wave heights.  His analysis found that post-1970 California's average winter wave height has increased by 13% in comparison with the same average between 1931 and 1969.  Between 1996 and 2016, there were about twice as many storm events that produced waves greater than 13 feet high along the California coast, compared with the years 1949 to 1969.  PRESIDENT BIDEN TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE EFFORTS AMID RECORD-HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE WEST ""After 1970, there is a consistently higher rate of large wave events,"" Bromirski said in a release. ""It’s not uncommon to have a winter with high wave activity, but those winters occurred less frequently prior to 1970. Now, there are few winters with particularly low wave activity. And the fact that this change coincides with the acceleration of global warming near 1970 is consistent with increased storm activity over the North Pacific resulting from climate change.""  Should winter waves off California continue to grow under climate change, he says it could amplify the effects of sea-level rise and have significant implications for coastal flooding and erosion. ""Waves ride on top of the sea level, which is rising due to climate change,"" the oceanographer said. ""When sea levels are elevated even further during storms, more wave energy can potentially reach vulnerable sea cliffs, flood low-lying regions, or damage coastal infrastructure.""  To understand how results compared with atmospheric patterns over the northern Pacific, Bromirski looked at the Aleutian Low, a semi-permanent wintertime low pressure system located near Alaska’s Aleutian Islands. The study said that the intensity of that low has generally increased since 1970. A more pronounced Aleutian Low typically corresponds to increased storm activity and intensity. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  ""That intensification is a good confirmation that what we are seeing in the wave record derived from seismic data is consistent with increased storm activity,"" Bromirski added. ""If Pacific storms and the waves they produce keep intensifying as climate change progresses and sea-level rises, it creates a new dimension that needs to be considered in terms of trying to anticipate coastal impacts in California.""

https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-change-threatens-brazils-beloved-spixs-macaw-animated-rio-films,Climate change threatens Brazil's beloved Spix's macaw from animated 'Rio' films,05-28-2024,"In Brazil’s Northeast, a South African couple is reintroducing the Spix’s macaw to nature through breeding and reintroduction efforts, according to officials.","All Spix’s macaws are majestically blue in the blazing sun of Brazil's Northeast, but each bird is distinct to Candice and Cromwell Purchase. As the parrots soar squawking past their home, the couple can readily identify bird No. 17 by its smooth feathers and can tell No. 16 from No. 22, which has two beads attached to its radio collar. This familiarity offers a glimpse of the South African couple’s commitment to saving one of the world's most critically endangered species. The parrot — endemic to a small fraction of the Sao Francisco River basin and already rare in the 19th century — was declared extinct in the wild in 2000, when a lonely surviving male disappeared following decades of poaching and habitat destruction from livestock overgrazing. The few remaining birds were scattered in private collections around the world. For the Spix's macaws, immortalized in the popular animated ""Rio"" films, the road back from the edge of extinction has been a long, winding and bumpy one. SCIENTISTS SAY ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS AS ESSENTIAL AS EVER AFTER 50 YEARS OF SUCCESS Threats that had devastated the Spix’s macaws still loom, and the birds now face another menace: climate change. The species’ original territory overlaps what has recently been officially designated Brazil’s first arid climate region. The drier conditions worry Cromwell Purchase because of their potential impact on habitat for the few surviving Spix’s macaws. ""A dry area only gets rain for a very short period of the year. A drought in that period might go an entire year before you’re going to get your next rain,"" said Purchase, a tall and slim 46-year-old. ""The animals are adapted to harsh environments, but they are on the edge. Any small increment of change will decimate populations."" In November, two federal research institutes released a study of rainfall water loss in plants and soil between 1960 and 2020. It showed that northern Bahia state, including Curaca, where the Spix’s macaws are trying to survive, is now consistent with a desert area. It also identified the expansion of semi-arid climate in the Northeast, where nearly 55 million people live. LESSER-KNOWN ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE US THREATENED BY FUNDING DISPARITIES ""If the planet is warmer, there will be much greater evaporation. So, the water leaves the environment and generates aridity,"" the director of Brazil’s anti-desertification efforts, Alexandre Pires, told The Associated Press. Since 2005, semi-arid area in Brazil has expanded by 116,000 square miles and is now roughly the size of three Californias. The government is set to announce measures to avoid desertification by promoting better management of soil and other natural resources in the region. In the face of the changing climate and numerous challenges, at every turn the Purchases have dedicated the better part of their adult lives to breeding Spix's macaws and reintroducing them into nature. The journey first took the biologists to work with a private collection on an oasis in Qatar. When the birds were sold to a nonprofit organization, the couple moved with them to Germany. Over the past four years, their efforts have been centered in the rural area of Curaca, a nondescript town of 34,000 people. Under an agreement between the Brazilian government and the German nonprofit Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots, 52 Spix’s macaws were sent in 2020 to Brazil on two charter flights. Federal police escorted them to breeding and reintroduction facilities accessible by a 1-hour drive on a rough dirt road, where the Purchases live and work for the nonprofit. The following year, 20 Spix’s macaws were released in the wild, along with 15 wild-sourced Blue-Winged macaws, whose purpose was to ""teach"" them how to fly, avoid risks and forage. Last year, two Spix’s macaw chicks were born in freedom — the first ones in decades— but they didn't survive. All released birds were equipped with radio collars designed to resist macaws’ strong bills. Each collar has an antenna. The Purchases and their assistant check the birds' locations three times a day. Half of the Spix’s macaws have died, mostly from predation, or disappeared. Now, the remaining ones live within 3 miles of the facilities, a compound that includes the couple’s house and a U-shaped flight-and-release cage that's 51 yards long. In March, three more of the light pale blue chicks were born in the wild. Not only did they survive, but one of them also flew for the first time last week, a major breakthrough. ""This event is so important as it shows how comfortable the parents are in their wild environment,"" Candice Purchase said in a text message. ""A remarkable achievement for the birds and an incredible success for the release."" US GOVERNMENT DECLARES RARE LIZARD ENDANGERED, SPARKING CLASH BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND OIL INDUSTRY To mitigate the impacts of desertification, the German parrot nonprofit partnered with a private company, Blue Sky Caatinga, to promote reforestation of 59,300 acres in the territory of Spix’s macaw. This initiative involves engaging small farmers who heavily depend on goat raising. Unlike depictions in the animated films ""Rio"" and ""Rio 2,"" which brought attention to the Spix’s macaw extinction threat, the parrot’s natural habitat is far from Brazil’s most famous city, Rio de Janeiro, and the Amazon rainforest. It lives among the sparse, thorny, low caatinga vegetation that often loses greenery during dry periods. And the bird uses the Caraibeira, a towering evergreen tree that grows near small intermittent creeks, for nesting and food. During breeding season, the trees allow the pairs to conserve energy and avoid flying long distances to feed. When the macaws first arrived from Germany, they were offered various foods from the wild. ""We found that it took a while for the birds to recognize them as food,"" Purchase said. ""But the Caraibeira tree produces a seed pod, almost like helicopter seeds. The Spix’s had never seen anything like it before. We put those in the cages and some picked them up and immediately knew how to open them and eat the kernel inside, which was totally remarkable and took us by surprise."" The project also faces challenges outside the natural world. On May 15, the federal government informed the nonprofit that it would terminate the agreement, which expires on June 5. In a statement to the AP, Brazil's federal environmental agency said it discovered that, in 2023, the nonprofit transferred Spix’s macaws from its center in Germany to other countries without its consent. The agreement will not be renewed until the situation is clarified, but the government said the nonprofit can continue its reintroduction work. The project's funding comes from international donors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The strained relations have put a pause on plans to release 20 parrots per year over 20 years. ""No release in 2023 and now looking like a 2024 release is unlikely. It would be a shame for the project to fail because of government politics,"" Purchase said. There are approximately 360 Spix’s macaws in captivity worldwide, with 46 in Curaca. Despite the hurdles, many residents of Curaca, even if they never have never seen a Spix's macaw, expect them to soon return to flying over the region and not just be seen in countless paintings that made the parrot part of the city's identity. ""The project is already a success. They are free,"" said Maria de Lourdes Oliveira, whose family leased part of their land for reforestation. ""The most difficult thing was to arrive in Brazil. I cried when I saw them going to freedom and flapping their wings."""

Coral reef bleaching across at least 53 countries, territories or local economies has been confirmed from February 2023 to now, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and International Coral Reef Initiative said. It happens when stressed coral expel the algae that are their food source and give them their color. If the bleaching is severe and long-lasting, the coral can die. Coral reefs are important ecosystems that sustain underwater life, protect biodiversity and slow erosion. They also support local economies through tourism. LARGEST DEEP-SEA CORAL REEF MAPPED OFF EAST COAST: 'BREATHTAKING IN SCALE' Bleaching has been happening in various regions for some time. In the world's largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia's Great Barrier Reef, bleaching affected 90% of the coral assessed in 2022. The Florida Coral Reef, the third-largest, experienced significant bleaching last year. But in order for bleaching to be declared on a global scale, significant bleaching had to be documented within each of the major ocean basins, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Monday's news marks the second worldwide bleaching event in the last 10 years. The last one ended in May 2017. Brought on by a powerful El Nino climate pattern that heated the world's oceans, it lasted three years and was determined to be worse than the prior two bleaching events in 2010 and 1998. This year's bleaching follows the declaration that 2023 was the hottest year on record.

She said scientists are working to learn more about how coral responds to heat and to identify naturally heat-tolerant corals, but said it is ""critical the world works to reduce carbon emissions."" One reef that fared better than others last year was the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, which was afforded some protection by its location in deeper water in the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles off the Texas coast. Sanctuary officials didn't immediately respond to messages Monday seeking the latest on the health of the sanctuary's corals."
https://www.foxnews.com/science/criminal-cases-killing-eagles-decline-wind-energy-dangers-increase-report,Criminal cases over killing eagles decline as wind energy dangers increase: report,05-18-2023,A new report found that criminal cases from officials over killing or harming bald and golden eagles have fallen. The AP cited data from the Fish and Wildlife Service.,"Criminal cases from U.S. wildlife officials over killing or harming protected bald and golden eagles have plummeted in recent years, according to a new report.  Most of those permits were for wind farms and over half of the birds killed would be golden eagles.  This comes even as The Associated Press said officials had ramped up issuing permits that would allow wind energy companies to kill thousands of the birds without legal consequences.  The agency said this was revealed in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service data it had obtained.  The article said that dozens of permits that were approved or pending would allow around 6,000 eagles to be killed in coming years, citing government documents.  Wind companies have often pledged to perform conservation work to offset such deaths, including paying money for the eagles – but multiple permits allegedly allow the killing of bald eagles without required penalties. ""They are rolling over backwards for wind companies,"" Mike Lockhart, a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist, told The Associated Press. ""I think they are killing a hell of a lot more eagles than they ever anticipated."" In pursuit of climate-friendly power development, a pending proposal from the Biden administration would reportedly further streamline such permits.  Duke Energy told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that it does extensive mitigation for each and every take and that the company's legal outcome in a 2013 deal did not reduce or change its rigorous mitigation requirements that were met as they set up detection systems.  CRITICALLY ENDANGERED CALIFORNIA CONDORS TO RECEIVE VACCINE AFTER A DOZEN DIE FROM BIRD FLU DEADLY BIRD FLU THREATENS CALIFORNIA CONDORS ALREADY ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION Sometimes permits were approved despite opposition from Native American tribes, including for Tucson Electric Power Co. in New Mexico.  The report mentioned prosecutions of wind companies that continued killing eagles despite warnings, including major utilities like Duke Energy Corporation, PacifiCorp and NextEra Energy, Inc. Each company reportedly agreed to move toward limiting eagle deaths. All three companies subsequently received or applied for permits that allow accidental killing of eagles without penalty, on the condition that the companies took steps to minimize the tally of deaths. The Associated Press noted that Duke Energy and other environmental groups lobbied the White House to support streamlined permitting. ""PacifiCorp implements significant avoidance, minimization and mitigation for the development of renewable energy projects. Efforts include detailed siting of energy infrastructure to avoid or minimize potential interactions with wildlife, curtailing wind turbines to minimize risk to nearby eagles during operations, compensatory mitigation for eagles and implementing advance minimization and avoidance practices such as blade painting, autonomous detection and deterrent systems and habitat modification,"" PacifiCorp spokesperson Brandon Zero told Fox News Digital in an email on Thursday. ""PacifiCorp coordinates frequently with both state and federal wildlife agencies to ensure the best available information is incorporated into project siting and operational decisions related to potential wildlife avoidance and minimization efforts."" Federal officials reportedly told The Associated Press that a permit offered the ""only available avenue to require ... conservation measures."" ""Not every criminal investigation substantiates evidence of a criminal violation of federal law,"" agency spokesperson Christina Meister said, noting that whether criminal charges are ultimately brought is up to prosecutors and that fines, jail time and other punishments are up to the courts and are outside the wildlife service’s control. The analysis found that only around one in eight cases brought under the Eagle Protection Act from 2012 to early 2022 resulted in fines, probation or jail time. Fox News Digital's requests for comment from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, NextEra Energy and Tucson Electric Power were not immediately returned. While bald eagle populations have grown over the past decade, there are only about 40,000 golden eagles. Golden eagles need much larger areas to survive and hunt on the same windy plains where companies have put up thousands of turbines in the West.  The report said that while the Fish and Wildlife Service had initially blamed falling cases on the Trump administration's decision to roll back enforcement of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the agency later retracted that, saying officials were ""unable to identify a specific cause as to why violations and investigations dropped."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The Associated Press contributed to this report. ""The company has served as a convener across industry, environmental organizations and the Fish & Wildlife Service to help find common ground on the general permit development.

https://www.foxnews.com/science/earths-changing-spin-timekeepers-subtract-second-world-clocks,Earth's changing spin may cause timekeepers to subtract a second from world clocks,03-28-2024,Earth's rotation is speeding up due to melting ice at the poles and shifts in the planet's core. This change might lead to the subtraction of a second from clocks.,"Earth’s changing spin is threatening to toy with our sense of time, clocks and computerized society in an unprecedented way — but only for a second. For the first time in history, world timekeepers may have to consider subtracting a second from our clocks in a few years because the planet is rotating a tad faster than it used to. Clocks may have to skip a second — called a ""negative leap second"" — around 2029, a study in the journal Nature said Wednesday. THE LENGTH OF EARTH'S DAY IS NOT SET IN STONE AND MAY SURPRISE YOU It’s a complicated situation that involves, physics, global power politics, climate change, technology and two types of time. Earth takes about 24 hours to rotate, but the key word is about. Ice melting at both of Earth’s poles has been counteracting the planet's burst of speed and is likely to have delayed this global second of reckoning by about three years, Agnew said. ""We are headed toward a negative leap second,"" said Dennis McCarthy, retired director of time for the U.S. Naval Observatory who wasn’t part of the study. ""It’s a matter of when."" ""This is an unprecedented situation and a big deal,"" said study lead author Duncan Agnew, a geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. ""It’s not a huge change in the Earth’s rotation that’s going to lead to some catastrophe or anything, but it is something notable. It’s yet another indication that we’re in a very unusual time."" SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024: WHERE AND HOW TO VIEW THE RARE ORBIT HITTING THE US For thousands of years, the Earth has been generally slowing down, with the rate varying from time to time, said Agnew and Judah Levine, a physicist for the time and frequency division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The slowing is mostly caused by the effect of tides, which are caused by the pull of the moon, McCarthy said. This didn’t matter until atomic clocks were adopted as the official time standard more than 55 years ago. Those didn’t slow. Those daily fractions of seconds added up to whole seconds every few years. Starting in 1972, international timekeepers decided to add a ""leap second"" in June or December for astronomical time to catch up to the atomic time, called Coordinated Universal Time or UTC. Instead of 11:59 and 59 seconds turning to midnight, there would be another second at 11:59 and 60 seconds. A negative leap second would go from 11:59 and 58 seconds directly to midnight, skipping 11:59:59. That established two versions of time — astronomical and atomic — and they didn't match. Astronomical time fell behind atomic time by 2.5 milliseconds every day. That meant the atomic clock would say it’s midnight and to Earth it was midnight a fraction of a second later, Agnew said. Between 1972 and 2016, 27 separate leap seconds were added as Earth slowed. But the rate of slowing was tapering off. ""In 2016 or 2017 or maybe 2018, the slowdown rate had slowed down to the point that the Earth was actually speeding up,"" Levine said. Earth’s speeding up because its hot liquid core — ""a large ball of molten fluid"" — acts in unpredictable ways, with eddies and flows that vary, Agnew said. Agnew said the core has been triggering a speedup for about 50 years, but rapid melting of ice at the poles since 1990 masked that effect. Melting ice shifts Earth’s mass from the poles to the bulging center, which slows the rotation much like a spinning ice skater slows when extending their arms out to their sides, he said. Without the effect of melting ice, Earth would need that negative leap second in 2026 instead of 2029, Agnew calculated. For decades, astronomers had been keeping universal and astronomical time together with those handy little leap seconds. But computer system operators said those additions aren’t easy for all the precise technology the world now relies on. In 2012, some computer systems mishandled the leap second, causing problems for Reddit, Linux, Qantas Airlines and others, experts said. ""What is the need for this adjustment in time when it causes so many problems?"" McCarthy said. But Russia’s satellite system relies on astronomical time, so eliminating leap seconds would cause them problems, Agnew and McCarthy said. Astronomers and others wanted to keep the system that would add a leap second whenever the difference between atomic and astronomical time neared a second. In 2022, the world’s timekeepers decided that starting in the 2030s they’d change the standards for inserting or deleting a leap second, making it much less likely. Tech companies such as Google and Amazon unilaterally instituted their own solutions to the leap second issue by gradually adding fractions of a second over a full day, Levine said. ""The fights are so serious because the stakes are so small,"" Levine said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Then add in the ""weird"" effect of subtracting, not adding a leap second, Agnew said. It’s likely to be tougher to skip a second because software programs are designed to add, not subtract time, McCarthy said. McCarthy said the trend toward needing a negative leap second is clear, but he thinks it’s more to do with the Earth becoming more round from geologic shifts from the end of the last ice age. Three other outside scientists said Agnew's study makes sense, calling his evidence compelling. But Levine doesn’t think a negative leap second will really be needed. He said the overall slowing trend from tides has been around for centuries and continues, but the shorter trends in Earth’s core come and go. ""This is not a process where the past is a good prediction of the future,"" Levine said. ""Anyone who makes a long-term prediction on the future is on very, very shaky ground."""

MASSIVE WAVES BOMBARD DRAKE PASSAGE CRUISE SHIPS IN VIRAL VIDEOS. WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT ANTARCTICA CRUISES This marks the second major calving from this area in the last two years. BAS glaciologists say that the area of the ice shelf where the research station is located currently remains unaffected by the recent events.   Satellite monitoring first revealed signs of a change in Chasm-1 in 2012.  COFFE'S ‘CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE' IS JUST THE 'TIP OF THE ICEBERG,' STUDY SAYS The new iceberg, the release noted, is likely to follow the path of A74 – which departed in early 2021 – and will be given a name by the U.S. National Ice Center.  Reuters reported that the name would be A81. The changes in the Brunt Ice Shelf are a natural process, and the BAS said that there is no connection to the rapid calving events seen on the Larsen C Ice Shelf, as well as no evidence that climate change has played a significant role – although climate change has been blamed for other collapses in other parts of the Antarctic.

""The science is clear this isn’t normal. Alarming warming around the world is driven primarily by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. And that rise in average temperatures is fueling dangerous extreme heat that people are experiencing here at home and worldwide."" The primary focus of the analysis was long-term temperature changes over decades and centuries. The agency said a fixed base period yields anomalies consistent over time, with temperature ""normals"" defined by several decades.  SCIENTISTS PREDICT JULY WILL BE THE HOTTEST MONTH ON RECORD GLOBALLY NASA assembles its temperature record from surface air temperature data from tens of thousands of metrological stations, as well as sea surface temperature data acquired by ship- and buoy-based instruments. The data is analyzed using methods that account for the varied spacing of temperature stations and for urban heating effects that could skew the calculations. ""The record-breaking July continues a long-term trend of human-driven warming driven primarily by greenhouse gas emissions that has become evident over the past four decades,"" it wrote.  High sea surface temperatures contributed to the record, scientists said, with analysis showing especially warm ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific.  ""Well, the bottom line of all this is, the last nine years are the warmest on record,"" he explained. ""And, folks, Mother Nature is sending us a message and that message is we better act now before it's too late to save our climate. In other words, to save our planet.""  Nelson stressed there were no political boundaries or geographical boundaries.  ""We are all in this together,"" he concluded.  In an update on Monday morning, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said it was ""certainly is self-evident that the Earth is heating up"" and stressed that NASA is just as much a climate agency as it is a space agency.

It's so bad that scientists are hoping for a few hurricanes to cool things off. More than three-fifths — 62.9% — of the world's coral reefs are badly hurting from a bleaching event that began last year and is continuing. That's nearing the record of 65.7% in 2017, when from 2009 to 2017 about one-seventh of the world's coral died, said Derek Manzello, coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coral Reef Watch Program. When water gets too hot, coral, which are living creatures, bleach and sometimes die. CORAL REEFS AROUND THE WORLD ARE EXPERIENCING MASS BLEACHING IN WARMING OCEANS, SCIENTISTS SAY In the Atlantic, off the Florida coast and in the Caribbean, about 99.7% of the coral reefs have been hit with ""very very severe'' losses in staghorn and elkhorn species, Manzello said Thursday in NOAA's monthly climate briefing. Sixty-two countries are seeing damaged coral, with Thailand shutting off a tourist-laden island to try to save the coral there. Meteorologists say a La Nina — a natural cooling of parts of the Pacific that changes the weather worldwide — is forecast to develop soon and perhaps cool oceans a bit, but Manzello said it may be too little and too late. ""I still am very worried about the state of the world's coral reefs just because we're seeing things play out right now that are just very unexpected and extreme,"" Manzello said. ""This wouldn't be happening without climate change. That's basically the cornerstone of all the ocean warming we're seeing,"" Manzello said. But on top of that are changes in El Nino, the reverse of La Nina and a natural warming of ocean waters; reduced sulfur pollution from ships and an undersea volcano eruption. DEEP-SEA DISCOVERY: ANCIENT CORAL MAY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST GLOW-IN-THE-DARK CREATURES, STUDY FINDS Former top NASA climate scientist James Hansen said ""acceleration of global warming is now hard to deny"" in a new analysis and statement Thursday. For coral, it comes down to how hot the water is and ""things have just gone crazy haywire with ocean temperatures in the last year,"" Manzello said. He said hurricanes bring up cool water from deep and benefit coral reefs if they don't hit them directly. ""Hurricanes can be devastating for reefs,"" Manzello. ""But in the grand scheme of things and given the current situation we are in on planet Earth, they're now a good thing essentially, which is kind of mind-blowing."" On Wednesday, parts of the Atlantic where hurricanes often develop had an ocean heat content — which measures water warmth at depths — equivalent to mid-August, said hurricane researchers Brian McNoldy at the University of Miami and Phil Klotzbach at Colorado State University. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The world's oceans last month broke a record for the hottest April on record. It was the 13th straight month global seas broke records, and because the oceans are slow to cool or warm, more records are likely, said Karin Gleason, NOAA's climate monitoring chief. Coral reefs are key to seafood production and tourism worldwide. Scientific reports have long said loss of coral is one of the big tipping points of future warming as the world nears 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit of warming since pre-industrial time. That's a limit that countries agreed to try to hold to in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

Destruction of forests helps drive global climate change. Because trees absorb climate-warming carbon dioxide and store it as carbon in their wood, that greenhouse gas is released when the wood rots or burns. This destruction also imperils biodiversity because of how many plant and animal species call forests home. BRAZIL’S AMAZON RAINFOREST FACES SEVERE DROUGHT, AFFECTING FOOD AND WATER SUPPLIES FOR THOUSANDS Here are key takeaways from Global Forest Watch's annual forest loss data. The loss of primary forests - those untouched by people and sometimes known as old-growth forests - in the tropics declined 9% last year compared to 2022. But Global Forest Watch researchers said the destruction remains stubbornly high. The world last year lost about 37,000 square kilometers (14,000 square miles) of tropical primary forest, an area nearly as big as Switzerland and larger than the U.S. state of Maryland. Global Forest Watch is a project of the Washington-based nonprofit research organization World Resources Institute, using satellite imagery. Most of the data is compiled by University of Maryland researchers. Declining forest loss in Brazil and Colombia was largely offset by greater losses elsewhere, Global Forest Watch director Mikaela Weisse told a press briefing. ""The world took two steps forward, two steps back,"" Weisse said. Scientists consider tropical primary forests to be among the most precious as their lush vegetation is the most densely packed with carbon. These forests also are treasure troves of biodiversity. The Amazon rainforest, for instance, is home to at least 10% of Earth's known species. Last year's tropical primary forest loss caused greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to half of U.S. emissions caused by the burning fossil of fuels annually, Weisse said. Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bolivia topped the ranking of tropical countries with the most primary forest loss. That is in spite of destruction in Brazil falling 36%, as President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pursued aggressive conservation policies, particularly regarding the Amazon, Weisse said. Neighboring Colombia experienced a 49% drop in forest loss. President Gustavo Petro made environmental preservation a key part of the peace process with armed groups that dominate jungle areas, Weisse noted. Forest destruction in the Democratic Republic of Congo remained relatively stable but high at around 1,930 square miles. In third place, Bolivia experienced record-high primary forest loss for the third year in a row, with destruction surging 27%. Agricultural production and fires drove most of the loss. Deforestation globally rose 3.2% in 2023, according to the report. Forest loss includes natural destruction such as wildfires, pests and windstorms of woodlands that may grow back. Deforestation refers to people permanently converting woodlands to other uses such as agriculture and is harder to measure. More than 140 countries in 2021 committed to end deforestation by the end of the decade, a goal that requires huge declines in destruction each year, World Resources Institute forests director Rod Taylor said. ""We are far off track and trending in the wrong direction when it comes to reducing global deforestation,"" Taylor said. Brazil, Indonesia and Bolivia led in deforestation, followed closely by the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tree cover loss increased 24% in all forests globally in 2022, mostly because of enormous wildfires in Canada. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Canada's forest loss of more than 80,000 square km (30,900 square miles) was three times higher than any year on record, offsetting a decline in forest loss in the rest of the world. ""That is one of the biggest anomalies on record,"" University of Maryland researcher Matt Hansen said. While deforestation in the tropics is a human-caused driver of climate change, the fires in Canada are more of a symptom of global warming, which leads to the hotter, drier conditions that fuel bigger blazes. ""It's a big deal, and it's a cautionary tale for climate impacts to fire,"" Hansen said."

A new color-coded heat warning system relies on magenta to alert Americans to the most dangerous conditions they may see this summer. The National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday — Earth Day — presented a new online heat risk system that combines meteorological and medical risk factors with a seven-day forecast that's simplified and color-coded for a warming world of worsening heat waves. ""For the first time we’ll be able to know how hot is too hot for health and not just for today but for coming weeks,"" Dr. Ari Bernstein, director of the National Center for Environmental Health, said at a joint news conference by government health and weather agencies. CDC WARNS OF EXTREME HEAT DANGERS AMID ‘RECORD-BREAKING HIGH TEMPERATURES’ Magenta is the worst and deadliest of five heat threat categories, hitting everybody with what the agencies are calling ""rare and/or long-duration extreme heat with little to no overnight relief."" It's a step higher than red, considered a major risk, which hurts anyone without adequate cooling and hydration and has impacts reverberating through the health care system and some industries. Red is used when a day falls within the top 5% hottest in a particular location for a particular date; when other factors come into play, the alert level may bump even higher to magenta, weather service officials said. On the other hand, pale green is little to no risk. Yellow is minor risk, mostly to the very young, old, sick and pregnant. Orange is moderate risk, mostly hurting people who are sensitive to heat, especially those without cooling, such as the homeless. The five categories rest on strict science-set numerical thresholds, like the Saffir Simpson hurricane scale that is familiar for its Category 1 through 5 terminology, though the heat version is specific to location, said National Weather Service Director Ken Graham. The thresholds were calculated using local weather data, local climatology that shows what people are used to at certain locations at each time of year, and localized heath and medical data for when heat illnesses and deaths show up in the area, he said. ""Heat is a threat to our health,"" CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said. She said last year more than 120,000 people were taken to the emergency room in the United States because of heat. Last year was one of the deadliest years in decades for heat, according to government records. Heat is by far the No. 1 weather cause of death in the United States, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Rick Spinrad, citing CDC data of 1,200 deaths per year. Last year was the hottest year on record globally. Both the weather service and CDC will put versions of the tool on their websites. Enter a ZIP code on the CDC dashboard to get more focus on health risks and air quality and zoom in on the weather service map online for more detailed forecasts and explanations. Both versions include heat risk for the next seven days and there is a Spanish edition.  There are numerous other meteorological indexes for heat, Graham said. Those include the heat index, which factors in humidity; wet bulb globe temperature, which is aimed at outdoors heat stress in the sun; and universal thermal climate index, which brings in radiation and other urban heat factors. A version of the heat risk map has been in use in California and other parts of the West for about a decade, he said. ""This is a way to simplify that,"" Graham said. ""You've got to be able to simplify the stuff so that people actually want to look at it first of all and most importantly understand it."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Health officials Cohen and Bernstein said even as heat gets worse with climate change, society can try to reduce deaths by better warnings and better planning. Doctors should talk with people before the summer begins about what vulnerable people should do in advance before heat waves, they said. For example, some heart medications interact with outdoor heat and people shouldn't stop taking their medications, but they could take other precautions, as can teenagers with asthma, said Bernstein, a pediatrician by training. Those precautions will be needed soon, Graham said. The Weather Service's seasonal forecast for May and June shows likely above-average temperatures for much of the United States, Graham said. ""So as summer approaches, it's going to be as hot as ever and even more so if we get above average."" ""Heat waves are getting hotter, longer, more frequent and you're getting less relief at night,"" Graham said, citing numerous studies in the past decade. ""So it's becoming increasingly serious."""

Iceberg A23a ""calved,"" or fell off the greater glacier on the continent, from the western side of the Ronne Ice Shelf and floated in the Weddell Sea before it ended up caught on the ocean floor in 1986. The piece of ice, at a size of 1,500 square miles and weighing nearly a trillion metric tons, is about three times the size of New York City.  The size makes it the world’s largest iceberg in the world, only briefly losing the title to iceberg A76 before that iceberg split into three fragments. The iceberg’s trajectory will see it leave Antarctic shallows and enter the greater Southern Ocean, moving along a path known as ""iceberg alley"" where other chunks remain.  HOW RARE EARTH ELEMENTS FACTOR INTO THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION Famous explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton followed this same path when he made his escape from the area in 1916 after losing his ship to an ice crush, according to the BBC.  Glaciologists and climatologists have tracked the iceberg’s movement with satellite imagery, allowing them to closely mark its trajectory. They have discerned the iceberg is accelerating as it travels out from the shore. WE NEED TO PROTECT THESE WHALES: JOURNALIST MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER British Antarctic Survey glaciologist Oliver Marsh told Reuters that the iceberg could have finally dislodged from its spot on the ocean floor after thinning for the past few decades, giving it a ""little bit of extra buoyancy"" that has also allowed it to pick up speed faster than scientists would have anticipated.  The iceberg could snag again once it reaches South Georgia Island, which could prove problematic for the local wildlife as the chunk of ice could block off much-needed access to necessary food.  NEW JERSEY TO CONTINUE OFFSHORE WIND PUSH DESPITE TOP CONTRACTOR'S WITHDRAWAL South Georgia is home to myriad animal life, including seals, penguins and other seabirds that breed on the island. The lack of food access could endanger a swath of newborn animal populations.  If the iceberg doesn’t cause problems for South Georgia, it could end up heading toward South Africa, where it could cause massive disruptions to shipping lanes.  A23a could end up suffering the same fate as A76 and another massive iceberg, A68, which also broke into smaller chunks as it entered warmer waters.  CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX WEATHER APP The melting iceberg could end up releasing the minerals gathered from its time as a glacier that dragged itself across the Antarctic continent, remaining frozen for thousands of years.

It’s among several projects worldwide seeking to address the decline of coral reef populations, which are suffering from bleaching caused by rising sea temperatures. Corals are central to marine ecosystems, and while these projects won’t stem the tide of damage from human-caused climate change, they are seen as part of broader solutions. The World Coral Conservatory hopes to create a bank of corals in aquariums across Europe that could be used to repopulate wild coral reefs if they succumb to the stress of climate change or pollution. Along with two zoos in France and the originator of the project — the Monaco Scientific Center — the zoo in the east of the Netherlands took in more than a dozen coral fragments from off the coast of Seychelles in east Africa. ""This is the first project where we started to keep these corals with a known origin. As we know exactly where they’re coming from, they have the potential to be placed back into the wild. … So it is very important to keep these corals, as it’s going not very well in the wild,"" Nienke Klerks, a biologist at the Royal Burgers’ Zoo in Arnhem, told The Associated Press. On Monday, divers with gloved hands gently nestled the self-bred corals from the World Coral Conservatory project among their cousins in Europe’s largest coral reef at the Burgers’ Zoo in the Netherlands. DEEP-SEA DISCOVERY: ANCIENT CORAL MAY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST GLOW-IN-THE-DARK CREATURES, STUDY FINDS The Dutch zoo has been propagating the corals since 2022, allowing them to grow in a highly regulated environment before they were large enough to join the rest of the reef. CORAL REEFS AROUND THE WORLD ARE EXPERIENCING MASS BLEACHING IN WARMING OCEANS, SCIENTISTS SAY ""We test it behind the scenes … what works for these corals. In that way, we know where to place them and how to keep them,"" zookeeper Pascal Kik said. Each diver held up a coral — one that resembled a large mushroom, the other a decorative cookie — to be photographed by reporters before placing them on a ledge near the center of the 8-million-liter (2.1-million-gallon) tank. Few of the other corals at the zoo come from the wild. They are either shared by other zoos or turned over by Dutch customs officers after being confiscated. Coral poaching is a major threat to coral reefs in parts of Asia. That would make it difficult to return the corals to the wild. But the team knows exactly where their 14 corals came from, making it more likely they could be successfully reintroduced if needed. Corals area keystone marine species, according to Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society. Eakin, retired coral monitoring chief at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that around 25% of marine animals spend some part of their lives dependent on coral reefs. That makes projects such as the one in Arnhem all the more important to pursue, he said. ""We are in a situation where we really need to be taking any possible action we can,"" Eakin told AP. Earlier in April, scientists from the NOAA and International Coral Reef Initiative said that coral reefs around the world are experiencing global bleaching for the fourth time. Bleaching occurs when coral under stress expels the algae that gives them their vibrant colors. The algae is also a coral’s food source, and if the bleaching lasts for too long or is too severe, the coral could die. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, bleaching affected 90% of the coral assessed in 2022. The Florida Coral Reef, the third-largest, experienced significant bleaching last year. Terry Hughes of Australia’s James Cook University, an expert on the Great Barrier Reef, argues that the world needs faster, bolder efforts to stop the damage from climate change, instead of small-scale restoration projects like this one. ""You can’t replace a magnificent ecosystem with an aquarium,"" he said. Others say every little bit helps.

In announcing the policy purchase last year, The Nature Conservancy said it was the first-ever coral reef insurance policy in the United States. The policy, issued by insurance firm Munich Re, is triggered at windspeeds of 57 mph if sufficiently close to reefs and can provide payouts up to a maximum of $2 million to allow rapid reef repair and restoration after storm damage. The warmer Pacific has forecasters expecting a ""near-to-above normal"" hurricane season from June to November for waters around Hawaii, according to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. That amounts to four to seven tropical cyclones in the region, but fewer could actually come ashore in the islands. The cost of the insurance policy is roughly $100,000, which was underwritten by private funders that included the Bank of America Charitable Foundation and Howden Group Foundation, the charitable arm of international insurance agency Howden Group Holdings, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.

The snow covered area is now shrinking 4.6 times faster than it was in the 1980s.,"The melting of Alaska's Juneau icefield, home to more than 1,000 glaciers, is accelerating. The snow-covered area is now shrinking 4.6 times faster than it was in the 1980s, according to a new study. Researchers meticulously tracked snow levels in the nearly 1,500-square mile icy expanse going back to 1948 with added data back to the 18th century. It slowly shriveled from its peak size at the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850, but then that melt rate sped up about 10 years ago, according to a study in Tuesday's Nature Communications. It's melting so fast that the flow of ice into water from now averages about 50,000 gallons every second, according to study co-author Mauri Pelto, a professor of environmental science at Nichols College in Massachusetts. Alaska climatologist Brian Brettschneider, who was not part of the study, said the acceleration is most concerning, warning of ""a death spiral"" for the thinning icefield. Only four Juneau icefield glaciers melted out of existence between 1948 and 2005. But 64 of them disappeared between 2005 and 2019, the study said. Many of the glaciers were too small to name, but one larger one, Antler glacier, ""is totally gone,"" Pelto said. NATIONAL GUARD DELAYS ALASKA STAFFING CHANGES THAT THREATENED NATIONAL SECURITY, CIVILIAN RESCUES An icefield is a collection of glaciers, while an ice sheet is something continent-wide and only two of those remain, in Greenland and Antarctica. The most famous glacier in the Juneau icefield is the Mendenhall Glacier, a tourist hotspot. The Arctic is warming about four times faster than the rest of the globe with Alaska warming 2.6 degrees since 1980, according to federal weather data. ""In fact, glacier shrinkage in Alaska from the year 2000 to the year 2020, we're losing more ice in Alaska than anywhere else,"" Davies said. ""What’s happening is that as the climate is changing, we’re getting shorter winters and longer summers,"" study lead author Bethan Davies, a glaciologist at Newcastle University in England. ""We’re having more melt, longer melt season."" Pelto first went to the Juneau icefield in 1981 to try to make the U.S. ski team and has continued to study it since, giving up competitive skiing for research. ""In 1981, it wasn’t too hard to get on and off the glaciers. You just hike up and you could you could ski to the bottom or hike right off the end of these glaciers,"" Pelto said. But now they've got lakes on the edges from melted snow and crevasses opening up that makes it difficult to ski, he said. It's also now like a staircase of bare rocks there, Pelto said. White snow and ice reflect the sun's heat, the dark rocks absorb it, making the ground warmer, melting more snow in a feedback effect that amplifies and accelerates the warming-triggered melt, the study said. Key is the snow elevation line. Below the snow line, snow can disappear in the summer, but there's snow cover year-round above. That snow line keeps moving upward, Pelto said. The shape of Juneau's icefield, which is rather flat, ""makes it vulnerable to particular tipping points"" because once the snow line moves up, large areas are suddenly more prone to melt, Davies said. ""The tipping point is when that snow line goes above your entire icefield, ice sheet, ice glacier, whichever one,"" Pelto said. ""And so for the Juneau icefield, 2019, 2018, showed that you are not that far away from that tipping point."" Even if all the snow in the Juneau icefield would melt, and that's a long way away, it would not add much to global sea levels, Pelto said. But it is a big tourist destination and cultural hot spot, Davies said. ""It is worrisome because in the future the Arctic is going to be transformed beyond contemporary recognition,"" said Julienne Stroeve, a University of Manitoba ice scientist who wasn't part of the study. ""It's just another sign of a large transformation in all the ice components (permafrost, sea ice, land ice) that communities depend on."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Davies said the team was able to get such a long-term picture of the icefield’s melting from satellite images, airplane overflights, pictures stored away in drums in a warehouse and historical local measurements, stitching them all together like a giant jigsaw puzzle with most of the pieces being nearly all white. Five different outside experts said the research made sense and fits with other observations. Michael Zemp, head of the World Glacier Monitoring Service, said it shows ""that we need urgent and tangible actions to save at least some of the remaining ice."" ""We’re 40 years from when I first saw the glacier. And so, 40 years from now, what is it going to look like?"" Pelto said. ""I do think by then the Juneau icefield will be past the tipping point.""

Just this week, New York state stalled three major planned offshore wind farms. According to Interior's schedule, this year the agency will hold lease sales for areas in the Central Atlantic, Gulf of Maine, Gulf of Mexico and Oregon. In 2025, it will hold a single sale in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2026, it will hold an auction in the Central Atlantic. In 2027, two sales are scheduled -- the Gulf of Mexico and New York Bight. In 2028, Interior aims to hold four auctions -- in California, an undetermined U.S. territory, the Gulf of Maine and Hawaii. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The timing of the sales is linked to the administration's five-year schedule to offer acreage to oil and gas companies for offshore development. A provision in Biden's landmark climate change law, the Inflation Reduction Act, requires that Interior must offer at least 60 million acres for oil and gas leasing a year before issuing an offshore wind lease. The U.S. last held an oil and gas auction in December of last year and will not hold another one until 2025 under a scaled back five-year drilling plan finalized last year. Interior has held just four offshore wind auctions since Biden took office in 2021. The last one, in the Gulf of Mexico last August, attracted lackluster industry interest."

""Controligarchs,"" which hits bookshelves Tuesday, examines billionaires like Bill Gates and how their wealth controls the levers of power that dominate the everyday life of average Americans. Author and investigative journalist Seamus Bruner — who led teams whose findings sparked multiple FBI investigations and congressional probes into the Clinton and Biden families — says that his research uncovered Gates's efforts to buy up American farmland and invest in synthetic dairy and lab-grown meats in the name of preventing climate change. In the process, Bruner says, Gates is doing more to inflate his net worth than eliminate carbon emissions. ""First, it was patented seeds and patented fertilizers, and now they are patenting meat alternatives. Banning cattle would grant effective monopolies to the alternative protein companies and benefit investors such as Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and even BlackRock.

One chapter of the book focuses on ""the war on farmers"" and makes the case that tech giants like Gates are monopolizing the nation’s food supply. ""The takeover of the food system, like so many other control schemes in this book, began with the Rockefellers and was advanced by Bill Gates. Like most of their monopolies — from oil to software and eventually biotechnology — the takeover of food is all about controlling the intellectual property of food production through trademarks, copyrights, and patents,"" the book states.  Bruner outlines Gates’ connection to ""the Green Revolution"" – a series of agricultural advances made possible by Rockefeller-funded research and design in the 1940s to help solve the crises of poverty and starvation at the time. ""The Green Revolution was simultaneous proof that problems like poverty and famine could be solved through human innovation and that the solutions, such as genetically modified pesticide-resistant crops, can present new problems like pollution, resource exhaustion and the consolidation of small-scale and family-owned farms into giant corporate-controlled farms,"" it reads. ELON MUSK, FARMERS TORCH IRELAND GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL TO SLAUGHTER 200K COWS TO MEET EU CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS ""But rather than take responsibility for the new problems, the Rockefellers took all the credit for the crop abundance while blaming the new problems on the convenient scapegoat of climate change,"" Bruner writes. ""Now, the Controligarchs claim they can solve the climate crisis with new patented miracle products that happen to make themselves even richer and, once again, at the expense of small-scale independent farmers,"" he adds. Bruner documents the outrage of farmers around the world after the push to ban more traditional and affordable crop nutrients, and he notes that restrictions on traditional fertilizer that the farmers said would bankrupt them were only put into place ""after Gates and his buddies had secured the intellectual property for the replacement fertilizers."" Bruner continues that ""for more than a decade, as he was targeting the fertilizer industry, Bill Gates has also been quietly buying up large swaths of American farmland."" ""All told, Gates has spent over $1 billion dollars on farm acquisitions and the Agenda 2030-compliant technologies they now employ,"" Bruner says. Agenda 2030 is a United Nations initiative purported to target ""eliminating extreme poverty, reducing inequality, and protecting the planet."" ""When Gates buys tens of thousands of acres, he is not just buying the land — he is also buying the rights to water below ground. In addition to farms (and the irrigation) and fertilizer, Gates has been hunting for sizable interests in water and water treatment — a crucial component when seeking to control the agricultural industry,"" Bruner notes. Another section of the book warns Gates’ next target is synthetic meat companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, which have received more than two dozen patents for their fake meat (and fake dairy) products and have more than 100 patents pending. Gates has already invested millions in such companies, although the consumers at large are not yet keen on the products. EUROPEAN FARMERS FED UP WITH CLIMATE POLICIES SHOCK POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT  Bruner notes that that Gates’ foray into the fake meat market comes as the Microsoft inventor warned that cow flatulence is a significant contributor to climate change. ""And it should come as no surprise that while the peasants are expected to eat fermented fungi, lab-grown meats, and maggot milkshakes, the Controligarchs — with their private chefs — have no intention of doing the same if recent behavior is any indicator,"" Bruner says.

Since 2022, seven of the state's top 12 insurers have paused or restricted new business, including State Farm and Liberty Mutual, and the government's Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan, intended as an insurer of last resort, has risen to a 3% share of California's market.

https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-researchers-working-new-ocean-based-climate-solution,California researchers working on new ocean-based climate solution,04-21-2023,The engineering faculty at UCLA said they have developed a technique that can remove carbon dioxide from seawater and produce green hydrogen in the process.,"Atop a 100-foot barge tied up at the Port of Los Angeles, engineers have built a kind of floating laboratory to answer a simple question: Is there a way to cleanse seawater of carbon dioxide and then return it to the ocean so it can suck more of the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere to slow global warming? Called the lungs of the planet, the ocean, whose plants and currents take in carbon dioxide, has already helped the Earth tremendously by absorbing 30 percent of carbon dioxide emissions since the Industrial Revolution and capturing 90 percent of the excess heat from those emissions. Acting as a giant carbon sink, it has been a crucial buffer in protecting people from even worse effects of early climate change. Plans are now underway to scale up the idea with another demonstration site starting this month in Singapore. Data collected there and at the Port of Los Angeles will help in the design of larger test plants. Those facilities are expected to be running by 2025 and be able to remove thousands of tons of CO2 per year. If they are successful, the plan is to build commercial facilities to remove millions of tons of carbon annually, Sant said. 2 MEN IN CALIFORNIA WRONGLY CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER DECLARED INNOCENT AFTER 17 YEARS IN PRISON But even if the project is able to remove millions of tons, that is still thousands of times less than what will be needed to meaningfully address climate change. Seawater can store 150 times more carbon dioxide per unit volume than air, roughly. But absorbing the greenhouse gas has come at a cost, causing oceans to become more acidic, destroying coral reefs and harming marine species, including impeding shellfish from building their skeletons. The technology, dubbed SeaChange, developed by the University of California Los Angeles engineering faculty, is meant to seize on the ocean's natural abilities, said Gaurav Sant, director of UCLA’s Institute for Carbon Management. The process sends an electrical charge through seawater flowing through tanks on the barge. That then sets off a series of chemical reactions that trap the greenhouse gas into a solid mineral that includes calcium carbonate — the same thing seashells are made of. The seawater is then returned to the ocean and can pull more carbon dioxide out of the air. The calcium carbonate settles to the sea floor. ""I’m not saying this won’t work, but the ultimate thing is how much CO2 will it actually draw down on a scale of decades?"" said Margaret Leinen, director of Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Sant doesn’t disagree. Scientists estimate at least 10 billion metric tons of carbon will need to be removed from the air annually beginning in 2050, and the pace will need to continue over the next century. According to the UCLA team, at least 1,800 industrial-scale facilities would be needed to capture 10 billion tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year, but fewer could still make a dent. The project is among a host of ideas being explored by scientists who warn that cutting emissions will not be enough to limit global temperature rise to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit and avert catastrophic changes to ecosystems. ""That really is the fundamental metric that you’ve got to keep in mind,"" he said. Among the ideas researchers are looking at is fertilizing the surface of the ocean to cause a proliferation of tiny carbon-absorbing phytoplankton. Another would sprinkle beaches with minerals that could be slowly swept in with the tides or deposited on coast beds to increase seawater’s alkalinity so it can pull more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. CALIFORNIA TO MEET 100% WATER REQUESTS AFTER WINTER STORMS SEND RECORD SNOWPACK, REGULATORS SAY None of the projects have been tested on a global scale, and there is concern about tampering with the ocean. Aleck Wang, a marine carbon chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said with the number of ocean-based carbon dioxide removal research projects ""booming,"" there will likely not be one single solution. ""I think we need all of the methods, at least somewhat, so that we can really get to the target, which is the removal of a huge amount of carbon,"" he said. Much of the attention until recently has been on land-based initiatives such as planting trees or building factories to capture carbon from emitters, but they have limitations including costs and how much land they would cover. So scientists have increasingly turned to help from the ocean, which covers 70 percent of the Earth’s surface. That’s why the success of any of the technologies will rely on ""how fast you can build them out,"" he added. Researchers from the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering built the demonstration system in two years. One thing that distinguishes the process is that it produces hydrogen. To remove a metric ton of carbon dioxide, about 220 metric tons of water needs to flow through the system. That produces 35 kilograms of hydrogen, Sant said. Sant founded the Los Angeles-based startup Equatic to scale up the project. It would generate revenue from selling the hydrogen, as well as carbon credits that companies, like those in the airline industry, can claim to balance out their pollution, he said. The aim is to remove the carbon at a cost well below $100 a metric ton. The hydrogen would be produced at less than $1 per kilogram, which would be substantially less than the current cost of cleanly-produced hydrogen. CALIFORNIA DRIVER ACCUSED OF INTENTIONALLY RUNNING DOWN TEENS The project has received tens of millions of dollars from supporters including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the U.S. Department of Energy. Andres Clarens, an engineering professor at the University of Virginia who researches carbon dioxide removal, said it is a plus that the process produces hydrogen, but he’s concerned that it would require a lot of energy to make a difference. He also asks: ""What does it mean for people that use the water already for fishing and for you know, other forms of production? What does it mean for those ecosystems?"" Sant has said a filtration system bars marine life from being sucked in with the seawater. He called the energy required ""minimal."" The system uses about two megawatt hours of energy per ton of carbon dioxide removed but its co-product, hydrogen, produces one megawatt hour of energy. Hydrogen could be used to help power the systems or be sold to be used as a green fuel for industries, Sant said. ""The approach is based on the idea that you want to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide accumulations,"" Sant said. Clarens of the University of Virginia said the sea may be where such solutions can be found. With any of these efforts, the risks must be weighed carefully to ensure the efforts to limit climate change are truly effective and do not cause greater harm to the planet in the process, scientists say.

The established scientist now admits that he ""focused narrowly"" only on the human influence of wildfires, instead of focusing broadly on the complexities of other ""obviously relevant factors."" He blamed his angle on the pressure scientists face to get their studies published in prestigious articles and the need to create catchy abstracts that can be turned into headlines. Brown said in The Free Press he is not ""disowning"" his paper by criticizing how he chose to approach the piece, but admitting it is less ""useful than it could have been."" ""You might be wondering at this point if I’m disowning my own paper. I’m not,"" Brown wrote. ""On the contrary, I think it advances our understanding of climate change’s role in day-to-day wildfire behavior. It’s just that the process of customizing the research for an eminent journal caused it to be less useful than it could have been.""  Brown wrote that the study didn’t look at poor forest management and other factors that are just as important to fire behavior because he ""knew that it would detract from the clean narrative centered on the negative impact of climate change and thus decrease the odds that the paper would pass muster with Nature’s editors and reviewers.""  He added such bias in climate science ""misinforms the public"" and ""makes practical solutions more difficult to achieve.""

""When it comes to science, Nature does not have a preferred narrative. Nature editors make decisions about what to publish based solely on whether research meets our criteria for publication: original scientific research (where conclusions are sufficiently supported by the available evidence), of outstanding scientific importance, which reaches a conclusion of interest to a multidisciplinary readership,"" Skipper said. California Assembly leader James Gallagher, a Republican, blasted liberals by saying that they ""cherry-pick data"" to ""fit their agenda.""

https://www.foxnews.com/us/climate-change-threatens-river-basins-worldwide-snowpack-declines-study-finds,"Climate change threatens river basins worldwide as snowpack declines, study finds",01/10/2024,"A new study has found that river basins worldwide, which were once covered in snow, are experiencing declining snowpack due to the impact of climate change.","River basins around the world that were once regularly snowbound are increasingly seeing their snowpack shrink and climate change is to blame, a new study found. ""Many of the world’s most populous basins are hovering on the precipice of rapid snow declines,"" concluded the study of snow amounts since 1981 in Wednesday's journal Nature. That's because the study found a key threshold for the future of snowpacks in the Northern Hemisphere: 17.6 degrees. In places where the winter temperature average is colder than that, the snowpack often survives because it's cold enough. But areas warmer than 17.6 degrees for a winter average tend to see their winter wonderland dreams melt like the wicked witch of the west. And it's happening fast. OREGON JUDGE DENIES DOJ REQUEST TO DISMISS LAWSUIT ALLEGING GOVERNMENT'S NEGLIGENCE IN ADDRESSING POLLUTION ""You’re potentially in this regime of just really rapid and accelerating losses with warming,"" said lead author Alexander Gottlieb, an Earth systems scientist at Dartmouth College. Most past studies have looked at snow cover, which is a simple measurement of whether the ground has snow or not. This latest research examined snowpack, a more encompassing measurement that includes depth and amount, at its general peak in March. Spring snowpack is critical for delivering a steady supply of drinking and irrigation water to billions of people, with bigger and earlier melts causing problems. University of New Hampshire Earth systems scientist Elizabeth Burakowski, who wasn't part of the research, said the study shows ""beyond a reasonable doubt that humans are responsible for the decline in snowpack in dozens of river basins across the Northern Hemisphere"" and melting of the snow ""will ratchet up with each degree."" ""The study demonstrates that our snow future depends on the path we take to act on climate,"" Burakowski wrote in an email. BIDEN SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE COULD CAUSE COLORADO RIVER TO DRY UP DURING RITZY DNC DINNER: 'NOT A JOKE' Gottlieb and Dartmouth climate scientist Justin Mankin examined 169 northern hemisphere river basins, finding a significant 40-year downward trend in 70 of the river basins, an increasing trend in a dozen and no trend in the others. In 23 of those shrinking snowpacks, Mankin and Gottlieb, using variations on standard scientific techniques, were able to show that climate change clearly contributed to the melt. In eight river basins, all in chilly eastern Siberia, they found climate change helped build snowpack as precipitation increased but temperatures stayed cool enough to preserve it. Europe and North America are getting some of the biggest spring snowpack losses, they found, including the Great Salt Lake, Merrimack, Connecticut, Susquehanna, Hudson, Delaware, Neva, Vistula, Dnieper, Don and Danube river basins. A good example of shrinking snowpack is the upper reaches of the Colorado River basin in Colorado and parts of Wyoming, Gottlieb said. There, the winter temperature averages around 23 degrees (-5 degrees Celsius), seemingly cold enough for snow because it’s below freezing, but not really, he said. ""This is a place where we’ve started to see these kinds of accelerating losses start to emerge,"" Gottlieb said. ""We see this really clear picture of anthropogenic forest snow loss over the last 40 years or so."" Gottlieb and Mankin documented fingerprints of human-caused warming by using the standard climate attribution method of comparing what happened in the last 40 years of a real warming world to thousands of computer model runs showing what would happen to these river basins on a fictional planet with no climate change. Places chillier than 17.6 degrees account for 81 percent of the Northern Hemisphere snowpack, but they don't hold many people, only 570 million, Mankin said. More than 2 billion people live in areas where winter averages between 17.6 and 32 degrees (-8 and zero Celsius), he said. What’s key, especially for water supply, is that ""as warming accelerates, the snowpack change is going to accelerate much faster than it has,"" said Daniel Scott, a scientist at the University of Waterloo who wasn’t involved in the study. That’s because what’s happening is not gradual. Above a certain temperature, melt gets moving fast. Below that 17.6 degrees mark, it’s cold enough that the extra moisture in the air from climate change may result in more snow and increase snowpack, something Gottlieb and Mankin said they saw in eastern Siberia. That 17.6-degree threshold ""tells us more clearly how much risk there is and where,"" said University of Colorado ice scientist Waleed Abdalati, a former NASA chief scientist who wasn't part of the study. The ski industry — with sometimes stark visuals of manufactured snow on an otherwise brown landscape for winter revelers to enjoy — has long been an easy to understand example of an economy that will suffer from the lack of snow. OREGON APPEALS COURT INVALIDATES STATE CLIMATE PROTECTION PROGRAM RULES Many ski areas wait anxiously every year for Mother Nature to bring enough powder to start running their lifts. Others have closed altogether after their seasons got too short. Larger corporate-run mountains, such as Colorado's Aspen Snowmass, are able to operate consistently despite less snow and shorter winters. ""Opening and closing days remain constant due to snowmaking, which shows how important that is,"" said Auden Schendler, senior vice-president of sustainability at Aspen One, the parent company of Aspen Skiing Company. They also invested in building new ski runs at higher elevations where snow is more reliable than at the base, insulating them from substantial economic loss — for now. ""That in no way reduces the urgency of the need to act with force and at scale,"" Schendler said. Aspen Snowmass is among a growing handful of ski areas that are embracing climate activism as the new industry standard, recognizing an urgent need to lobby for climate-friendly policies if they want to exist well into a warming future."

""We’re being forced in this direction by nature, but also by policy and by business and industry."" Supporters of banning gas-powered products have argued that eliminating or reducing natural gas hookups would reduce carbon emissions and help meet climate goals.

""We’re looking at record-breaking temperatures,"" said Miles Higa, meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Portland office, describing the warmth as ""unusual for this time of year."" The unseasonal high temperatures could further fuel the dozens of fires burning in Canada's western Alberta province, where officials have ordered evacuations and declared a state of emergency. Residents and officials in the Northwest have been trying to adjust to the likely reality of longer, hotter heat waves following the deadly "" heat dome "" weather phenomenon in 2021 that prompted record temperatures and deaths across the region. Temperatures in the Seattle area could also meet or surpass daily records, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Jacob DeFlitch. The mercury could near 85 F on Saturday and reach into the low 90s on Sunday, he said. King County, home to Seattle, directed transportation operators such as bus drivers to let people ride for free if they're seeking respite from the heat or heading to a cooling center. The city's regional homeless authority said several cooling and day centers will be open across the county. 3 MISSING IN LEARJET CRASH OFF SOCAL COAST, COAST GUARD SUSPENDS SEARCH ""Rivers are still running cold.

""You’re nice and warm and jump into the cold water — that could pose a risk to getting cold water shock."" The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory Friday lasting from Saturday through Monday for much of the western parts of both Oregon and Washington state. It said the temperatures could raise the risk of heat-related illness, particularly for those who are dehydrated or don't have effective cooling. Authorities also urged people to be wary of cold water temperatures, should they be tempted to take a river or lake swim to cool off. In response, Oregon passed a law requiring all new housing built after April 2024 to have air conditioning installed in at least one room. The law already prohibits landlords in most cases from restricting tenants from installing cooling devices in their rental units. Residents and officials in the Pacific Northwest have become more vigilant about heat wave preparations after some 800 people died in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia during the heat dome weather event in late June and early July 2021. The temperature at the time soared to an all-time high of 116 F in Portland and smashed heat records in cities and towns across the region. Many of those who died were older people who lived alone. One of those nonprofits, Verde, said interest in the units has been high. Verde has installed roughly 180 units so far this year, and their waitlist last year was nearly 500 people long, said Ricardo Moreno, a project manager for the group who oversees its heat response program. ""People we’ve talked to, mostly elderly people with some health conditions, they all shared that having these units have made a world of difference and definitely improved the quality of their lives through the summer,"" Moreno said. Another local nonprofit, the African American Alliance for Homeownership, installed 1,200 units last year and 75 units so far this year, program manager Richard Hines-Norwood said. Temperatures in Portland, Oregon, are expected to hover around 94 F throughout the weekend, according to the website of the National Weather Service office there. The current daily temperature records for May 13 and 14 stand at 92 F and 91 F dating from 1973 and 2014, respectively. Officials in Multnomah County, home to Portland, said they weren’t planning on opening special cooling centers for now but are monitoring the forecast and can do so if needed. ""This is the first significant event … and it is early for us,"" said Chris Voss, the county’s director of emergency management. ""We’re not seeing a situation where we are hearing that this is extremely dangerous. That being said, we don’t know if it’s going to drift."" Outreach teams have started visiting homeless encampments to let them know about the resources available to them, Voss said. Air-conditioned libraries are an example of a public place where people can cool off, he added.

When storms drop inches of rain into lakes and rivers, water and debris can clog wastewater systems, and service can be disrupted. Drinking water treatment plants are also at potential risk. Notably, water treatment plants are frequently near the water bodies from which they draw, and aging water pipes add to the problem.  While larger cities can fund new projects partially by raising customer rates, smaller communities have to find other funding sources to avoid driving up costs, American Water Works Association manager of energy and environmental policy Adam Carpenter told the Associated Press.  LEAD AND OTHER METAL CONTAMINANTS INCREASE HEART DISEASE RISK, AHA WARNS: 'WE NEED TO DO BETTER' Notably, federal spending packages devote billions to upgrading U.S. water systems.  However, the money is often just a fraction of the cost to address these risks, with other issues – like lead pipes – demanding urgent attention. There are a total of 9.2 million lead pipes across the country, according to a recent report from the Environmental Protection Agency. Research published last year in the journal Nature Climate Change found that population growth and climate change could be drivers of a 26% rise in flood risk in the U.S. by 2050.  The authors said that, just three years ago, the country saw an ""average annual loss"" of $32 billion from flooding but warned that it could rise to $41 billion in 27 years.

The corals should be vibrant and colorful this time of year, but are swiftly going white, said Katey Lesneski, research and monitoring coordinator for Mission: Iconic Reefs, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration launched to protect Florida coral reefs. ""The corals are pale, it looks like the color’s draining out,"" said Lesneski, who has spent several days on the reefs over the last two weeks. ""And some individuals are stark white. And we still have more to come."" Scientists with NOAA this week raised their coral bleaching warning system to Alert Level 2 for the Keys, their highest heat stress level out of five. That level is reached when the average water surface temperature is about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit above the normal maximum for eight straight weeks. Surface temperatures around the Keys have been averaging about 91 degrees, well above the normal mid-July average of 85 degrees, said Jacqueline De La Cour, operations manager for NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch program. Previous Alert Level 2s were reached in August, she said. CLIMATE CHANGE AND POLLUTION COULD ELIMINATE NEARLY ALL CORAL REEFS BY END OF CENTURY Coral reefs are made up of tiny organisms that link together. The reefs get their color from the algae that live inside them and are the corals’ food. When temperatures get too high, the coral expels the algae, making the reefs appear white or bleached. That doesn’t mean they are dead, but the corals can starve and are more susceptible to disease. Andrew Bruckner, research coordinator at the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, said some coral reefs began showing the first signs of bleaching two weeks ago. Then in the last few days, some reefs lost all their color. That had never been recorded before Aug. 1. The peak for bleaching typically happens in late August or September. ""We are at least a month ahead of time, if not two months,"" Bruckner said. ""We’re not yet at the point where we are seeing any mortality ... from bleaching. It is still a minor number that are completely white, certain species, but it is much sooner than we expected."" Still, forecasting what will happen the rest of the summer is hard, De La Cour and Bruckner said. While water temperatures could continue to spike — which could be devastating — a tropical storm or hurricane could churn the water and cool it down. Dusty air from the Sahara Desert moving across the Atlantic and settling over Florida could dampen the sun’s rays, lowering temperatures. Because of climate change and other factors, the Keys waters have lost 80% to 90% of their coral over the last 50 years, Bruckner said. That affects not only marine life that depends on the reefs for survival, but also people — coral reefs are a natural buffer against storm surge from hurricanes and other storms. There is also an economic impact because tourism from fishing, scuba diving and snorkeling is heavily dependent on coral reefs. ""People get in the water, let's fish, let's dive — that's why protecting Florida's coral reef is so critical,"" De La Cour said. Both scientists said it is not ""all doom and gloom."" A 20-year, large-scale effort is underway to rebuild Florida's coral back to about 90% of where it was 50 years ago. Bruckner said scientists are breeding corals that can better withstand the heat and are using simple things like shade covers and underwater fans to cool the water to help them survive. ""We are looking for answers and we are trying to do something, rather than just looking away,"" Bruckner said. Breeding corals can encourage heat resistance in future generations of the animals, said Jason Spadaro, coral reef restoration program manager for Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium in Sarasota, Florida. That could be vital to saving them, he said. Spadaro and others who have visited the corals said they have noticed the coral bleaching is worse in the lower Keys than in the more northern parts of the area. The Keys have experienced bad bleaching years in the past, but this year it is ""really aggressive and it's really persistent,"" he said. US LAWSUIT SEEKS TO PROTECT HABITAT OF ENDANGERED CORALS ""It's going to be a rough year for the reef. It hammers home the need to continue this important work,"" he said. The early bleaching is happening during a year when water temperatures are spiking earlier than normal, said Ross Cunning, a research biologist at Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. The Keys are experiencing water temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, which would normally not occur until August or September, he said. The hot water could lead to a ""disastrous bleaching event"" if it does not wane, Cunning said. ""We're seeing temperatures now that are even higher than what we normally see at peak, which is what makes this particularly scary,"" Cunning said. De La Cour said she has no doubt that the warming waters are caused by human-made global warming and that needs to be fixed for coral to survive.

Coral, for instance, can be deprived of sunlight. As the seaweed decomposes it can release hydrogen sulfide, negatively impact the air and water and causing respiratory problems for people in the surrounding area.  CLIMATE ACTIVISTS, DEMS TURN ON BIDEN OVER LIKELY ALASKAN OIL DRILLING PROJECT: ‘AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT’ ""What we’re seeing in the satellite imagery does not bode well for a clean beach year,"" Brian LaPointe, a research professor at Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute told NBC News.  Brian Barnes, an assistant research professor at the University of South Florida’s College of Marine Science, told the outlet that the sargassum can still threaten critical infrastructure if it remains in coast waters.  ""[I]t can block intake valves for things like power plants or desalination plants. Marinas can get completely inundated and boats can’t navigate through,"" Barnes said.  The impending seaweed comes as Floridians along the state's southwest coast have complained about burning eyes and breathing problems. Dead fish have washed up on beaches. A beachside festival has been canceled, even though it wasn't scheduled for another month. Florida's southwest coast experienced a flare-up of the toxic red tide algae this week, setting off concerns that it could continue to stick around for a while. The current bloom started in October.

The globe's average temperature reached 62.9 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, according to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, a common tool based on satellite data and computer simulations and used by climate scientists for a glimpse of the world’s condition. On Monday, the average temperature was 62.6 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking a record that lasted only 24 hours. ""A record like this is another piece of evidence for the now massively supported proposition that global warming is pushing us into a hotter future,"" said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field, who was not part of the calculations.

https://www.foxnews.com/us/warmer-climate-cuts-short-wolf-study-lake-superior,Warmer-than-usual climate cuts short wolf study near Lake Superior,03/07/2024,"Michigan Tech University biologists have been studying the wolf population on a Lake Superior island every winter since 1958. However, this year's study had to be cut short.","Michigan Tech University biologists have been observing a remote Lake Superior island's fragile wolf population every winter since 1958, but they had to cut this season's planned seven-week survey short after just two weeks. The ski plane they study the wolves from uses the frozen lake as a landing strip because there's nowhere to touch down on the island. But this weirdly warm winter left the Great Lakes nearly devoid of ice. As climate change accelerates, scientists are scrambling to understand how iceless winters could affect the world's largest freshwater system. Most of the effects are still theoretical since the lakes are generally too treacherous for data-gathering expeditions during the coldest months and biologists have long thought that little ecological activity takes place under the ice anyway. But they say the changes could have serious environmental, economic and cultural impacts, including by harming certain fish species, eroding beaches, fueling algae blooms and clogging shipping channels. HISTORIANS RACE TO LOCATE GREAT LAKE SHIPWRECKS BEFORE INVASIVE MUSSELS DESTROY SITES ""This year really drives home the point that we need to collect more data,"" said Trista Vick-Majors, an assistant biology professor who studies aquatic ecosystems at Michigan Tech. ""There's just no way you can predict how an ecosystem is going to respond to the large-scale changes we're looking at."" The planet experienced record heat for an eighth-straight month in January, according to the European climate agency. The upper Midwest has been no exception, with Chicago enjoying temperatures of around 70 degrees (21 degrees Celsius) late last month and Wisconsin getting its first February tornadoes. Ice coverage on the lakes, which have a combined surface area roughly the size of the U.K., has generally peaked in mid-February over the last 50 years, with as much as 91% of the lakes covered at times, according to the Great Lakes Ice Tracker website. As of mid-February this year, only 3% of the lakes was covered, which was the lowest figure since at least 1973, when the site's records begin. Researchers don't have much data about how years of iceless winters could change the lakes, but they have plenty of theories. Iceless lakes could absorb sunlight faster and warm up sooner in the spring. Some biologists speculate that this could lead to earlier and larger blue-green algae blooms, which can be toxic to humans and put a damper on summer tourism. Without ice, the lakes' upper levels will likely warm even more quickly than usual, contributing to thermal stratification, in which layers of colder and warmer water form. Less oxygen would make it into the lower, colder and denser levels, which could cause plankton and other organisms to die, some scientists believe. Whitefish and lake trout typically hatch in the spring and feed on plankton, so less plankton would likely cause fish populations to shrink, potentially leading to tighter fishing quotas and higher prices at grocery stores and restaurants. Less ice could translate to longer fishing seasons, but winter storms could wreck nets and traps and destroy whitefish eggs that rely on the ice for protection, said Titus Seilheimer, a University of Wisconsin-Madison fisheries specialist. Charlie Henrikson runs a small commercial fishing operation off Wisconsin's Door County peninsula. He said his boats have been setting nets in February when they typically don't start the season until late March. He said he's most concerned about the lack of ice leading to more evaporation, which would cause lake levels to drop and make it harder to get his boats into port. ""I'm 71 years old, so I of course like it warmer. I like being able to walk out on the dock here and not have icy conditions. Whatever you want to call it, the weather's changing. And we're getting more extreme conditions. It will change our strategy and we'll be able to figure out ways to make use of it. You always have to adapt."" Less ice also could lead to a longer lake shipping season. But without ice blanketing the lakes, powerful winter storms could erode shorelines more than usual, which could push more sediment into harbors and make them shallower and trickier to navigate, said Eric Peace, vice president of the Lake Carriers Association, a trade group. Coupled with lower lake levels due to increased evaporation, ships might have to carry less cargo so they would sit higher in the water, he said. 'VAMPIRE FISH' IN GREAT LAKES TAKE BITES OUT OF LARGE CATCHES, UNNERVE ANGLERS AS POPULATION CONTROL COMMENCES This year's lack of ice enabled Michigan Tech's Vick-Majors to launch a project to gather winter-specific data that scientists can compare to summer data. Researchers from around the Great Lakes are participating in sampling this month. On a recent day, Madeline Magee and Rae-Ann Eifert, lake monitors for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, braved sub-freezing temperatures to gather buckets of lake water off a Racine breakwater as part of Vick-Majors' project. The lake was completely open, an emerald expanse stretching to the horizon, and the wind was howling. High swells pounded the beach and showered Eifert as she stood on the breakwater, leaving her ski pants coated with beads of ice. Magee said the project is worth it. ""Continuing the data collection moving forward will only further inform what we know about the Great Lakes and how we might be able to manage the lakes more efficiently. ... If we lose ice cover, we really are changing the fundamental ecosystem of the Great Lakes in ways that we don't really understand right now,"" she said."
https://www.foxnews.com/us/wind-solar-projects-flourish-climate-law-nuclear-others-lag-behind,"Wind, solar projects flourish under climate law, while nuclear and others lag behind",04/02/2024,"Under the Biden administration's push to reduce carbon emissions, certain sectors like solar energy have seen a boost, while other trail behind. New regulations prove controversial.","The U.S. has doubled the pace of cutting carbon emissions since President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in 2022, analysts and scientists said, with more than 80 solar, wind and energy storage projects taking advantage of the law's mix of direct payments and tax credits. The IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law last year provided $239 billion for clean energy, electric vehicles (EVs), electrification of buildings, and carbon management in the U.S., up 38% from 2022, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the policy researcher Rhodium Group and MIT. Still, experts said there is a long way to go before the law can achieve Biden's wider climate ambitions of net-zero by 2050. Ultimately, analysts expect U.S. government direct spending and tax credits under the law will far exceed the initial $400 billion estimate. Goldman Sachs Group has projected up to $1.2 trillion spending through 2031. MULTIPLE OBSTACLES IMPEDE THE UN'S GOAL TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE ENERGY BY 2030 Two years after passage of the landmark climate law, early winners have been sectors such as electrical power, battery manufacturing and traditional clean energies like wind and solar. The law encouraged Asian and European companies to invest more in the U.S., which in turn prompted Europe to develop its own Green Industrial Plan over worries the U.S. would pull away clean-energy projects and talent. Still, state and local regulations have hindered development of new transmission lines, and new EV charging stations have not sprouted up as quickly as some had hoped. Also, the IRA has been much slower to encourage other types of projects, especially hydrogen, carbon sequestration, geothermal and nuclear energy, noted Jigar Shah, head of the loan programs office at the Department of Energy. Those sectors ""continue to struggle around figuring out how exactly to put all the pieces together,"" Shah said last month at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. Oil companies have bristled at the criteria for tax credits for hydrogen fuel plants. Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Darren Woods warned in an interview that he might scrap a multibillion-dollar plan to build the world's largest hydrogen plant in Texas. ""The challenge has been translating the legislation of the IRA into regulation,"" Woods said, noting the proposed regulation favors hydrogen fuel from plants powered by renewable energy rather than natural gas. BIDEN'S EPA FINALIZES STRICT TRUCK EMISSION RULES Even in sectors like electric vehicles, companies are discovering ""a host of practical barriers to putting the IRA tax breaks to work"", said Jason Bordoff, founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. For instance, he cited a lack of transmission lines that would connect new clean energy projects to the grid and local-content requirements for EVs. Concern about Asian companies cornering the market on advanced technology needed for EVs and other green energy items also prompted Washington to launch aggressive investments in semiconductor plants. ""Some parts of clean energy like electric vehicles have become particularly politicized. There could be a risk that the implementation of the IRA by the administration could be slowed down,"" Bordoff said. Tax breaks for EV purchases under the law have U.S. automakers worried about cheap Chinese vehicles flooding the market, triggering rules for U.S. content and calls in Washington for steeper tariffs. China has protested U.S. content rules on EVs to the World Trade Organization. So far, a $7.5 billion U.S.-funded network of electric vehicle charging stations has led to only a handful of stations despite a temporary waiver of U.S. content rules. Regulatory hurdles have hindered advancement of complex projects favored by oil companies such as hydrogen plants or carbon capture systems for oil wells, noted Roman Kramarchuk, head of climate markets and policy analytics for S&P Global Commodity Insights. He predicted these projects would see a second wave of development ""when there is more certainty around how that financing is supposed to happen or what it takes to get a deal done."" Oil executives at the conference in Houston also complained that regulations were making it difficult to build new natural gas pipelines, which undercut efforts to remove the gas from drilling sites. Despite the various industry complaints, the climate law has helped the U.S. reduce carbon emissions by 4% annually, double the pace of 2% a year before the law, nine research teams across the U.S. said last year in an article published in the journal Science. Still, some experts said the pace must accelerate. ""The IRA doubles the pace of reductions but should have tripled it to hit our 2030 climate goals and get on the path to net-zero by 2050,"" said Princeton Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering professor Jesse Jenkins, one of the study participants.

Here is a retrospective look at some of the deadliest disasters in the U.S. and across the world.","In 2023, the world witnessed a series of major disasters that caused widespread destruction, tearing up homes and communities, and in many cases, taking lives.  Here is a retrospective — but not exhaustive — look at some of 2023’s biggest natural disasters in the United States and around the world.  TURKEY-SYRIA EARTHQUAKE – FEB. 6, 2023  A massive rainstorm overwhelmed two dams in Libya and sent water rushing down to the eastern city of Derna. Entire neighborhoods full of people were washed into the sea.  The shaking toppled thousands of buildings and heaped more misery on a region wracked by Syria’s 12-year civil war and refugee crisis. Many blamed lax building codes in Turkey, as well as a slow government response there, for exacerbating the crisis.  MOROCCO EARTHQUAKE – SEPT. 8, 2023  Many blamed the country’s inability to respond to the disaster on a government that’s been divided for the past decade. Rival administrations are backed by international patrons and armed militias whose influence in the country has ballooned since a NATO-backed Arab Spring uprising toppled autocratic ruler Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.  In early February, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Syria and Turkey, followed by a series of powerful aftershocks that lasted for days. The United Nations later estimated that the temblors killed around 50,000 people — the vast majority of whom were in Turkey.  LIBYA FLOODS – SEPT. 4-12, 2023 A 6.8 earthquake struck Morocco’s Atlas Mountains in early September, killing an estimated 2,900 people. The region’s mud-brick homes left those trapped underneath with little air and hindered rescue operations.  HAWAII FIRE WILDFIRES – AUG. 8-11, 2023 A wildfire tore through the Hawaiian island of Maui in early August, reducing much of the historic town of Lahaina to ash and forcing people to jump into the ocean to flee the flames. Approximately 100 people were killed.  This month, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said he was requesting $425 million from lawmakers during the next fiscal year to help Maui recover from the wildfires.  HURRICANE IDALIA – AUG. 26-31, 2023 The year saw 20 storms in the Atlantic basin — the fourth-highest total since 1950. Seven of these became hurricanes, and three intensified into major hurricanes.  The most powerful of these was Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane along the Florida Gulf Coast and produced more than 80% of the season’s damage.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ophelia affected the U.S. East Coast all the way up to New England.

The activists also allegedly spray-painted the case with ""This is Rigged,"" the name of their protest group, The Scotsman reported.  MANCHIN TANKS BIDEN NOMINEE OVER CLIMATE ACTIVISM A post on Instagram, which includes pictures of the suspects allegedly vandalizing the display case, said the group’s intent was to ""continue in civil resistance until our demands are met."" ""We demand the Scottish Government vocally oppose all new fossil fuel projects in Scotland and creates a clear transition plan for oil workers,"" the group wrote.  The Crown court did not oppose bail for the activists, but it did seek to ban them from entering the city of Stirling, where the Wallace monument is located, except to attend court dates.  BIDEN'S BUDGET TAKES AIM AT FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY WITH TAX HIKES Alexander Cloudley, 29 and Katrielle Chan, 21, both from Glasgow, pleaded not guilty to vandalism in Stirling Sheriff Court last week. They allegedly damaged and spray-painted the case holding Wallace of ""Braveheart"" fame’s sword.  Cloudley and Chan were arrested on site, but Police Scotland said ""inquiries are ongoing"" into the incident.  In a video posted to the group’s page, Chan read a statement after spray-painting the display case, saying, ""One hundred and eleven years ago, suffragettes stood in this very spot to stand up for their rights and freedom, 600 years before William Wallace defended our freedom with this very sword. Now it is time for us to stand up for our rights too."" The sword on display in his monument is one he allegedly wielded during the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297 and the Battle of Falkirk in 1298, according to Artnet News. The story inspired Mel Gibson to make the Academy Award-winning movie ""Braveheart,"" which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1996.  Wallace defied the English at a time when Scotland remained subject to its southern neighbor, helping wage the Scottish War of Independence that ultimately resulted in Scotland breaking away — for a time — from English governance.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Climate protests in Britain have targeted a number of culturally significant artifacts and pieces, including a famous incident last year in which anti-oil environmentalists poured tomato soup on Vincent van Gogh’s ""Sunflowers"" painting at London’s National Gallery.  Protesters from ""Just Stop Oil"" also glued themselves to the frame of a famous John Constable painting hanging in Britain’s National Gallery in June. "
https://www.foxnews.com/world/african-countries-consider-swapping-debt-invest-climate-action-meeting-ethiopia,African countries consider swapping debt to invest in climate action at meeting in Ethiopia,03-21-2023,Finance ministers of different African countries met in Ethiopia's capital to discuss the continents debt. The ministers are considering swapping debt to invest in climate action.,"African countries saddled with debt and ravaged by losses and damages from weather events like cyclones, drought and extreme temperatures have agreed to consider swapping debt to invest in climate action in a meeting of finance ministers in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. The ""debt-for-climate swap"" option is an economic tool that allows a country’s debt to be reduced in exchange for commitments on green investments. It was among several alternative green financing models discussed at the ongoing United Nations conference for finance and economic ministers that supporters say would boost funds to adapt to climate harms, protect nature and finance local communities. It comes as many African nations are battling with the effects of costly climate change-fueled events like the ongoing drought in eastern Africa that has killed thousands and decimated livelihoods reliant on rain-fed agriculture and the aftermath of the devastating Cyclone Freddy in the south that's left hundreds dead and thousands of others displaced. 2 KIDNAPPED INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS STAFF MEMBERS FREED IN MALI Egyptian finance minister Mohamed Maait said that his country is one of many that is now having to add heavy climate costs to budgets stretched thin by external debt — which takes up to 17% of countries' spending in some cases — and other basic needs. ""What am asking every day and every hour is where do I get the money to protect our people from climate extremes,"" Maait said, adding that borrowing was often the only option for some nations. Yet ""many countries simply cannot access international financial markets because of rising interest rates,"" Hanan Morsy, the chief economist of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa told the roundtable Monday evening. Morsy added that private sector investments in climate finance are lower in Africa than in any other part of the world. MOZAMBIQUE RECORDS INCREASE IN CHOLERA CASES, MALAWI SEES DECLINE AS COUNTRIES RECOVER FROM CYCLONE FREDDY Ministers also discussed bonds that would help increase private financial flows as well as ""blended finance"" models that would combine development funds and private capital as potential solutions for climate funding. Interest in green finance has been growing, along with criticism that current mechanisms don't work for countries ravaged by climate extremes but have contributed little to the planet-warming emissions in the atmosphere. In 2022 the International Monetary Fund established a $50 billion climate loan pot to help low and middle-income nations access affordable and longer-term financing to respond to shocks associated with climate change. Rwanda became the first African nation to receive a loan of $319 million. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But another $50 billion pot pledged by the World Bank is only sending around 5% of its funds to the ten most climate vulnerable countries, according to a recent study by the Center for Global Development. Four of the ten nations identified — Mali, Niger, Sudan and Liberia — were in Africa. The ministers' roundtable coincided with the Green Climate Fund board meeting, a group within the U.N. climate agency that financially supports nations to adapt to or curb climate change. On Monday the fund approved $580 million in new climate finance for developing nations."

One resident, a local nature photographer, told The Associated Press he ""nearly had to put a mask on."" ""I was worried about my own health. That water right in the top comes down to our pumping station for the town. People north of Menindee say there's cod and perch floating down the river everywhere,"" he said.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/brazil-builds-carbon-dioxide-emitting-towers-amazon-simulate-climate-change,Brazil builds carbon dioxide emitting towers in Amazon to simulate climate change,05-24-2023,Brazil is building a complex of carbon dioxide-emitting towers in the Amazon to simulate climate change. The technology was developed in a New York lab.,"In the depths of the Amazon, Brazil is building an otherworldly structure — a complex of towers arrayed in six rings, poised to spray mists of carbon dioxide into the rainforest. But the reason is utterly terrestrial: to understand how the world’s largest tropical forest responds to climate change. Dubbed AmazonFACE, the project will probe the forest’s remarkable ability to sequester carbon dioxide — an essential piece in the puzzle of world climate change. This will help scientists understand whether the region has a tipping point that could throw it into a state of irreversible decline. Such a feared event, also known as the Amazon forest dieback, would transform the world’s most biodiverse forest into a drier savannah-like landscape. FACE stands for Free Air CO2 Enrichment. This technology first developed by Brookhaven National Laboratory, located near New York City, has the ability to modify the surrounding environment of growing plants in a way that replicates future levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. ""Plants absorb carbon dioxide along with water and light to produce sugars and release oxygen. What happens when one increases this input? We don’t know,"" David Lapola, one of the leading scientists of the project, told The Associated Press. ""We have evidence from similar experiments in temperate forests, but there is no guarantee that the behavior will be the same here in the Amazon."" BRAZILIAN ECOLOGISTS COMBAT AMAZON DEFORESTATION WITH NEW LAND OWNERSHIP MODEL Lapola, a professor at the State University of Campinas, argues that the tipping point of the Amazon rainforest is more likely tied to climate change rather than the rate of deforestation. Thus, it is crucial to study the impact of higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the forest to understand what lies ahead. This perspective challenges the widely quoted study by Earth system scientist Carlos Nobre. According to Nobre, if deforestation reaches a critical threshold of 20% to 25% across the Amazon, the balance of the region’s rainfall system will be disrupted, leading to the transformation of the lush rainforest into a savannah. ""Even if we halted deforestation in the Amazon basin today, the forest would still be at risk of experiencing the consequences of a tipping point due to climate change,"" Lapola said. ""While stopping deforestation remains our primary responsibility, combating the climate change driven by atmospheric factors is not something that Brazil or other Amazonian countries can address alone."" DEFORESTATION IN BRAZIL INCREASED 30% IN 12 MONTHS, AGENCY SAYS The construction of the initial two rings is underway and they are expected to be operational by early August. Each ring will consist of 16 aluminum towers as high as a 12-story building. The carbon dioxide will be supplied by three companies to avoid any shortage. Situated 44 miles north of Manaus, the project is led by the National Institute for Amazon Research, a federal institution, with financial support from the British government, which has pledged $9 million. It should be fully operational by mid-2024. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Luciana Gatti, an atmospheric chemist, praised the initiative and said it would be highly beneficial to replicate the project in the four quadrants of the Amazon, as the carbon absorption capacity varies significantly across the region, which is twice the size of India. Gatti, who is not directly involved with AmazonFACE, coauthored a landmark study published in the journal Nature, which revealed that the eastern Amazon has ceased to function as a carbon sink, or absorber for the Earth and has transitioned into a carbon source."

The group wants the German government to do more to curb global warming.,"Climate activists said Tuesday that they will stage further protests in Berlin in an effort to force the German government into doing more to curb global warming. The announcement came as courts are taking a tougher stance against members of the group Last Generation who have repeatedly blocked roads across Germany in the past year. The group said at a news conference in Berlin that it would begin to stage open-ended protests Wednesday in the government district. From Monday onward, members will try to ""peacefully bring the city to a standstill,"" it said. GERMANY SHUTTING DOWN LAST 3 NUCLEAR PLANTS, RELYING ON COAL, NATURAL GAS DURING 'CLEAN' ENERGY PUSH Last Generation accuses the German government of breaching the country’s constitution, citing a supreme court verdict two years ago that found too much of the burden for climate change was being placed on younger generations. The government under then Chancellor Angela Merkel subsequently raised its targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, but activists say the measures aren't consistent with the Paris climate accord. ""As long as there’s no plan we can trust to protect our lives and future, and that’s based on the constitution, we are obliged to demand such a plan with all peaceful means,"" said Carla Hinrichs, a spokesperson for Last Generation. GERMAN COMPANY TO INVEST $300M IN PENNSYLVANIA CHIPMAKING PLANT The group wants Germany to end the use of all fossil fuels by 2030, a step that would be extremely ambitious to achieve.

""The Biden administration and frankly, too many policymakers in Washington, D.C., continue to see China as a partner,"" Chuck DeVore, the chief national initiatives officer at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, told Fox News.

""I find [it] utterly remarkable that Chairman Xi [Jinping] of China and the Chinese Communist Party gives a tinker's damn about the planet's climate or climate change,"" DeVore continued.

But that same year, the country began building over half of the world’s new coal-based power plants, all within China, according to The Wilson Center. Since the country doesn't have any other significant energy sources, China's reliance on coal allows Beijing to avoid depending on foreign sources, DeVore told Fox News. That also means China's recent increased investment in coal-powered industries helps protect its energy independence in case of conflict. ""It's not at all about green energy,"" Devore said. ""It's about making the Chinese economy resilient in the event of a conflict with America."" China hit a coal production record in November — the same month President Biden and Xi discussed climate goals — and 2023 production is expected to expand further, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics.

""Those electric vehicles in China are coal-fired cars. That's where the energy comes from to charge the cars in China. Coal, Chinese coal.""  ""If you thought that carbon dioxide emissions were a problem and the planet was warming, then you'd have to ask yourself, ‘why is it that the Chinese are converting so much of their coal into fuel right now,'"" DeVore added. China has been increasing investment in its coal-to-liquids industry, which enables coal to be turned into cheap fuel for pedestrian and military use, according to DeVore. But that process makes more carbon dioxide emissions than traditional oil refining methods. WHAT IS THE NATIONAL POWER GRID AND HOW RESILIENT IS IT? Other Chinese green energy products have also sparked concerns from federal agencies.  Regardless, climate change should not be the priority of U.S.-Chinese foreign policy, according to DeVore.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized shipments of Chinese-made solar equipment last year because the products were from Xinjiang, where the U.S. has banned purchases over concerns of slave labor.

The member states were supposed to give final approval to the bill on Monday following months of proceedings through the EU’s institutional maze. But what was supposed to be a mere rubber stamp has now been possibly shelved forever. ""(The plan) is in a very difficult position at the moment and with the upcoming European elections, it won’t be easy to get out of this position,"" said Dutch Climate Minister Rob Jetten. The Nature Restoration plan is a key part of the EU’s European Green Deal that seeks to establish the world’s most ambitious climate and biodiversity targets and make the bloc the global point of reference on all climate issues. EU AGRICULTURE MINISTERS MEET TO DISCUSS WIDESPREAD EUROPEAN FARMER PROTESTS The bill aims for Europe to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, demanding short-term changes and sacrifices from all parts of society to reap the benefits in a generation. ""If you want to reach climate neutrality, you also have to look in the broader perspective of protecting biodiversity, strengthening the nature in Europe,"" Jetten said, stressing that such initiatives were necessary. Even if the plan had a rough ride through the EU’s complicated approval process, the watered-down version was supposed to sail through the final vote. FARMER PROTESTS LEAD EU TO GIVE UP PROPOSED PESTICIDE CUT Under the complicated voting rules, whereby a qualified majority representing 15 of the 27 member states and 65 % of the population was needed, it was long thought that threshold was safe, until Monday. ""It seems that we don't have a qualified majority anymore because ... Hungary has changed its vote. We have to understand why they do that,"" said Alain Maron, a Belgian regional climate minister, who chaired the meeting of the EU environment ministers. The change of heart follows weeks of relentless protests from farmers across the bloc who have argued that reams of environmental laws governing the way they work are driving them toward bankruptcy at a time when food security and self-sufficiency are becoming essential again as the Russian war on Ukraine war rages on. ""It is very important to keep flexibility for member states,"" said Aniko Raisz, Hungary's environmental minister, on Monday. When asked if her country could change its position again, Raisz said she ""can't promise anything,"" while stressing the importance of the agricultural sector across Europe. ""We have to be realistic and we have to keep in mind all these sectors,"" she said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Monday’s postponement was the EU’s latest concession in reaction to protests that have affected the daily lives of tens of millions of EU citizens and cost businesses tens of millions of euros due to transportation delays. Others have included shelving legislation on tighter pesticide rules, loosening checks and controls on farms, and requirements to let some land lie fallow. Under the plan, member states would have to meet restoration targets for specific habitats and species, to cover at least 20% of the region’s land and sea areas by 2030. But quarrels over exemptions and flexibility clauses allowing members to skirt the rules plagued negotiations. Last month, the bill was adopted in Parliament by a 329-275 vote with 24 abstentions after the center-right Christian Democratic European People’s Party decided to vote against it. Environmentalists and the Greens group were in rapture, thinking it was the last stumbling block. Despite the droughts, floods and heat waves that have swept through many areas in Europe, the postponement of any vote signals a possible pause on such environmental actions to protect economic competitiveness."

Protestors converged on the E.U. parliament ahead of the vote.,"Protesters and legislators converged on the European Union parliament Tuesday as the bloc prepared a cliffhanger vote on protecting its threatened nature and shielding it from disruptive environmental change, in a test of the EU's global climate credentials. Spurred on by climate activist Greta Thunberg, a few hundred demonstrators demanded that the EU pushes through a bill to beef up the restoration of nature in the 27-nation bloc that was damaged during decades of industrial expansion. A counterdemonstration of farmers demanded a slower approach that would lessen the impact on their income. Inside the legislature in Strasbourg, France, parliamentarians put in last-minute efforts to sway Wednesday’s vote, which could push a key part of the EU's biodiversity protection plans off the table. The legislature’s environment committee last month was deadlocked at 44-44 on it. The bill is a key part of the EU’s vaunted European Green Deal that seeks to establish the world's most ambitious climate and biodiversity targets and make the bloc the global point of reference on all climate issues. The plans proposed by the EU’s executive commission set binding restoration targets for specific habitats and species, with the aim by 2030 to cover at least 20% of the region’s land and sea areas. EU SEES NO 'CRITICAL AREAS OF CONCERN' IN USE OF HERBICIDE SLAMMED BY ENVIRONMENTALISTS ""This is really a crunch moment, not only for Green Deal, but also whether Europe stands by its word,"" said Greens leader Terry Reintke. ""Are we the ones that are talking and telling us what to do but not doing it ourselves?"" The EU’s executive commission wants the nature restoration law to be a key part of the system since it is necessary for the overall deal to have the maximum impact. Others say that if the EU fails on the nature restoration law, it would indicate an overall fatigue on climate issues. The bill long looked like a shoo-in as it gathered widespread support in member nations and was staunchly defended by the EU's executive commission and its president Ursula von der Leyen. But von der Leyen's own political group, the Christian Democrat European People's Party, turned sour on it and now vehemently opposes it, claiming it will affect food security and undermine the income of farmers and disgruntle a European population focused more on jobs and their wallets. Like some nations and leaders, they want to hit pause such far-reaching climate legislation. ""For the next five years we have to care a lot about our industrial base. You have to care a lot about competitiveness in the European Union. So we have to manage the big changes needed in a way that we don’t lose economic power,"" said EPP chief Manfred Weber. EUROPEAN UNION TO LOOK INTO BLOCKING SUN'S RAYS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE: REPORT As the largest group, with 177 seats in the 705-seat legislature, its opposition has been key in turning the issue into a hot political debate. And on Tuesday few ventured to predict which way the vote would go. The member states have already agreed by a large majority to back a slightly more flexible version of the bill. If parliament backs the plan on Wednesday both institutions would sit down to broker a final layout in the second half of the year. The commission has said there is no reason to reject the plan now as too rigid, since there is still time for compromises on many of the issues. EU Environment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius said the commission would show ""openness to revisit and improve certain provisions and to enhance clarity, making sure the proposal reflects the current reality."" If parliament rejects the plan Wednesday, it would be sent back to the drawing board and it's unlikely anything would emerge ahead of the June EU parliament elections next year. And that would undermine the EU's credibility abroad since it has put so much into its vaunted Green Deal.

Congo's calls were dismissed on a legal technicality. The country is sending a reduced delegation to Gabon.

The Oct. 31 incident in Berlin fueled controversy over the tactics of the Last Generation group, whose actions also have included throwing mashed potatoes at a Claude Monet painting in an art museum and disrupting traffic at airports. Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged activists to show ""creativity"" and avoid endangering others. They found that the blockade did cause an eight-minute delay to the arrival of a rescue vehicle. But they said that wasn't significant to the cyclist's fate as a doctor had already determined that using the vehicle's equipment likely would have worsened the victim's condition further and another course of action made more sense.

https://www.foxnews.com/world/indigenous-communities-argentina-chile-grapple-soaring-demand-lithium,Indigenous communities in Argentina and Chile grapple with soaring demand for lithium,03-13-2024,"The prevalence of lithium mining is threatening to disrupt traditional ways of life for indigenous groups living in a region spanning Argentina, Chile and Bolivia.","Irene Leonor Flores de Callata, 68, treks along a bone-dry riverbed, guiding a herd of llamas and sheep through stretching desert. Flores de Callata’s native Kolla people have spent centuries climbing deep into the mountains of northern Argentina in search of a simple substance: Fresh drinking water. Here, in one of the most arid environments in the world, it’s a life force that underpins everything. US, CANADA AND INDIGENOUS GROUPS ANNOUNCE PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS CROSS-BORDER MINING POLLUTION In rainy months, the sacred lands surrounding their small adobe town of Tusaquillas well with water. In the dry months, families hike miles under the beating sun, hopeful their livestock can sip from a small plastic container, fed by a hose running high into the distant mountains. Today is a lucky day. Their blue container is brimming with fresh water. But communities like hers increasingly worry that their luck may run out. That’s because the parched waterways surrounding their town are intrinsically connected with spanning white salt flats below, subterranean lagoons with waters jam-packed with a material that’s come to be known as ""white gold"" – lithium. In the ""lithium triangle"" – a region spanning Argentina, Chile and Bolivia – native communities sit upon a treasure trove of the stuff: an estimated trillion dollars in lithium. The metal is key in the global fight against climate change, used in electric car batteries, crucial to solar and wind energy and more. But to extract it, mines suck water out of the flats, tethered to the lives of thousands of communities like Flores de Callata’s. As the world’s most powerful increasingly look toward the Triangle, the largest reserve of lithium on Earth, as a crucial puzzle piece to save the environment, others worry the search for the mineral will mean sacrificing that very life force that has sustained the region’s native people for centuries. ""We will lose everything,"" said Flores de Callata. ""What will we do if we don’t have water? If the mines come, we’ll lose our culture, we won’t be left with anything."" At the same time Flores de Callata’s town and thousands of others across the ""lithium triangle"" have lived quietly off the sparse food and water their lands offer, the price for lithium skyrocketed in 2022. Between 2021 and 2023, the price for one ton of lithium in U.S. markets nearly tripled, reaching a high of $46,000 a ton last year, according to a United States Geological Survey report. In China, the main customer of the region’s lithium, a ton of the metal went for a whopping $76,000 at its peak last year. Leaders, mining executives and companies from across the world began to turn their heads. From the U.S. and China, they looked to the region’s barren deserts both as a source of wealth and an engine to power the transition to green energy. U.S., President Joe Biden has pushed for a shift to more sustainable energy sources, like wind and solar, and aimed to have half of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. – around 8 million cars a year – be electric by 2030. All require lithium. In late February, Biden's top diplomat Antony Blinken underscored the importance Argentina's lithium in a visit to the South American country. ""One of the most important to our shared future – in fact, one of the most important to the entire planet – is clean energy,"" Blinken said. ""Argentina is poised to play a critical role in building supply chains for critical minerals that will drive the economy of the 21st century, particularly things like lithium."" The high demand surged global lithium production, but in recent months prices have significantly dipped due to a short-term oversupply in the metal and overestimates in electric vehicle purchases. Yet global consumption of the lithium only continues to rise. The ""white gold"" they seek is contained in the hundreds of salt flats, or salares, speckling the region. From afar, they look like fields of Arctic snow, but below are deep wells of salted groundwater packed with minerals. Unlike other forms of mining, lithium here is extracted not from rock, but rather from the brine water pumped from the salt flats. The problem is that the salt flats also act as an essential part of a highly biodiverse ecosystem, say scientists like Ingrid Garcés, a hydrologist from Chile’s University of Antofagasta. 10-YEAR LEGAL BATTLE RAGES BETWEEN NATIVE AMERICANS AND MINING INTERESTS OVER SACRED LAND ATOP COPPER DEPOSIT While the water inside the lagoons is not drinkable, they are tethered to surrounding fresh water sources, sparse rains and nearby mountain streams, essential for the survival of thousands of indigenous communities. The concern by scientists interviewed by the AP is that industrial-scale water pumping both contaminates fresh water with brine they pump and effectively dries up the surrounding environment. They say it’s produced cascading ripple effects for life in the region at a time it’s already been hit by climate change-induced drought. ""We’re talking about a living ecosystem, because what you’re extracting from this salt flat is water. And water is life,"" Garcés said. ""Think of it as an interconnected ecosystem."" Because of their environmental significance, the salt flats and their surrounding waters have gained a sacred place for Indigenous cultures, an essential part of native celebrations the entire month of August. Flores de Callata’s town is one of 38 pressed up against two such salt flats – the Guayatayoc lagoon and Salinas Grandes – which bring income to towns like hers through tourism and small-scale salt harvesting. At the beginning of any day of work, Flores de Callata’s family makes an offering to Pachamama, an Andean deity representing the Earth. Inside their stone corral of llamas and sheep, they dig a hole in the ground, burying coca leaves, meant to represent life, and a clear liquor, representing water. Just as the basin provided for the Kolla people, fundamental to their culture is giving back to the land. For decades, their collective of communities have fought off large-scale mining and waged long legal battles to halt projects. But year by year, it’s grown more difficult to fend off those mining companies. More than 30 companies are officially seeking permission to mine the water in the two salt flats. Signs put up by the community line the edges of the flats reading, ""Respect our territory. Get out, lithium company."" ""We are guardians of the highlands,"" said Flores de Callata. ""We defend our land. … I’m worried not just for myself but for all of us. If the lithium (mines) come it’s going to affect the entire region, all of the waterways by extension."" Things came to a head last summer when the local government, eager for the profits by the mines, changed its constitution, making it easier to waive certain indigenous land rights and limiting the ability to protest against the expansion of mining. Alicia Chalabe, the environmental lawyer representing the communities, and others argue the move violates international law. Thousands of indigenous people erupted in protest, blocking off roadways used by lithium mines and carrying rainbow indigenous flags. The backlash by authorities toward peaceful protesters was marked by violent repression and arbitrary arrests, according to groups like Amnesty International and the United Nations. Yet protests are only expected to continue. ""This is a domestic conflict that is set in the context of a global issue, where there’s a tremendous pressure to exploit lithium for electric vehicles,"" Chalabe said. ""It’s global because of the importance lithium has for the world, but at the same time, so is the resistance of these communities. They’re not alone."" Argentine concerns are born in neighboring Chile, where lithium mining has been in full force for decades in the Atacama Desert, the driest place on Earth. Giant black tubes pumping salted groundwater run like veins through the cracked, white earth of the Atacama Salt Flat. They wind past roaring yellow bulldozers and workers in bright orange vests. The flat is home to the two lithium companies operating in Chile, SQM and American-owned Albemarle. ""We’re living through a crisis in which we have big obstacles, but we also have solutions. Lithium represents one of those solutions,"" said Valentín Barrera, a spokesperson for Chile’s largest lithium mine, SQM. ""We want to grow, understanding that it’s needed to mitigate climate change."" Here in the SQM mine, that means pumping at least 1,280 liters of salted groundwater a second – somewhere between 6 to 8 bathtubs – according to the mine’s numbers. The tubes converge at rows of blue, green and yellow pools, where lithium-concentrated water is passed from pool-to-pool. The harsh desert sun evaporates the water, and strong winds often blow it out of the ecosystem, carried as far as Brazil, one mine official said. Because of the evaporation process and harsh winds, hardly any water can be reinjected into the soil. It leaves behind salt and lithium, to be processed and used by some of the world’s biggest companies like Tesla. Meanwhile, surrounding communities have watched their lands shrivel. Farmers like 62-year-old Orlando Morales living near the mines complain of smaller crop yields. Flamingos, feeding on microorganisms within the brine, have slowly been killed off by mining, a 2022 study showed. Their eggs were once a crucial part of the local diet, and the birds continue to be a big part of indigenous celebrations. Meanwhile, wells and lagoons next to the mines brimming with intense blue fresh water dried up. The grass Morales’ livestock would once eat has vanished, he said. An investigation in 2016 found SQM extracted more groundwater than legally permitted for consecutive years, something authorities said ""put the stability of the ecosystem in extreme risk."" SQM later accused its neighbor of doing the same. In 2022, SQM was ordered to pay $51.7 million to correct the damages caused by six infractions, including transparency concerns and contamination of fresh water wells. ""Before, it rained more here, and today it practically doesn’t rain. If you look out, it’s all dry. So it’s hard to care for your sheep, your llamas because there’s no vegetation,"" Morales said as his wife tended to a patch of corn. ""Our people are losing our traditions, our customs are being lost."" ""With the information we have available, we can say there has been no fundamental change in the surroundings (of the mines),"" he said. In 2013, an environmental inspection found that a third of the carob trees – a plant known to survive in harsh environments – near the SQM mine had died. Many more trees were withering. At Albemarle, the other mine occupying the flat, one spokesperson insisted that the brine water they pump ""is not water"" because it is not drinkable. Nearly a dozen scientists that spoke to The Associated Press said it is almost inconceivable that the heavy water use would have no environmental impact. He attributed court rulings and criticisms to ""disinformation,"" and cast blame on state-run copper mines, also heavy water users. The mine’s director later said that the water the lithium mines pump is slowly refilled by rain and fresh water in the mountains, a water source for local communities. ""The Earth is warming, and you are evaporating more water in a shorter amount of time,"" she said. ""Through this industry you are accelerating water loss."" Lithium mining has also sparked an economic boom in parts of Chile. Since the beginning of the native Atacama people, generations of Ramon Torres’ family guided their pack of goats along the rolling hills of Peine, a town sitting at the mouth of Chile’s salt flats. Like in Argentina, the mining spurred on waves of criticisms and court battles as locals demand to have a voice on the fate of their lands. Garcés, the Chilean hydrologist, added that the extraction may even speed up the effects of climate change. SQM spokesperson Barrera, would not directly respond when asked if they can say definitively that they haven’t damaged the environment. When companies started extracting lithium in the early 1980s, Ramon Torres was among the people to raise his hand. He worked the tinted pools, going from subsisting like his parents and grandparents to saving. Today, he sits on the porch of his small brick house scrolling through his smartphone, both purchased with the money he earned from the mine. Cherry-red trucks loaded with miners rumble past his home on their way to a long day of work as the sun rises in the morning. ""There is development, but there’s also the water issue. And they contradict each other,"" he said. ""Because everyone needs money, everyone also needs the basics, like healthcare and education."" That same tension has divided mining towns like his in both Chile and Argentina: The economic benefits of lithium are undeniable. Mining makes up a whopping 62% of Chile’s exports, a crucial backbone to the country’s economy. The money that the mines have brought has rippled across Peine. Torres now works building homes for and rents to mine workers that have flooded the region. Companies advertise investment projects in nearby towns, touting mobile dental clinics and soccer fields, in many ways filling the endemic absence of the Chilean government. While brush and other greenery in the surrounding lands withered long ago, fresh water still arrives in Peine through artificial channels and water centers built by the companies, flowing from fresh water wells in nearby peaks. Communities higher in the mountains say they now feel the effects, too, but without the perks from the companies. Meanwhile, legal clashes with the mining companies have sowed tensions in indigenous communities. Long-held traditions like ranching and shared community work have faded. Younger Atacameño generations leave their towns, often favoring work in the mining sector, leaving indigenous communities with smaller populations. A 2020 report by the UN, said that mining has consumed 65% of water around the Atacama Salt Flat, ""causing groundwater depletion, soil contamination and other forms of environmental degradation, forcing local communities to abandon ancestral settlements."" As lithium mining has gained a greater global spotlight, the fate of water in the region has increasingly fallen out of the hands of those communities. In April last year, progressive Chilean President Gabriel Boric announced a plan aimed at offsetting the environmental impacts of the lithium sector by boosting government control of the lithium mines. Researchers say that the worst effects of current pumping may only be felt years down the line. The move also had an adverse effect of pushing mining companies to invest in neighboring Argentina, where lithium mining’s explosion has just begun. Government officials told the AP a new plan would allow them to better regulate water use and distribute wealth beyond ""just a small few."" But plans spurred outrage among indigenous communities who said they were once again sidelined by government negotiations with the mines. ""In the end, in the future, when this ‘lithium boom’ ends, the problem is: When the mines leave, what’s going to happen to us?"" Torres said. ""Mining is all we have left."" The chainsaw-wielding leader has announced a broad deregulation sweep, slashing costs for mining companies in an effort to lure investors amid deepening economic crisis. Milei’s rise to power will likely further hamstring already fraught efforts by indigenous communities to beat back mining companies. Doors for the mining companies have also been left wide open under the country’s new right-wing ""anarcho-capitalist"" leader Javier Milei, who was elected in November, under a promise to fix his country’s spiraling economy. Meanwhile, the region has also increasingly become part of a larger tug-of-war between global powers like the U.S. and China as both countries seek to take advantage of the deep lithium stores. The Biden administration has also sought to offset growing Chinese influence in the region, with officials even claiming Chinese investment in the lithium sector is a democratic threat. Meanwhile, Irene Leonor Flores de Callata and her small town of Tusaquillas, the mounting interest in their home represents another nightmare scenario. While nearby Bolivia sits on more lithium than either of the countries, its stores have largely remained untapped. ""In Argentina, (Chile’s decision) is an opportunity,"" Miguel Soler, secretary of mining in Jujuy in northern Argentina, said. NEW FEDERAL POLICY GIVES NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES POWER TO VETO GREEN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT She looks at her small corral of livestock she has spent decades leading to through the desert. She wonders what will be left in 20 years. She looks at the stretching salt flats, and the water that has breathed life into their barren land. And Flores de Callata looks at the adobe house she and her husband built from nothing, where her grandchildren now wrap their arms around her on the way home from school. ""If the mines come, we’ll have money for a time. But then our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren – they’re the ones who will suffer,"" she said. ""I want to do everything possible to defend these lands, so they still have these fields, so they still have their waters."""

But right now, the post-pandemic global economy is throwing up obstacles that will need to be overcome if the goal is going to be met. Here are the big hurdles to solar, wind and other renewable energy projects: EU PLAN TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IS SHELVED FOLLOWING FARMER PROTESTS ACROSS EUROPE Central banks in Europe and the U.S. have raised interest rates to combat inflation. That hits renewables harder than it does investment in fossil fuel projects. Renewables have much higher up-front costs to build wind farms, solar arrays and more, and that borrowing costs money. After that, operating costs are negligible since the wind and sun are free, of course — but high interest rates have made it harder to get new projects off the ground. In many cases, the answer is raising the agreed price of the electricity flowing to the grid to cover the added costs. Everything costs more these days — not just food and rent, but the electric cables, power turbines, construction materials and services needed to build wind or solar installations. One exception: solar panels have plunged in price due to massive Chinese production. Order backlogs and supply delays are growing because there are shortages of skilled engineers, raw materials and a lack of manufacturing capacity for complex machinery needed for renewable energy projects. An order for a new wind turbine or a transformer to connect to the grid can take months or longer to arrive than it did before the COVID-19 pandemic. So-called NIMBY syndrome remains an issue in many places. Germany's southern region of Bavaria, for example, is known for resisting the noise and appearance of wind turbines in its scenic landscape. Installations have lagged in Bavaria and other regions despite the German government's push for more renewable energy after losing affordable Russian natural gas used to heat homes, generate electricity and power factories. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Low-income countries have long faced much higher borrowing costs than the richer parts of the globe because government subsidies or other credit guarantees are uncertain. The result is that the same solar park if built today costs twice as much in Ghana as it would in the U.S. because of interest rates alone, according to Todd Moss, a former State Department official who heads the Energy for Growth Hub in Washington."

The march under the slogan ""Down with the Green Deal"" was organized by Solidarity, a farmers' trade union that is strongly opposed to the EU’s farming policies, in particular a policy known as the Green Deal which aims to make agriculture more climate friendly. The farmers say it interferes with their work and imposes high costs on them. ""We are protesting because we don’t want to become slaves on our own land,"" said dairy farmer Grazyna Gasowska from eastern Poland. EU PLAN TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IS SHELVED FOLLOWING FARMER PROTESTS ACROSS EUROPE ""According to the Green Deal we are supposed to grow what they tell us to, when they tell us to,"" Gasowska said as she held a national white-and-red flag. ""All those diversification requirements are very difficult for the farmers."" The noisy march stopped at the EU Warsaw office and then at parliament. ""Let Brussels eat worms, we prefer pork chops and potatoes,"" said one banner, referring to a general belief that the EU will advise eating insects and worms rather than cattle meat. The demonstration came as Poland’s political parties campaign ahead of elections next month for the European Parliament. The protest was supported by Polish right-wing opposition party Law and Justice, which held power from 2015 until late last year and is looking to regain political momentum. With an eye to the election, Tusk on Friday announced a reshuffle of his Cabinet to replace four ministers running for the European Parliament next month. The changes are also seen as a chance to bring new energy into Tusk’s government, which took office in December and embarked on deep reforms in many areas, including justice, foreign policy and the media.

He said there will be more changes in the future that would be dictated by the ""interest of the state.""

It was the second time in two years that the government's main climate action plan was found to be unlawful and insufficient in meeting legally-binding targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Justice Clive Sheldon sided Friday with three environmental groups that brought the case, ruling that the government's decision to approve its Carbon Budget Delivery Plan last year was ""simply not justified by the evidence."" UK PRIME MINISTER RISHI SUNAK MAKES CLIMATE ACTIVISTS SEETHE IN BOLD MOVE FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE The plan outlined how the U.K. aims to achieve its climate targets, including pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about two-thirds of 1990 levels by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2050. The judge said the details in the draft plan were ""vague and unquantified,"" and didn't provide officials with enough information on whether the plan should be approved.

Sultan al-Jaber of the United Arab Emirates, who also heads one of the country's state oil companies, told senior officials from Europe, Canada and China gathered in Brussels that record-breaking heat seen in parts of the world recently shows the need for urgent action to curb emissions. Laying out his strategy for the upcoming COP28 global climate talks in Dubai this fall, al-Jaber said that leaders ""must be brutally honest"" about what has caused the sharp rise in temperatures since preindustrial times and how to stop them from climbing further. While many fossil fuel companies have pledged to reduce direct and indirect emissions from their operations — known as scope 1 and 2 — many have refused to take responsibility for the scope 3 emissions resulting from sources they don't own or control, such as consumers using their gas.

Scientists say achieving this target requires halving global emissions by 2030 and current efforts are far off track. Many have expressed skepticism that technological solutions touted by the fossil fuel industry and some governments can deliver the reductions necessary to meet that goal in the near term.

The World Meteorological Organization, in an updated report, tallied nearly 12,000 extreme weather, climate and water-related events over the past half-century around the globe that have killed more than 2 million people and caused economic damage of $4.3 trillion. The stark recap from WMO came as it opened its four-yearly congress among member countries, pressing the message that more needs to be done to improve alert systems for extreme weather events by a target date of 2027. JOE MANCHIN BLASTS BIDEN ADMIN FOR CEDING CONTROL TO CCP ON GREEN ENERGY: 'PATHETIC' ""Economic losses have soared. But improved early warnings and coordinated disaster management has slashed the human casualty toll over the past half a century"" WMO said in a statement. The trend of rising economic damage is expected to continue. The Geneva-based agency has repeatedly warned about the impact of man-made climate change, saying rising temperatures have increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather — including floods, hurricanes, cyclones, heat waves and drought. WMO says early warning systems have helped reduce deaths linked to climate and other weather-related catastrophes. Most of the economic damage between 1970 and 2021 came in the United States — totaling $1.7 trillion — while nine in 10 deaths worldwide took place in developing countries. The economic impact, relative to gross domestic product, has been felt more in developing countries, WMO says. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said the cyclonic storm Mocha that swept across Myanmar and Bangladesh this month exemplified how the ""most vulnerable communities unfortunately bear the brunt of weather, climate and water-related hazards."" ""In the past, both Myanmar and Bangladesh suffered death tolls of tens and even hundreds of thousands of people,"" he said, alluding to previous catastrophes. ""Thanks to early warnings and disaster management these catastrophic mortality rates are now thankfully history."" ""Early warnings save lives,"" he said. The findings were a part of an update to WMO's Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes, which previously had covered a nearly 50-year period through 2019. SWISS BILLIONAIRE-BACKED ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SPENT BIG TARGETING MILLIONS OF BIDEN VOTERS WMO acknowledges some caveats to its report: While the number of disasters has risen, some of that may be due to improvements in reporting about extreme weather events that might have been overlooked in the past. While the findings account for inflation, WMO cautioned that estimating the economic toll can be an inexact science, and the reports could understate the actual damage. Worldwide, tropical cyclones were the primary cause of reported human and economic losses. In Africa, WMO counted more than 1,800 disasters and 733,585 deaths related to weather, climate and water extremes — including flooding and storm surges. The costliest was Tropical Cyclone Idai in 2019, which ran to $2.1 billion in damages. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nearly 1,500 disasters hit the southwest Pacific, causing 66,951 deaths and $185.8 billion in economic losses. Over 2,100 disasters in North America, Central America and the Caribbean led to 77,454 deaths and $2 trillion in economic losses. Asia faced over 3,600 disasters, costing 984,263 lives and $1.4 trillion in economic losses — that cost mostly due to the impact of cyclones. South America had 943 disasters that resulted in 58,484 deaths and over $115 billion in economic losses. Europe saw nearly 1,800 disasters that led to 166,492 deaths and $562 billion in economic losses. Last week, WMO forecast a 66% chance that within the next five years the Earth will face a year that averages 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than in the mid-19th century, reaching a key threshold targeted by the Paris climate accord of 2015."

BIDEN PLAN TO EXTEND OBAMACARE ELIGIBILITY TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS GETS PUSHBACK IN CONGRESS: 'MADNESS' Still, the U.S. remains positively viewed globally, although Russia and China are now seen as positively as the U.S. in most Middle East and North African countries surveyed, according to the study. The study, called the Democracy Perception Index (DPI) is one of the world’s largest annual studies on how people perceive the state of democracy in their respective countries and consisted of 63,000 interviews from people across 53 countries. It was conducted by the Denmark-based think tank Alliance of Democracies Foundation and the research group Latana. It did not provide a reason for the U.S. reputation decline.  The DPI found that faith in democracy has remained high across the globe over the past six years with 85% of those polled saying that it’s important to have democracy in their country. In Europe, countries have witnessed a sharp increase in the share of people who say that ""reducing immigration"" should be a top government priority as concerns about climate change fall, according to a global study published on Wednesday. About 5.1 million immigrants entered the EU from non-EU countries in 2022, an increase of around 117%, or 2.7 million, compared to 2021, European data shows. However, governments don’t always live up to people’s expectations. While 58% of respondents were satisfied with the state of democracy in their country, the remainder were not. In the U.S., 60% of respondents said that unfair elections and/or election fraud threatens the country's democracy, while about 77% said that corruption is a threat to democracy.  LESS THAN 1 IN 4 AMERICANS HAVE FAVORABLE OPINION OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT: POLL The study said dissatisfaction was not limited to non-democratic countries. It was also prevalent in the U.S., Europe and in other places with a long democratic tradition.  Israel, Ukraine and Russia have all experienced a ""rally around the flag"" effect, with the public perception that the government is acting in the interest of the majority of the people increasing rapidly after the start of their respective conflicts. In Ukraine, however, this perception declined sharply after it peaked in 2022. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the chair of the Alliance of Democracies Foundation and former Danish Prime Minister, says that these figures are an eye-opener and the trend shows there is a risk of losing the Global South to the autocracies. About half of the people around the world, in both democratic and non-democratic countries, feel that their government is acting only in the interest of a small group of people. Over the past four years, this perception has remained highest in Latin America, lowest in Asia and has steadily increased in Europe since 2020 – particularly in Germany, the study shows.  ""Defending democracy means advancing freedom around the world, but it also means listening to voters’ concerns at home… We are witnessing an axis of autocracies forming from China to Russia to Iran. We must act now to make freedom more attractive than dictatorship and unite through an alliance of democracies to push back against the emboldened autocrats. War and violent conflict is increasingly seen as the most important global challenge, followed by poverty and hunger, and climate change. The last year has seen a global rise in the share of people who say that migration and terrorism are among the world’s largest challenges, particularly among Europeans.  At the national level, most people want their governments to focus more on poverty reduction, corruption and economic growth.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, there are strong regional differences in priorities: Europeans and Americans are much more likely to want their government to prioritize improving healthcare, fighting climate change and reducing immigration than countries in Asia and Latin America, where fighting corruption and promoting growth are seen as more important. Globally, 33% of those surveyed believe climate change is one of the world’s three main challenges, but only 14% say fighting it should be among the top three priorities for their government. Immigration is likely to play a major role in next month’s European elections where nationalist parties are expected to make significant gains.   ""Around the world people want to live under democracy but these figures are a wake-up call for all democratic governments,"" Rasmussen said. In Europe, about a third of Hungarians believe they live in a democracy. The Associated Press contributed to this report. "

https://www.foxnews.com/world/vietnam-implements-new-rice-farming-techniques-effort-mitigate-methane-emissions,Vietnam implements new rice farming techniques in effort to mitigate methane emissions,04-23-2024,"Vietnam is aiming to transform its rice sector, making it more resilient to climate change while also reducing its emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas.","There is one thing that distinguishes 60-year-old Vo Van Van’s rice fields from a mosaic of thousands of other emerald fields across Long An province in southern Vietnam’s Mekong Delta: It isn’t entirely flooded. That and the giant drone, its wingspan similar to that of an eagle, chuffing high above as it rains organic fertilizer onto the knee-high rice seedlings billowing below. Using less water and using a drone to fertilize are new techniques that Van is trying and Vietnam hopes will help solve a paradox at the heart of growing rice: The finicky crop isn’t just vulnerable to climate change but also contributes uniquely to it. AFRICAN DRONE COMPANY USES AI TO GIVE VITAL HELP TO US FRUIT AND NUT FARMERS Rice must be grown separately from other crops and seedlings have to be individually planted in flooded fields; backbreaking, dirty work requiring a lot of labor and water that generates a lot of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80-times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide. It's a problem unique to growing rice, as inundated fields stop oxygen from entering the soil, creating the conditions for methane-producing bacteria. Rice paddies contribute 8% of all human-made methane in the atmosphere, according to a 2023 Food and Agriculture Organization report. Vietnam is the world's third-largest rice exporter, and the staple importance to Vietnamese culture is palpable in the Mekong Delta. The fertile patchwork of green fields crisscrossed by silvery waterways has helped stave off famine since the Vietnam War ended in 1975. Rice isn't just the mainstay of most meals, it is considered a gift from the gods and continues to be venerated. It is molded into noodles and sheets and fermented into wine. In busy markets, motorcyclists lug 22 pound bags to their homes. Barges haul mountains of the grain up and down the Mekong River. Rice kernels are then dried and hulled by machines before they're packed for sale in factories, lined from floor to ceiling with sacks of rice. STUDY FINDS ORGANIC FARMING RESULTS IN CONVENTIONAL FARMS RAMPING UP THEIR PESTICIDE USE Van has been working with one of Vietnam’s largest rice exporters, the Loc Troi Group, for the past two years and is using a different method of irrigation known as alternate wetting and drying, or AWD. This requires less water than traditional farming since his paddy fields aren’t continuously submerged. They also produce less methane. Using the drone to fertilize the crops saves on labor costs. With climate shocks pushing a migration to cities, Van said that it's harder to find people to work the farms. It also ensures precise amounts of fertilizers are applied. Too much fertilizer causes the soil to release Earth-warming nitrogen gases. Once crops are harvested, Van no longer burns the rice stubble — a major cause of air pollution in Vietnam and in its neighbors, as well as Thailand and India. Instead, it's collected by the Loc Troi Group for sale to other companies that use it as livestock feed and for growing straw mushrooms, a popular addition to stir-fries. Van benefits in various ways. His costs are down while his farm yield is the same. Using organic fertilizer enables him to sell to European markets where customers are willing to pay a premium for organic rice. Best of all, he has time to tend to his own garden. ""I am growing jackfruit and coconut,"" he said. Loc Troi Group CEO Nguyen Duy Thuan said that those methods enable farmers to use 40% less rice seed and 30% less water. Costs for pesticides, fertilizer and labor also are lower. Thuan said Loc Troi — which exports to more than 40 countries including in Europe, Africa, the United States and Japan — is working with farmers to expand acreage using its methods from the current 100 hectares to 300,000 hectares. That's a long way from Vietnam’s own target of growing ""high quality, low emission rice"" on 1 million hectares of farmland, an area more than six times the size of London, by 2030. Vietnamese officials estimate that would reduce production costs by a fifth and increase farmers' profits by more than $600 million, according to the state media outlet Vietnam News. Vietnam recognized early on that it had to reconfigure its rice sector. It was the largest rice exporter, ahead of both India and Thailand, to sign a 2021 pledge to reduce methane emissions at the annual United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Each year, the industry suffers losses of over $400 million, according to recent research by Vietnam’s Water Resources Science Institute. This is worrying, not just for the country but for the world. The Mekong Delta, where 90% of Vietnam's exported rice is farmed, is one of the world's regions most vulnerable to climate change. A U.N. climate change report in 2022 warned of heavier flooding in the wet season and droughts in the dry season. Scores of dams built upstream in China and Laos have reduced the river's flow and the amount of sediment that it carries downriver to the sea. The sea level is rising and turning the river's lower reaches salty. And unsustainable levels of groundwater pumping and sand mining for construction have added to the problems. Changing centuries-old forms of rice farming is expensive, and even though methane is a more potent cause of global warming than carbon dioxide, it only receives 2% of climate financing, Ajay Banga, the World Bank's president, told the U.N. climate summit in Dubai last year. Combating methane emissions is the ""one rare, clear area"" where low-cost, effective and replicable solutions exist, Banga said. The World Bank is supporting Vietnam's efforts and has begun helping the Indonesian government to expand climate resilient farming as a part of more than a dozen projects to reduce methane worldwide. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The hope is that more countries will follow, though there is no ""one-size-fits-all,"" said Lewis H. Ziska, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. ""The one commonality is that water is needed,"" he said, adding that different methods of planting and irrigation can help manage water better. Growing more genetically diverse rice varieties would also help because some are more resilient to excess heat or require less water, while others might even emit less methane, he said. Nguyen Van Nhut, director of the rice export company Hoang Minh Nhat, said its suppliers are using varieties of rice that can thrive even when the water is briny and the heat is extreme. Now, the business is adapting to the unseasonal rains that make it harder to dry the rice, adding to risks from mold or insect damage. Typically, rice is dried in the sun immediately after harvest, but Nhut said his company has drying facilities in their packaging factory and also will install machinery to dry the grains closer to the fields. ""We don’t know which month is the rainy season, like we did before,"" he said."
https://www.foxnews.com/world/vietnams-mekong-delta-residents-increasingly-migrate-cities-climate-concerns,Vietnam's Mekong Delta residents increasingly migrate to cities due to climate concerns,03-13-2024,"In Vietnam's Mekong Delta, people from impoverished backgrounds are increasingly drawn to cities, seeking refuge from the region's climate vulnerability.","Dao Bao Tran and her brother Do Hoang Trung, 11-year-old twins growing up on a rickety houseboat in the Mekong Delta, have dreams. Tran loves K-pop, watches videos at night to learn Korean and would love to visit Seoul. Trung wants to be a singer. But their hopes are ""unrealistic,"" said Trung: ""I know I’ll end up going to the city to try and make a living."" The twins' single mother, Do Thi Son Ca, left to seek work in Ho Chi Minh City soon after her children were born. She left them with her mother, 59-year-old Nguyen Thi Thuy. Unable to afford rent on land, the small family has lived on a small houseboat ever since. The call of the city, where factory jobs promise better salaries, is often too hard to resist for the region’s 17 million inhabitants. Such dreams have a way of dissipating in southern Vietnam's Mekong, one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world. XI JINPING ARRIVES IN VIETNAM AS CHINA COURTS LEADERSHIP FOR ALLIANCE On good days she makes about $4 — hardly enough to put food on the table. The twins have already missed two years of school when their grandmother couldn’t pay the fees and their mother, struggling in the city, couldn't help either. Now their houseboat on the Hau River, their only refuge, is in urgent need of expensive repairs and Thuy is wondering how she'll find $170 before the rainy season. MARINE, VIETNAM VETERAN 'VIOLENTLY MURDERED' IN FLORIDA IDENTIFIED MORE THAN 40 YEARS AFTER REMAINS FOUND Thuy rents a smaller boat to sell meat and bean buns at the Cai Rang floating market, the largest of its kind in the Mekong Delta. She rises well before dawn to steam the buns in a metal urn over glowing coals nestled in the middle of the boat, standing in the bow to pull a massive pair of oars to make her way to the market. For the poor, the future is especially uncertain. A U.N. climate change report in 2022 warned there will be more floods in the wet season and drought in the dry season. Unsustainable extraction of groundwater and sand for construction have made matters worse. And with rising seas gnawing away at its southern edge and dams hemming the Mekong River upstream, farming in the fertile delta is getting harder. Its contribution to Vietnam’s GDP has dropped from 27% in 1990 to less than 18% in 2019, according to a 2020 report by the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ""The storms are becoming more violent,"" said Thuy. In the rainy season, heavy rains can mean pumping water furiously so her houseboat doesn't sink. Flooding forces Thuy to move the boat to a bigger canal to avoid a battering if she were to remain anchored at shore, but the larger canal comes with its own risks in the form of bigger waves. ""Every generation still struggles,"" she said. And moving to the city doesn't guarantee anything. The twins’ mother had a new beginning when she moved to Ho Chi Minh City, finding a job in a clothing factory, marrying and having a baby. But both she and her husband were eventually laid off — among the thousands of workers in Vietnam to lose their jobs because of low overseas orders. They have since moved back to his home village. Ca, 34, never finished school and she is looking for work but does not know what they’ll do next. ""My family is poor. So I don't think too far ahead. I just hope my children can receive a full education,"" she said. For now she won’t be able to help her family with the school fees or boat repairs and also didn't see the kids for Tet, the lunar new year festival in Vietnam. Vu, the migration specialist, said older workers who return to their villages after layoffs often don't want to go back to a city where they ""had their rose-colored glasses pulled off"" by the daily struggle. That includes Pham Van Sang, 50, who left his native Bac Lieu province for Ho Chi Minh City in his 20s after unpredictable weather made growing rice and shrimp no longer viable. Today, he and his wife, Luong Thi Ut, 51, live in a room that's about 100 square feet (9.2 meters), crammed with what they need to operate a food stall for factory workers in the city. Their main offering is a Mekong-style intense fish noodle dish that, he says, brings homesick factory workers ""comfort"" with a taste of their old lives. Moving away from the Mekong to bigger cities or even abroad for better prospects isn't new. But the net outmigration — the difference between people moving out of the delta and those moving in — more than tripled after 1999. Experts caution that the reasons people move are complex, and it's difficult to know how great a role climate change plays. ""Climate change is both a catalyst and accelerant for migration,"" said Mimi Vu, a trafficking and migration specialist based in Ho Chi Minh City. It has hurt livelihoods and worsens inequities in a region that is still less developed than other parts of Vietnam, she said. The region lacks solid development foundations such as high rates of students finishing high school, consistent access to clean water and adequate health care. Sang said he's haunted by memories of home, being young in the countryside, of raising shrimp with his family. ""I’m sad for the generation of children and grandchildren who have no future,"" he said. Vietnam's government has approved a plan to strengthen the Mekong region's agricultural economy, which produces about half the country's rice and is critical to feed other countries, like Indonesia and Philippines, too. The plan includes trying new technologies to reduce emissions from rice while increasing yields and profits, creating more fisheries and fruit orchards, and building airports and highways to lure foreign investment. But the allure of Ho Chi Minh City — a bustling metropolis of 9.3 million people, Vietnam's financial engine — is hard to resist for many, especially the young. Even those in the countryside see moving to the city, or better yet moving abroad, as the fastest way out of poverty, said Trung Hieu, 23. Hieu lives in a dormitory that he shares with another young man from the delta. He works two jobs — a 12-hour shift in a factory that makes pharmaceutical parts followed by hours spent riding his motorcycle for a Vietnamese ride-hailing company. He enjoyed school and wanted to be a literature teacher, but his family’s farm income in Dong Thap province in the Mekong had been decimated over the years. When he finished school, his family had to choose whether to send him to college or allow his younger sister to finish school. 10 DEAD IN VIETNAM AFTER FIRE BURNS 9-STORY APARTMENT BUILDING He chose to move to the city so that he could send money back home. ""My sister is doing well in school, I'm very happy,"" he said. Hieu initially found the city bewildering and felt homesick, but slowly the city grew on him. 'You gradually adapt, you survive,"" he said. He is learning how to thrive in the city: hard work, but also networking and communicating. Still, he hopes to someday go to college and fulfill his dream of becoming a teacher, and work in a school in the delta like the ones he and his sister studied in. He said it would make him feel closer to home. ""Everyone wants to go back to where they were born and raised,"" he said."

In a stark warning, White House senior adviser for energy and investment, Amos Hochstein, said mineral resources in nations like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia were essential to meeting enormous global demand for clean energy components and power infrastructure to support the growth of artificial intelligence. They also offered an alternative to the world's current dependence on China. ""We can all live in the capitals and cities around the world and say 'I don't want to do business there.' But what you are really saying is we're not going to have an energy transition,"" Hochstein said on a panel at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles. ""Because the energy transition is not going to happen if it can only be produced where I live, under my standards."" US, CANADA AND INDIGENOUS GROUPS ANNOUNCE PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS CROSS-BORDER MINING POLLUTION President Joe Biden's landmark climate change law, the Inflation Reduction Act, created big subsidies for producers of minerals like lithium and copper that are needed in equipment like batteries and solar panels. The same is now needed for projects in countries that possess large amounts of those resources but may have poor labor and environmental standards and less stable political systems, Hochstein said. ""If you want to invest in, whether it's Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Congo, Zambia, DRC, etc, Angola - these are different profile countries that have different kinds of risks associated with them. And Western finance has basically said we will not be able to absorb this risk,"" Hochstein said. The United States and Group of Seven (G7) nations as well as Australia, South Korea and Saudi Arabia must collaborate to unlock capital that would back up companies that currently are unwilling to take on projects in countries they deem risky to their reputations or assets, Hochstein said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The capital could flow through U.S. agencies like the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, Export-Import Bank of the United States and global institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Those collaborations must offer countries incentives to improve their communities and quality of life, Hochstein said. ""The government has a real role here of incentivizing private capital by taking more risk in this initial work, in a responsible manner, but more risk to allow the private sector to come in, augment it and allow the investment so that we have a diversified, sustainable and equitable energy transition,"" Hochstein said."

https://www.foxnews.com/media/college-student-tracks-taylor-swifts-private-jet-emissions-no-plans-stop-empty-legal-threat,College student who tracks Taylor Swift's private jet emissions has no plans to stop: ‘Empty legal threat’,02-28-2024,College student Jack Sweeney is not backing down from threats of legal action by Taylor Swift's team over his tracking of her and others' private jet usage.,"The college student who has garnered national attention for his social media account that tracks the private jet excursions of important public figures spoke with Fox News Digital about his resolve to keep doing so, despite strong warnings and harsh words from the likes of Taylor Swift and Elon Musk.  TRAVIS KELCE'S DAD BLASTS ‘TROLL’ BETHENNY FRANKEL OVER LATEST TAYLOR SWIFT REMARKS During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jack Sweeney, a junior at the University of Central Florida, started tracking the flights and locations of some jet users based on publicly available information. Using the flight data published by the Federal Aviation Administration, Sweeney has tracked the private jet flights of figures like Swift, Musk, Mark Cuban, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.  Sweeney was also accused of ""disregarding the personal safety of others""; ""willful and repeated harassment""; and ""intentional, offensive, and outrageous conduct and consistent violations of our client’s privacy."" Sweeney described it as ""really quite unbelievable"" that, as a college student, he has powerful people like Swift and her team coming after him. Swift has taken criticism at times for her use of jets and its effect on the environment, but her representatives say she's purchased more than double the ""carbon credits"" to offset its impact, according to the Washington Post. ""We don't know what's happening other than what we've been told, but the letter from Ms. Swift's lawyers came shortly after increased public scrutiny of the carbon emissions from her frequent private jet travel,"" Sweeney's lawyer, Ethan Jacobs, said. ""There is not, as we know, a specific threat to Ms. Swift's personal safety that is the result of somebody knowing when her jet landed someplace."" ""The information that Mr. Sweeney publishes through his accounts lets the public know where celebrities are traveling if they're interested in them, lets them know about the carbon emissions from their planes and other information that generally benefits society, and making it harder to access would be bad for all of us,"" he added.  In December, Swift's attorneys sent a cease-and-desist letter to Sweeney, blaming his automated tracking of her private jet for tipping off stalkers about her location, stating that ""the timing of stalkers"" suggests a connection to Sweeney’s flight-tracking sites. Swift, who has dealt with stalkers throughout her career, is in the midst of her record-breaking ""Eras"" concert tour that's brought her to new heights of stardom. ""There's all kinds of people who track planes, I'm not the only one, it's just I'm the one getting awareness for it,"" Sweeney said. TAYLOR SWIFT RESPONDS TO CRITICS AFTER JET TOPS WORST PRIVATE PLANE CO2 EMISSIONS LIST: ‘LOANED OUT’ TO OTHERS Using publicly available transponder signals transmitted by planes, he said he and thousands of other aviation hobbyists use the transponder signals that are transmitted openly in the air from planes. This data is mandated by the FAA.  ""The letter that Ms. Swift's team of lawyers sent to Mr. Sweeney, does some sort of hand-waving to suggest that his account is unlawful,"" he said. ""But it's also only in the most vague kind of way. That's because there is no law that prohibits republishing the publicly available flight information that is on the accounts that Mr. Sweeney makes available.""  Sweeney said he has simply made it easier for people to view this data by setting up automated social media accounts to track the miles, location, jet fuel, cost of fuel and tons of CO2 emissions for every flight a public figure takes. If people have expertise and know what they are doing, Sweeney said anybody could do what he does. ""It's crazy to send a letter like that when there were thousands of people tracking her besides me and you want me to stop?"" he added. ""It's kind of crazy because other people are going to do it anyway, and at the end of the day, it's public information. I'm not doing anything illegal."" ""Sweeney is an awful human being,"" Musk posted on Feb. 6. ""Taylor Swift is right to be concerned."" ""These are some of the biggest people in the world and really, I started out being a fan of Elon Musk, and now he obviously really does not like me,"" Sweeney said. ""Which is unbelievable."" ""I like to just bring awareness to the facts and information,"" he added. ""I'm not going to say that you shouldn't or should use private jets, I just want to put the information there. I don't want to force anybody's view on anything."" Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington, told ""Good Morning America"" earlier this month that he didn't see any civil or criminal violation in Sweeney's conduct. Sweeney was suspended from Twitter, now X, in 2022 by owner Elon Musk, who said the sharing of real-time location information violated the platform’s terms of service and was dangerous for himself and members of his family. Sweeney's account has since been restored.  Jacobs said Sweeney has done nothing unlawful by creating social media accounts that are only republishing public information, calling it an empty threat. LAWYER OF STUDENT TRACKING TAYLOR SWIFT'S JET SAYS CLIENT WON'T ‘BUCKLE’ AFTER STAR ORDERS HIM TO STOP  ""I'm not going to let someone in a bigger power position try to hide that information from the people when I think the fact of them trying to hide it makes it even much more important for transparency to be shared,"" he said.  Sweeney said he plans to continue doing what he does because he believes it's important knowledge for people to have.  Jacobs said it's common for wealthy people to have teams of people working for them, which includes lawyers, who send letters to try to ""push people around."" TAYLOR SWIFT TRIES TO ESCAPE ‘CLIMATE POLICE’ WITH HELP FROM CARBON OFFSETS: WALL STREET JOURNAL In the letter to Sweeney, Swift's lawyers called him out as ""notorious for disregarding the personal safety of others in exchange for public attention and/or requests for financial gain."" Jacobs said he and Sweeney don't take lightly the question of whether it is the right thing to do.  ""We are aware of your public disputes with other high-profile individuals and your tactics in those interactions, including offering to stop your harmful behavior only in exchange for items of value,"" Swift's team wrote in the letter. ""While this may be a game to you, or an avenue that you hope will earn you wealth or fame, it is a life-or-death matter for our Client."" Tree Paine, a spokeswoman for Swift, told the Washington Post earlier this month, ""We cannot comment on any ongoing police investigation but can confirm the timing of stalkers suggests a connection. His posts tell you exactly when and where she would be."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Jacobs said Sweeney had not been made aware of evidence that his account could help someone hurt Swift. He added such letters from powerful people like Swift might chill speech even if there is no legal basis.  Representatives for Swift and Musk didn't return requests for comment."
https://www.foxnews.com/media/communist-china-survivor-un-eco-socialists-hypocrisy-eating-meat-marxist-playbook,Communist China survivor blasts UN 'eco-socialists' for hypocrisy on eating meat: 'From the Marxist playbook',12/10/2023,"The Federalist senior contributor Helen Raleigh, who grew up in communist China, criticized U.N. climate summit attendees' double standard on meat consumption.","The U.N.'s calls for the West to cut back on beef to fight climate change is enshrined in hypocrisy as elites at the COP28 summit in Dubai reportedly dined on gourmet food options from vendors who serve beef, and it's raising red flags for one critic who says the double standard reminds her of growing up in communist China. ""When I was growing up, the Chinese government imposed a very strict food rationing system, including limitation on meat,"" Helen Raleigh, senior contributor at The Federalist, told ""FOX & Friends Weekend"" on Sunday. Under a strict food rationing system, coupons allowed residents to purchase two pounds of meat per month, but, due to widespread food shortages, even that wasn't guaranteed. UN CLIMATE SUMMIT SERVING GOURMET BURGERS, BBQ AS IT CALLS FOR AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT  ""Without having meat for weeks or months, without a good source of nutrition, the Chinese people's life expectancy back in the 1960s was only 44 years. But nowadays, when Chinese people actually have more meat in their diet, the life expectancy has improved to about 77 years."" Raleigh said the shift is indicative of how ruinous government policies can be to people's well-being. 

GOP REP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING UN FOR CALLING ON AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT Outrage stirred after the United Nations called on countries that allegedly over-consume meat – including the U.S. –  to curb such consumption to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. For years, the U.N. has called for people to ditch animal-based diets since they allegedly ""have a high impact on our planet."" Meanwhile, those attending the summit were treated to dining options that included ""juicy beef"" and ""slabs of succulent meat,"" among others, according to the summit's online portal. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., who plans to introduce a resolution condemning the U.N.'s recommendations for reducing meat consumption, told Fox News Digital that the ""hypocrisy"" of the global elites ""never ceases to amaze."" ""They’re the same ones who want working people to swear off flying at all while they get to travel to glitzy conferences on private jets to push a radical green agenda,"" he continued. Raleigh branded the climate alarmists as ""eco-socialist[s],"" telling FOX News co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy she believes their rationales are ""derived directly from the Marxist playbook."" ""It's not about the climate. They don't really care about lowering global warming or helping the climate,"" she said. UNITED NATIONS SET TO CALL ON AMERICANS TO REDUCE MEAT CONSUMPTION ""Their intent is control, to control the freedom people [have] to choose how they want to live their life. They want to tell us what car to drive, what source of energy we should use, what stove we should cook a meal on, and now, they're not satisfied with those restrictions. They want to actually tell us how much to eat and what to eat on a monthly basis."" ""It's all about control of freedom. It has nothing to do with the environment,"" she continued.

Kennedy torches Olympic skier's 'expert' climate change testimony: The 'Kardashian-ing of America',03-26-2024,"Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., elaborates on his fiery exchange with Olympic skier Gus Schumacher who testified before the Senate Budget Committee as an expert witness.","During a Senate Budget Committee hearing last week, Olympic skier Gus Schumacher faced a grilling by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., after being called to testify as one of the Democrats' ""expert witnesses"" on climate change. On ""Hannity,"" Monday, Kennedy elaborated on his exchange with Schumacher, labeling his testimony as an example of the ""‘Kardashian-ing’ of America."" GOP LEADERS CONFRONT BIDEN'S NEW CLIMATE CZAR ON KEY SECURITY RISKS LURKING IN GREEN AGENDA SEN. JOHN KENNEDY: Mr. Schumacher, I understand, is a superb skier, and I'm sure he's a fine young man. But the fact remains that my Democratic colleagues invited Mr. Schumacher to testify before the Budget Committee of the United States Senate as an expert on climate change to advise us on climate change legislation. And Mr. Schumacher could neither defend nor substantiate his rhetoric. I suppose his testimony is an example of the ‘Kardashian-ing’ of America. I don't mean to be cruel, but Mr. Schumacher's testimony reminded me so much of... the gormless pop singers and movie stars who partied with Harvey Weinstein, who incessantly lecture the American people and who also have to lie down if they think too hard. And I'm sorry Mr. Schumacher had a difficult day, but you shouldn't hold yourself out as an expert or have an opinion if you can't defend it. Schumacher struggled to defend his position as an ""expert witness"" on climate change, repeatedly declining to answer Kennedy's questions. The 23-year-old was invited by Democrats to address the impact of climate change on the environment and recreational activities. Kennedy also called out Schumacher for previous tweets relating to the ""war on drugs"" and abolishing the police, while challenging him on the U.S. potentially spending trillions of dollars to ""reduce world temperatures."" Kennedy said the Left's plan to bring the world to carbon-neutrality amounts to a ""fantasy,"" based on the trillions in spending it would require.  Schumacher later said that Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., the chairman of the committee, apologized to him for Kennedy's ""aggressive"" questions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-uses-billions-dollars-your-money-buy-himself-votes,Biden uses billions of dollars of your money to buy himself votes,06/03/2024,Biden has been using billions of dollars to give Democrat constituents. The money helps shore up his base for November. The Inflation Reduction Act gave him $2.8 billion to buy votes.,"To bet on the upcoming presidential election, don't just rely on polls. Look at the billions of taxpayer dollars President Joe Biden is pouring into ""community organizations"" in ""disadvantaged communities"" to tip the election scales.  The community organizer who became president, Barack Obama, was a master at machine politics, using federal tax dollars to turn community organizations – left-wing not-for-profits – into a fifth estate. Their staffs, paid using taxpayer money but not tied to government rules, could hit the streets at election time and build turnout. Biden has scaled up Obama's playbook, using billions of dollars instead of mere millions.   Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) made headlines recently with the discovery that in December 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency awarded a $50 million ""environmental justice"" grant to the Climate Justice Alliance. Capito is distressed to learn that the Climate Justice Alliance vows ""the path to climate justice travels through a free Palestine.""  BIDEN ADMIN PRIORITIZES $900 MILLION FOR GREEN SCHOOL BUSES AS ILLITERACY PLAGUES US SCHOOLS In fact, Climate Justice Alliance serves up a full agenda of radical activities, including fighting ""political oppression"" and ""placing race, gender, and class at the center"" of its climate solutions.  But $50 million for the Climate Justice Alliance is a drop in the bucket.  Had members of Congress read the Inflation Reduction Act before passing it – a novel idea – they would know the law provides $2.8 billion to the EPA for environmental and climate justice block grants,"" (Section 60201). That's a license to hand out walking-around money to many political activists, not just the Climate Justice Alliance.   Another recipient: the New York Immigration Coalition, which describes itself as a ""coalition of immigrant and refugee organizations"" pushing for more government services and political clout.  Same is true of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, another recipient. The words ""climate"" and ""environment"" don't appear anywhere on these groups' websites or literature.  Lawmakers may have assumed the money was for climate improvement, but the IRA's fine print allows the moolah to be used for ""facilitating engagement of marginalized communities in Local, State and Federal public processes, such as advisory groups, workshops, rulemakings."" Translation: elections.  How easy is it to get the dough? Piece of cake. The EPA says it wants to ""alleviate much of the burden that the federal grants process places on small, resource-constrained community-based organizations supporting underserved communities and marginalized populations."" In short, no jumping through hoops.  The money can only go to a disadvantaged community or a southern border town. There are 27,521 disadvantaged communities on the census map, according to Biden's ""Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool,"" which targets non-English speakers, people with diabetes, and other factors that mostly correspond to heavily minority populations. These communities customarily vote Democratic.  Adding eligibility for border towns is an interesting twist. As waves of migrants overwhelm resources in these towns, Democrats are growing divided over Biden's open border policies. Money may shore up support.  During his first week as president, Biden announced the Justice40 initiative by executive order, requiring that 40% of many types of federal spending – not just EPA grants – must go to these ""disadvantaged communities.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Department of Energy is spreading money to these ""disadvantaged communities,"" using what it calls ""community benefit plans"" and promising that application requirements will be ""intentionally flexible.""  The playbook started with the Affordable Care Act. The ACA, or ""Obamacare,"" authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to hand out ""community transformation grants."" Community Health Councils, a typical recipient, pledged that its mission was to advance ""social justice.""   It distributed 65% of the money to partner community groups that promoted ""voter engagement,"" conducted ""one-on-one education in the streets"" or led tenants' rights, anti-fracking and anti-drilling efforts. And you thought the ACA was about covering the uninsured.  A decade after Obama, Biden is tasking every agency and department of the federal government to promote voter engagement.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden's community grants pale in size compared to the student debt cancellation vote-buying that now totals $620 billion. But the community grant money lands directly in the hands of political activists who know what to do with it.  Tell your congressional rep to read the bills before voting on them and strip out these provisions for community giveaways that make a mockery of democracy.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-biggest-sotu-obstacles,Biden’s biggest SOTU obstacles,03/06/2024,The usual State of the Union challenges may be overshadowed by more basic ones. Can President Biden make it through gaffe-free? Will we be able to understand his words?,"The obstacle course facing President Biden this week during Thursday’s belated State of the Union address presents a formidable challenge. It may prove difficult for the 81-year-old president to navigate. Expectations could not be lower.   Biden faces the usual challenges of exaggerating his paltry policy wins, justifying his substantial missteps and attacking his political opponents. But those questions may be overshadowed by more basic ones.   Can he make it from start to finish gaffe-free? Will we be able to understand his words? Will this be one of the shortest addresses ever? Will he even be able to find his way off the stage? Keep in mind - if he has a ""senior moment"" this time, the Easter Bunny won’t be there to save him. We need a commander in chief who can negotiate. In this case, negotiate the steps to the podium, a smaller teleprompter and staying awake after sundown.  BIDEN CAMPAIGN AIMS TO USE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AS RESET AFTER DAMNING SPECIAL COUNSEL CLAIMS: REPORT But there are also very real questions about his ability to negotiate to avoid war in the Middle East, deescalate conflict in Ukraine, stop millions from pouring over our borders (including countless criminals), and preserve our access to affordable energy and health care. Perhaps he pulls it off. But a two-minute video released on his X account in February raised eyebrows when readers identified at least 29 jump cuts. That raises the question: Can Biden still form coherent sentences in a live setting – and for how long? Will he ad-lib and start dishing out a Kamala Harris-style word salad? Despite vociferous assurances from press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre that he ""passes a cognitive test every day,"" he likewise seems to generate new questions about his competence nearly as often.   On Friday, Biden appeared confused in a bilateral meeting with the Italian prime minister, mixing up Ukraine and Gaza. His obvious cognitive decline is being lampooned around the world, including a recent viral skit from Italy.   FOX NEWS POLL: MAJORITIES SAY BIDEN HAS MOSTLY FAILED ON TOP ISSUES The justification to elect President Biden was supposed to be his ability to work with Congress, where he served for decades. We were told he could bring the nation together, working with world leaders he claims he knows so well. But on all those fronts, after three years, President Biden has failed. No doubt Biden will predictably point blame at Republicans. He’ll take numerous shots at Donald Trump. That’s cheap, easy and definitely going to happen. It is an election year, after all. But Biden's biggest obstacle will be his tenuous relationship with reality and truth. Gaslighting is his best hope. Biden will claim a vibrant economy. But no matter what his manipulated statistics say, Americans know their own budgets. The economy is worse than it was with Trump, and Americans feel it in their wallets every day. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Biden will blame climate change for everything, including the flood of illegal border crossings. Americans know that is not true.  He will chastise Congress for lack of action, hoping Americans have forgotten that Democrats controlled the House, the Senate and the White House during the first two years of his presidency.   He will say democracy is under attack. But America is aware that Democrats are the ones trying to prohibit his opponent from even being on the ballot. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden will use the best of what his speech writers have to offer. They will attempt bold verbal gymnastics to gaslight Americans about his Israel policies, his equity agenda, his open support of censorship and more. But it will all be at odds with truth and reality. And increasing numbers of Americans see it. This simple regurgitation of the same Biden policies that have already failed us won’t move the needle in his favor. And despite his shouting mixed with occasional whispering, Americans will recognize that the guy first elected in 1972 is out of gas. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON CHAFFETZ"
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-trillion-dollar-climate-agenda-blowing-up-john-kerry-answer,Biden's trillion dollar climate agenda is blowing up and John Kerry has a lot to answer for,01-16-2024,Climate czar John Kerry will reportedly step away from his post soon to campaign for President Biden's reelection. That could be tough since we're looking at a boondoggle gone bust.,"No wonder John Kerry is stepping down as climate czar. Joe Biden’s trillion-dollar green agenda is blowing up, and no one is more closely tied to the fast-deflating boondoggle than John Kerry.  The push for electric vehicles is a bust, renewable projects like offshore wind farms are being canceled by the boatload, people are tired of being told they can’t buy things they want, like gas stoves and incandescent light bulbs and – guess what? – sane people in our country are willing to admit (finally) that the world will run on fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.  Even Wall Street elites are throwing in the towel; ESG funds, scorched by their high fees and avoidance of oil and gas stocks, are drying up.  JOHN KERRY TO STEP DOWN AS BIDEN ADMIN CLIMATE CZAR: REPORT Just last week, Chesapeake Energy announced it will spend $7.4 billion to purchase Southwestern Energy, creating what will be our country’s largest producer of natural gas. The combined companies will feed an ever-growing demand for U.S. gas to supply LNG exports, essential to loosening Russia’s grip on Europe’s energy. The acquisition signals confidence that Biden’s crack-down on oil and natural gas production has run smack into a reality brick wall; much as the White House wants to pander to the climate lobby, we need fossil fuels. In 2022, Biden promised our NATO allies the U.S. would ramp up LNG exports to help supply their energy needs. Even as he did so, his confused administration continued to roll out regulations that make generating such supplies more costly and more difficult. Just last week, the White House proposed new fines on methane emissions, part of a broader crackdown that could reportedly make a large number of smaller oil and gas wells uneconomic and curb U.S. production by as much as 5%.  Right now the feds are deliberating whether to permit construction of another LNG terminal on the Louisiana Coast. Will the White House climate zealots actually decide against it?  At the same time, war in the Middle East is driving home once again that energy security is national security; the government’s war on fossil fuels looks dumber by the minute. Aggression from Russia’s Putin and Iran’s mullahs is funded by oil; they would have less money to invest in malicious activities were it not for the Biden White House discouraging U.S. production which could bring global prices down. US output is currently 13.2 million barrels per day, finally surpassing the 13 mb/d peak reached during the Trump presidency. But….it would be higher but for the delays in leasing, increased fees, and other obstacles thrown up by the Biden group.    Kerry and Joe Biden have a lot to answer for. After all, if the climate agenda were such a resounding success, why isn’t the president tooting his horn about solar fields and electric stoves instead of yelling that Trump is an existential threat to our democracy? John Kerry is reportedly going to join the campaign team to remind voters how successful Biden’s climate program has been. Will that boost Biden’s chances? It’s hard to imagine Kerry touring the country and cheering on the White House’s push for electric vehicles, for instance. After all, in just the past several days, Hertz decided to sell the bulk of its EV rental fleet – 20,000 cars -- because they are sitting idle on their lots and cost too much money to maintain. Americans don’t want to rent EVs, and they don’t want to buy them either, in spite of the White House ladling out ever more money to make the pricey cars more affordable.    Passing the huge Inflation Reduction Act, which even the liberal Economist admits is a ""misleadingly"" labeled climate bill, is considered a major achievement by the Biden team. The $370 billion bill was passed by Democrats, failing to garner a single GOP vote.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION There’s a reason for that. Bloomberg, an organization all-in on fighting climate change, wrote last summer that the ""price tag"" for the biggest-ever climate bill ""remains mysterious."" Bloomberg’s best guess is that ""the uncapped incentives of the Inflation Reduction Act mean spending… could triple initial estimates and push past $1 trillion.""  Much of the bill’s spending comes in the ""form of tax credits that are uncapped,"" reported Bloomberg; there is ""no restriction on how many businesses or citizens can claim new tax incentives made available to support everything from the purchase of electric vehicles to the production of green hydrogen and assembled-in-America batteries.""  See a problem here? As with the $800 billion Payroll Protection Program funding meant to sustain small businesses during COVID, there will almost certainly be massive spillage. Misused PPP funds went to absurdities like taxpayers footing the bill for Barbra Streisand’s gardener, charged with maintaining her $20 million Malibu mansion.    Already, multiple business in the EV and battery space have collapsed. EV makers Proterra, Lordstown Motors and Electric Last Mile Solutions have all filed for bankruptcy; a dozen more companies are hanging by a thread.    There will be more failures. The government is a terrible judge of possible commercial success and will disburse billions to worthless causes.  Worse, John Podesta, political apparatchik of the Clinton and Obama White Houses, is in charge of handing out the $380 billion-plus of ""green"" money. Watch to see how much money flows to ventures in toss-up states – those which will decide whether Joe Biden gets a second term.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Joe Biden receives higher marks on his handling of climate change than on nearly any other issue; 43% approve in a recent CNN survey, but few voters rank the issue high on their list of priorities.  John Kerry, the jet-setting climate diplomat who was charged with getting other major polluters like China and India to commit to rein in emissions – failed to do that. Turns out those countries prioritize growth and economic success over saving the planet. I wish the Biden White House did the same. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK"

Whether we’re talking about threatening your job with his federal vaccine mandates, or your pocketbook with his illogical climate agenda, or your safety with his open-border policy, the Biden administration is demanding total control over American liberty in favor of central federal control.  Now is the time to push back, and push back hard, to protect our states and local communities from bureaucratic agencies, unelected officials, and federal overreach that threatens not just our pocketbooks but also our way of life.  If you’re still on the fence, thinking this bureaucratic squeeze will eventually relent, I invite you to consider this: with inflation skyrocketing, insurance rates at an all-time high, climbing mortgage rates, and the cost of materials and home maintenance consistently rising, do you want to pay $2,800 more for a water heater?  Or $3,250 more for a gas stove (if you are even permitted to buy one)? When the summer heat hits, do you want to pay $1,100 more for an air conditioner? Or $500 more for a furnace next freeze?  BIDEN ADMIN UNVEILS STRING OF ECO REGULATIONS IN LATEST APPLIANCE CRACKDOWN TARGETING FRIDGES, FREEZERS Well, maybe, if it’s better quality, or more efficient. But it’s not. In the landmark case Louisiana vs. DOE, I challenged Biden’s Department of Energy and its attempt to repeal a Trump-era rule that exempted dishwashers and washing machines from strict water-use standards.  This rule incentivized more efficient products and expanded consumer choice. By repealing it, Americans have dirtier clothes and dishes, forcing us to run a second cycle or wash our clothes by hand – while blowing the family budget.  As a working mother of four boys, I know firsthand this is the opposite of energy efficient. It’s a colossal waste of time, energy and water. Unsurprisingly, the court unequivocally sided with Louisiana and 11 other states, deeming the DOE’s repeal of the Trump-era rule ""arbitrary and capricious.""  The ruling also highlighted the DOE's failure to consider crucial factors such as appliance performance, substitution effects, and evidence revealing that the department's conservation standards were, in fact, causing increased energy and water usage among Americans.  CONSUMER GROUP EXPOSES COSTS OF BIDEN ADMIN'S WAR ON HOME APPLIANCES And despite our win, that same DOE mindset is being applied to all other household appliances to suit Biden’s agenda.  In other words, Joe Biden wants you to pay more for less efficiency while removing any other options that might make more sense for your family and your budget. Even more concerning is the focus Washington, D.C., maintains over household economics by micromanaging your precious time and money.  And by forcing Americans to adopt expensive (and inefficient) technologies to appease climate activists, this administration is simultaneously costing you liberty. In that particular battle, the states are our last line of defense, using the judicial system as a safeguard against tyranny, even if that tyranny reveals itself in dirty dishes, smelly clothes and more time-consuming household duties.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It is imperative that we push back against this administration and enforce the boundaries of the law – even when it’s about air conditioning and refrigerators. That is how we lose ground in this fight: by giving up inch after inch, assuming the climate police will eventually be satisfied or see reason. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. The more we surrender, the more power they gain at the expense of our families and our freedom.  State attorneys general must persist in the fight to safeguard individual liberty and economic freedom.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-want-climate-change-break-border,Democrats want to use climate change to break the border,01/12/2024,America's broken southern border could easily get worse. Two Hill Democrats want to use climate change to bring in refugees and then give them taxpayer-funded benefits.,"America’s borders are being overrun. A record number of suspected terrorists, migrants from special-interest nations, and alarming amounts of deadly fentanyl are crossing our border – and this is still just a fraction of who and what is slipping past law enforcement.   Yet, Democrats want to open our homeland to more and more immigrants, regardless of their countries of origin and motivations for entry, in one of the most radical immigration-related proposals we have seen to date in Washington, D.C.  Two congressional Democrats recently reintroduced the ""Climate Displaced Persons Act,"" which would entitle immigrants who are ""compelled to leave [their] habitual home ... due to a climate-related environmental disaster"" to claim the same American assistance and benefits afforded to refugees.  If enacted into law, this legislation would continue to compromise the future of our nation as our officials progressively incentivize unlimited, and largely unvetted, immigration into the United States.  While this bill isn’t likely to be passed out of Congress any time soon, the policy is championed, and essentially enacted, by executive fiat from the Biden administration. In October 2021, the White House issued its ""Report on the Impact of Climate Change on Migration,"" setting several things into motion on this front.   A December 2023 White House fact sheet highlighting the U.S. Agency for International Development’s ""Climate Strategy"" from April 2022 noted, ""the need to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to climate-related migration and scale support to migrants and their communities.""  The U.S. Department of State also released objectives this past summer, one of which was to, ""strengthen and expand the protection of refugees and migrants in situations of vulnerability affected by climate change.""  These building blocks prove that, regardless of congressional action to codify these immigration enhancements, federal bureaucrats are barnstorming over the rule of law and the Constitution, which is par for the course for this administration, as we have seen time and again.   Many Democrats, including the current commander-in-chief, consider climate change to be the top crisis facing our nation and world. Because of this flawed moral compass, they believe that the ends justify the means, and that our Constitution, laws and national fabric and unity can be jettisoned in the name of responding to this ""crisis.""   This is why they are attempting to introduce these climate change-related pathways into our country. Some consequences from their schemes will be felt immediately, but most will be reserved for future generations of Americans.  There are varying definitions and standards for what constitutes a ""climate change crisis,"" which computes endless possibilities for countries of origin of ""displaced migrants.""   Think of America’s adversaries around the world – especially China, Russia and Iran. Those nations are likely on some ""crisis"" list. Other countries of concern to ours, such as Afghanistan, Syria and South Sudan, are also on the lists.   As relations deteriorate with many countries and regions around the world, do we really want to welcome more immigrants into our country from those troubled areas – solely on the basis and subjective claim that they are fleeing a politically defined crisis? I don’t think so.  The sad reality of the real crisis facing our nation – the lawlessness at America’s southern border – is that we have little room to expand lawful and sensible systems of immigration with the massive influx of illegal immigrants already coming across each year.   In the just-completed fiscal year, almost 2.5 million aliens were encountered at the southern border, beating out the already historic numbers from the previous year. These figures do not take into account the millions of ‘gotaways’ crossing the border and escaping detection under the ‘watchful’ eyes of this administration.   CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Illegal immigrants – and those in our government who aid and abet their actions through lack of enforcement or oversight – are creating an unfair situation for those who may need and deserve entry into the United States more than others.  The United States will always be a nation of immigrants and a country that stands above many others in allowing men, women, and children to shelter within our borders. Our laws demand, though, that immigrants enter our nation through an ordered, legal process.   Our rich history of being the ""Shining City on a Hill"" for countless immigrants also demands that we take care to vet the individuals coming into our country and ensure that the numbers and identities do not compromise the future for our grandchildren.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That’s why I’m fighting against illegal immigration and radical attempts to transform our immigration system with bills such as the Climate Displaced Persons Act.   We must make sure that we enforce our laws and that we do not set up our immigration systems for continued exploitation by people who should not be in our nation. The future of our country depends on the decisions we make on these fronts.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP. DEBBIE LESKO"
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/fossil-fuels-not-enemy-bad-policy-is,"Fossil fuels are not the enemy, bad policy is",01-16-2024,The fossil fuel haters like those who attend U.N. climate conferences ignore the enormous blessings afforded them on account of abundant and affordable energy.,"The global elites once again patted themselves on the back for saving the planet, marking the latest COP28 with an actual commitment to ""transition away"" from fossil fuels. Half the attendees, however, had to settle for less, wanting a complete ""phase out"" instead.  The fossil fuel haters seem to forget, or rather choose to ignore, the enormous blessings afforded them on account of abundant and affordable energy.  Very strong and positive correlations exist between the use of fossil fuels and rise in GDP, income, wealth, life expectancy and overall quality of life, simply because this resource has enabled countless technological advancements.  The greater the access to cheap energy, the greater the overall health and productivity of a nation. The converse is also true. COP28 CLIMATE CONFERENCE IS NOT JUST THE SUPER BOWL OF VIRTUE SIGNALING. IT'S DOING REAL DAMAGE It’s ironic that the very fuel despised by alarmists is the sole energy source that facilitates their annual gatherings to denounce its usage. COP28 attendance peaked at around 85,000 this year, hundreds of whom flew in and out on private jets. More detrimental than anything fossil fuels can do to the environment are the policies so many of our world leaders have enacted to limit their usage.  One of the biggest developments to come out of a COP meeting was 2015’s Paris climate agreement. Over time, it created a net-zero movement, which in part seeks to replace fossil fuels with so-called green energy sources through heavy government subsidization. The results have been destructive and costly. The current administration has done all in its power to curb fossil fuel production and usage: canceled pipelines, drilling moratoriums, delayed permitting, stringent EPA rules, additional fees on oil and gas, plans to shut down coal plants.  Fossil fuels have hovered around 80% of total energy usage for some time; global oil consumption continues to rise. It is not plausible for intermittent wind and solar to rapidly replace reliable fossil fuels. BIDEN ADMIN UNVEILS LATEST CRACKDOWN ON OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AT UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE States with stringent Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) – which require a certain percentage of electricity to be renewable – have often seen the biggest utility rate hikes, up to 50% higher than states without an RPS due to high costs of implementation. North American Electric Reliability Corporation expressed grave concerns in its most recent Long-Term Reliability Assessment, noting that ""environmental regulations that are overly rigid"" can cause electricity shortfalls and put regions at great risk during high demand. The report emphasizes ""reliability to be a top priority for energy policymakers, regulators and industry.""  Nine states already experienced rolling blackouts in December 2022 as the demand for electricity exceeded supply during Winter Storm Elliott. Unreliable renewables fell short. Coal saved the day for this storm and others, including Uri, where the Texas power grid was minutes away from collapse.  Perhaps had fossil fuels not been restricted in the first place, such crises would have been averted. WHITE HOUSE SILENT AS OIL PRODUCTION REACHES RECORD, ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL FOR GREEN ENERGY Attempts are being made to eliminate gas-powered cars by forcing the sale of electric vehicles (EV) through subsidies and mandates. Not only does this maneuver distort markets and cost taxpayers, but it forces reliance on China for critical minerals we refuse to mine here at home. The infrastructure required to adequately charge EVs on a massive scale is also sorely lacking.  Consequently, demand for EVs is not nearly as robust as anticipated, leaving inventory to pile up at dealerships. Consumers are just not sold due to the high costs, limited range, charging anxieties and diminished capacity in cold climates. Automakers have lost billions. Everything is inextricably linked to energy, and any hiccups have massive implications that reverberate throughout the economy.  Net-zero policies are the root cause of today's energy crisis because they have restricted fossil fuel investment, production and transport. This has artificially suppressed supply, leading to high prices and shortages. Inflation hit a 40-year record high while consumer confidence hit severe lows. The anti-fossil fuel agenda may be annually costing the U.S. economy $100 billion. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Such policies are a regressive tax on the poor, who suffer the most. A greater portion of their income is spent on energy, forcing some to choose between buying food and paying a utility bill. The real crime is forbidding fledgling countries the same life-saving technologies and basic luxuries we enjoy by banning them from using fossil fuels. One billion people live without any electricity, often in harsh or dangerous environments. Denying them cheap energy condemns them to a life of poverty and in some cases, is a death sentence.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is estimated that the global spending on just physical assets to attain net zero is $275 trillion between 2021 through 2050, or $9.8 trillion per year. Global GDP for 2022 was roughly $100 trillion.  That’s an astronomical amount of money to thwart global temperatures by a mere fraction of a percent. We should be promoting the use of affordable and reliable energy to spur economic growth and prosperity in ALL nations. Demonizing fossil fuels does more harm than good.

It's time for American businesses to get back to basics",12/01/2024,"Call it DEI, ESG or even just woke, but major corporations telling us how to live is going away. It's the Trump era and companies can feel comfortable working for investors once more.","Horror writer Stephen King once wrote ""sooner or later, everything old is new again."" Since Donald Trump’s reelection, U.S. stock markets and investor confidence have been on a tear. The reason is simple. After a decade of companies apologizing for not being progressive enough on causes ranging from the environment to diversity initiatives to support for Palestine, investors know corporations can once again unapologetically focus on delivering value for shareholders.  The horrors of stakeholder capitalism are finally over.   In 1970, famed economist Milton Friedman wrote that ""there is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.""   STATE LAWMAKERS, COMPANIES PREPARE TO PUSH BACK AGAINST DEI, 'WOKE' INITIATIVES: EXPERTS Over the next 44 years, American business focused on shareholders. Their European counterparts did not. Across the pond, Europeans embraced stakeholder capitalism — which is something of a misnomer, since it isn’t really capitalism at all. It’s a theory, propagated by Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum, that holds that the purpose of a corporation is to maximize value for all stakeholders — community members, activist groups, non-profits, government agencies, etc. — not just shareholders.   American capitalism produced superior stock market returns and broad-based societal gains. The U.S. GDP has grown 16 times since 1975; Europe has grown just 11 times. Per capita income tells a similar story, with U.S. per capita income dwarfing Europe by a ratio of almost 2:1.   But improving people’s fortunes wasn’t enough for many progressive institutions. After the Great Recession, European sovereign wealth funds, Ivy league endowments, blue state pension funds and ESG promoting asset managers like BlackRock demanded American companies earn their social ""license"" by using corporate power to shape society in ways these elite, left-leaning institutions felt wise.  The stakeholder camp was especially emboldened when Trump first took office and pulled out of international agreements like the Paris Climate Agreement and UN Human Rights Council. Business was now supposed to do the work government would not. In response, the Business Roundtable, a group of 200 CEOs of U.S. companies, radically changed the purpose of a corporation in 2019. Now, businesses had a ""fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders,"" not just shareholders alone.   The impact was immediate. American businesses were at the mercy of progressive stakeholder activists that were much noisier than the everyday shareholder.  Oil and gas companies could no longer focus on providing affordable, reliable and abundant energy sources to the American public. Instead, they had to apologize to activist groups for their carbon emissions and construct net-zero goals without concern for what future energy needs might be.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Internet companies could no longer connect social graphs of people online and provide a public square to debate ideas. Now, they were forced to apologize for ""misinformation"" and ""hate speech"" on their platform, the definition of which varied depending on the political cause du jour.  Consumer companies, from beer companies to entertainment powerhouses to retailers could no longer simply advertise their wares. Instead, they had to apologize for not being diverse, equitable, or inclusive (DEI) and bow to organizations like the Human Rights Campaign, which demanded more LGBTQ+ marketing campaigns and gender transition guidelines.    Companies could no longer support the military or the police. Instead, companies began apologizing for their role in perpetuating systemic racism and donating hundreds of millions of dollars to organizations like Black Lives Matter to pay tithes.  But the tides have turned. The aims of stakeholder capitalism to produce maximum returns with maximum societal benefits was fantasy. The outcome was more akin to horror. Companies wasted billions of dollars on stakeholder-favored ESG and DEI programs that didn’t deliver shareholder value, and in many cases, destroyed it. Nor was society any better off. Inflation was high, wage growth was low, and consumer confidence was muted. Society was more polarized than ever heading into the election.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But freedom is in sight. Looking ahead, companies are beginning to unshackle themselves from the burdens of stakeholders. Unpopular programs like ESG and DEI were already on life support prior to Trump’s election. Now the plug is being pulled. Trump signaled that he would eliminate ESG considerations in retirement plans and clamp down on ESG shareholder proposals. Companies like Tractor Supply, Harley-Davidson, Miller-Coors have already eliminated their ESG and DEI programs. And they did so without apology.  Markets are responding favorably. American capitalism is again on the rise. The old ways of doing business are new again. Hopefully, more companies will follow suit. The last thing the stakeholder capitalism horror series needs is a sequel.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANSON FRERICKS"

The Paris climate agreement is an international treaty aimed at limiting global temperature increases to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and committing to net zero emissions by mid-century.  Adopted by 196 parties at the U.N. climate change conference (COP21) in Paris, in December 2015, it went into effect the following November. Participating countries submit their national climate action plans, which should become increasingly ambitious every five years.  THE SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THE ‘CALIFORNICATION’ OF AMERICAN ENERGY POLICY Under our constitutional form of government, treaties are to be ratified by the Senate. President Obama, however, evaded such a review by merely calling it an executive agreement, for it surely would not have received the requisite two-thirds vote. But it is in fact a treaty; even the U.N. calls it such. President Biden simply followed Obama’s footsteps with an executive order to reenter. A proposition of this magnitude deserves critical analysis and examination before enlisting our entire nation as a participant. Foregoing senatorial review undermines an essential component of the Constitution’s checks and balances. The Paris Agreement threatens U.S. ability to self-govern, something most Americans value and cherish. We should not be beholden to the whims of international leaders with political agendas. Our elected officials have responsibilities to their constituents, not U.N. bureaucrats and foreign organizations. TRUMP’S ENERGY AGENDA CAN MAKE AMERICA AFFORDABLE AGAIN U.S. energy policy needs to be derived from legislators who are voted into office by U.S. citizens. The climate accord instead compels our leaders to continually negotiate domestic energy policy with a coalition of external governments and institutions, all demanding that abundant and cheap carbon-based fuels be replaced with expensive and unreliable so-called green energy, namely wind, solar and electric vehicle technology.  Striking at the heart of federalism, individual states are also essentially forced to cede their powers to the president who has taken control of their energy sectors. States should be free to navigate and implement what works best for their energy needs. Several decades of climate policy both here and abroad have taught us a few things regarding the folly of such rash decisions. I KNOW WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP’S ENERGY POLICY WILL BE. I USED TO RUN HIS ENERGY REGULATORY AGENCY Our European friends, who have implemented aggressive net zero policies and endorse the agreement, are experiencing the highest electricity rates in the world, shortages, and even deindustrialization.  Germany’s production peaked in 2017 and has been in a state of decline ever since. High energy costs are often blamed. Britain too is suffering from ill-conceived climate initiatives. Some states in the U.S. who have individually adopted ambitious wind and solar portfolios are also witnessing skyrocketing electricity prices, blackouts and energy shortfalls. The treaty functions on the premise that renewable energy is cheap and reliable, however, it is anything but that. Wind and solar are not low-cost substitutes for fossil fuels, nor can they provide the secure and stable energy Americans expect to run their households and businesses. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The treaty also serves as a transfer of wealth. Rich countries, largely held responsible as the greatest contributors to climate change, are expected to alleviate their guilt by pledging money into a fund that assists developing countries in mitigating its effects. But a severe lack of transparency, loose guidelines and lax reporting on the donated finances are raising questions. Some of the funds have been used for fossil fuel projects, airport extensions, chocolate shops and other economic ventures seemingly unrelated to climate issues. Developing nations ought to be free to utilize the very resources that allowed wealthy countries to flourish. No nation ever became rich without the employment of fossil fuels. We should be partnering with poor countries to facilitate a rise out of poverty rather than further pushing them toward it with demands of a so-called transition to renewables. Energy produced on U.S. soil is also among the cleanest in the world. Restricting production here prompts other nations with lax environmental standards and zero interest in the treaty to ramp up theirs. The effort simply becomes futile.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The agreement assumes that a massive push toward net zero will miraculously slow the rate of global warming, but it will produce no detectable climate benefits. Instead, trillions will have been diverted from productive investments and put toward political purposes. How American consumers power their economy should not be subject to the whims of any foreign entity. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM KRISTEN WALKER"
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/john-kerrys-coal-crusade-condemns-billions-poverty,John Kerry's coal crusade condemns billions to poverty,12-13-2023,"While American diplomats are fearmongering about minuscule temperature changes, billions around the world would rejoice at the opportunity to enjoy reliable electricity.","""Death to coal"" might as well have been John Kerry’s words at the U.N. climate conference, where the Biden administration called for an end to coal-fired power plants not just in America, but the entire world – as if life would be just hunky-dory without access to 36% of our electricity.  While American diplomats are fearmongering about minuscule temperature changes, billions of men, women and children around the world would rejoice at the opportunity to enjoy reliable electricity.  The well-to-do hobnobbing at climate summits may take lights, heat and refrigeration for granted as universal necessities, but in many parts of the world, these are extravagant luxuries reserved only for the richest and most powerful. If Kerry and President Biden get their way, that may be the case in America, too – unless the federal government turns tail and supports the benefits of clean, responsibly produced American coal. BIDENOMICS IS REALLY JUST A PLOY TO DESTROY AMERICAN ENERGY Kerry’s anti-coal comments reveal just how tone-deaf the Biden administration is to the problems of the world, let alone its own constituency. Although you’ll never see it in the headlines, energy poverty may be humanity’s most pressing problem.  Without affordable, reliable energy, nothing about our modern lives is possible – even the most basic necessities like healthy, nutrient-dense foods and life-saving medications. For the billions around the world without electricity, or only sporadic power, this is no political issue. It’s a matter of life and death.  Just picture life in South Sudan, Burundi or Malawi – where less than 15% have any electricity at all, let alone constant power – where life expectancies barely breach 60 and 10% of children die before the age of 5. Life without electricity – for which coal is essential – is brutal and short. But don’t think this problem is limited to far-flung Third World nations. In England, more than 3,000 people die needlessly every year because they can’t afford to keep their homes at a safe temperature in the winter. For all the hype and lies about global warming from the likes of Hillary Clinton, global mortality data shows cold is nearly 10 times deadlier than heat, claiming 4.5 million lives a year on average. TRUMP BLASTS KERRY'S CLIMATE ACTIVISM FOR ‘DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY’ IN IOWA TOWN HALL: ‘HE HAS TO BE STOPPED’ Of course, Kerry’s anti-coal comments aren’t driven by humanitarian concerns. As Biden’s ""special envoy for climate change,"" his mission is singular. But even if the environment is your top concern, coal shouldn’t be our nemesis – China should be. In fact, we’re seeing a significant increase in use of coal around the globe, much of it by China and India, where pollution control technology is lacking. It’s not uncommon in major cities in Asia to see pedestrians wearing masks not because of COVID-19, but because of toxic air. Highways and airports are routinely closed in China due to smog so thick drivers and pilots can’t see, and respiratory illnesses are through the roof. ""I could actually taste the air when I breathed,"" remarked one traveler.  But the United States, where a quarter of our electricity comes from coal, is a world leader in clean air, with air pollution plummeting almost 80% since 1970. We’re ranked number one in the world for access to clean and safe drinking water.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION As a global powerhouse in fossil fuel production, America has proven that affordable, reliable energy and environmental protection go hand in hand. And when it comes to warming, Kerry still needn’t fret about coal. The Earth is in an ""interglacial period,"" which is a normal period of warmer than usual temperatures spanning every 10-15,000 years. Each of the last four interglacial periods were considerably hotter than today’s temperatures.  Temperatures have risen slightly since the Industrial Revolution, but a new study covering 42,000 years of historical weather actually shows that manmade greenhouse gas emissions are simply not strong enough to affect global temperatures. And while temperatures have warmed slightly, regardless of cause, human resilience to our climate has risen dramatically.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Attacking coal may be politically convenient, but it’s scientifically fruitless — especially as Biden continues to push electric vehicles, which will astronomically increase our electricity needs. With a quarter of Americans reporting difficulty affording their home energy bills – according to data collected before three years of record inflation – this is not the time to vilify coal.  Instead, the United States should embrace our cutting-edge pollution control technology and boldly support the affordable, reliable fuels that make modern life possible, fossil fuels and nuclear energy.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/left-all-out-war-american-energy-too-late-reverse-course,The Left's all-out war on American energy. Is it too late to reverse course?,12-15-2023,"We live in a country that demonizes the very same energy that got us here, and we accept energy limits and so-called “clean energy"" that falls far short of its intended goal.","Energy is the driving force behind the American Dream, and it is the reason that dream feels so far away right now.  For generations, the United States was a leader in energy production, and through that momentum we dreamed big and built up an automotive industry that shocked the world. There was no stopping American motorized ingenuity, and it was because of American energy.  Today, we live in a country that demonizes the very same energy that got us here, and we accept a society that mandates energy limits and requires so-called ""clean energy"" that falls far short of its intended goal.  This has led to a dramatic and tragic reality where Big Government swings its hammer at the private sector, which is particularly evident in the automobile industry.  SOME DEMOCRATS JOIN REPUBLICANS IN VOTING TO STRIKE DOWN BIDEN'S EV MANDATE The recent UAW strike against the Big Three auto manufacturers will have a long and lasting impact on our national economy, but its hidden truth is rooted in bad energy policy that was left for consumers and union workers to deal with. The president and Democrats will deny this reality, but the facts do not lie. In 2021, President Biden outlined a plan to make 50% of all vehicles EVs by 2030. This was an all-out attack on automakers because their best-selling vehicles are all gas-powered.  The Ford F150, Chevy Silverado and Ram Pickup are not just popular gas-powered vehicles, they are the three most purchased vehicles in the country. To slap a mandate on that, in essence, tells automakers that their national bestsellers need to become EVs, which is a death sentence for their business. NEW REPORT UNMASKS TRUE COSTS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATES: ‘REMAIN MORE EXPENSIVE’ As we saw with Ford last year, they lost over $4 billion in revenue due to EVs. That loss is then transferred to the workers, because regardless of the impact to the bottom line, they still must go along with Biden’s ridiculous plan. That means less revenue, less production and fewer workers. It is not all that hard to do the math. To make matters worse for autoworkers and automakers, Biden’s push for EVs bolsters our reliance on China. It seems that selling out to the Green New Deal agenda comes with a CCP battery and the closure of American production plants. It may sound like a stretch, but again, the facts do not lie.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Ninety percent of the supply chain that provides batteries for EVs is reliant upon China, and 75% of the critical minerals needed to produce EV batteries – lithium, nickel, manganese, cobalt, graphite – are controlled by China. When it comes to global battery cell production, China claims 76% control.  When we look to the future, things do not get better. The United States has just 7% of global battery production capacity, with forecasts for coming years showing signs of little to no growth. On the other hand, by 2032, China is estimated to control 67% of all battery cell manufacturing.  These markers are beyond troubling. They show a pattern of under-production and over-reliance. Yet, for whatever reason, the Biden administration refuses to see what is in plain sight.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Instead, they push a false Green New Deal agenda over American energy independence that has resulted in an exponential decline of the American economy. This rings especially true for automakers, and the UAW strike was clear evidence.  But more than that, on a larger scale we are witness to an all-out war on American energy that will be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse if we do not act soon.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP LISA MCCLAIN"

But in a new report that serves as a devastating blow to Gov.

Ultimately, New York's shifting timelines reflect poorly on the state.  The bottom line: New York's lofty climate goals are little more than political posturing and an embrace of a ""rules for thee, but not for me"" mindset.

That's the only logical takeaway from a recent CNN headline that informs us that the ""World's first carbon tax on livestock will cost farmers $100 per cow.""  I don't usually pay too much attention to Looney Tune ideas from across the Atlantic, but this is the kind of craziness that migrates across the ocean to these shores.  SOLAR COMPANY FOUND TO HAVE ‘REAPED BILLIONS’ FROM TOP BIDEN LAW LEADS TO OUTCRY: ‘APPEASING THE RICH’ Denmark's $96-a-cow tax is to be imposed ""for the planet-heating emissions they generate.""  If you are wondering why cows are suddenly supervillains, you aren't paying attention to the extremists running the environmental movement.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen boasts that ""we are investing billions"" in this transition to a carbon-free society. Sounds like he's angling for a Nobel Prize. The cows are collateral damage in this crusade to save the planet from heat waves.   CNN says the global food system contributes one-third of the greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere.  PBS says it's worse than that. It finds that ""cows and other livestock animals are responsible for about 40 percent of methane emissions — a potent greenhouse gas.

More taxes on cows means fewer cattle. That's the idea here.  So why do we tax work, saving and investment?

But apparently cows we can live without. They aren't cute and cuddly enough. So much for ""biodiversity.""  Where is this all headed?

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/stranded-ev-midnight-progressives-want-know-nightmare,I was stranded in an EV at midnight. Progressives don't want you to know about my nightmare,01-23-2024,The push by Biden and Democrats to clean energy is strongly focused on EVs (electric vehicles). But the utopian future envisioned by progressives is really a nightmare scenario.,"It only takes a weekend trip to a wedding two hours outside of a big city to realize this country is nowhere near ready for the Democrats' clean energy revolution. It’s too bad they’re unwilling to accept reality.  Democrats are pushing us toward an America powered by wind, solar, and other green alternatives to gas, oil, and coal. It makes us more reliant on electricity. But as I detail in my book ""What’s Killing America: Inside the Radical Left’s Tragic Destruction of Our Cities"", the eco-reality favored by the Left is lightyears ahead of our reality.  A major piece of the Democrats’ clean energy revolution is a mandate towards electric vehicles (EVs). At least 13 states, including Washington, California, New York, and Virginia, plus D.C., mandate new car sales to be EVs by 2035. The goal is to convert everyone to electric -- by force. But to date, the country only has 168,426 charging stations, with a goal of 500,000 by 2025. A lot of good that will do. The International Council on Clean Transportation says the U.S. will require 2.4 million charging stations by 2030 (which includes at-home, public, and workplace) based on EV market trends. BIDEN'S EV INSANITY JUST GOT EVEN WORSE Last week, Hertz rental cars made headlines for ditching its EV fleet for more gas-powered vehicles. I lived their reason, learning a harsh lesson about our weak EV infrastructure while driving to a wedding in Cle Elum, 90 minutes east of Seattle. I don’t own a car, so I rented one from Hertz. I was dubious of the EV they gave me, but I had no choice: they rented out the gas-powered car that I reserved and I was out of options.  As I drove to the wedding venue, I was nearly glued to the dashboard, watching a dwindling battery percentage. Just when I thought everything would be OK, I encountered hills. EV batteries do not like hills.  When I arrived at the venue, my dashboard said the battery would only last 43 more miles. I needed double that to make it back to Seattle. From the vows to the post-ceremony dinner, I was panicked, downloading apps that mapped out the nearest EV power stations, hoping I could make this work. EVS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS RELIABLE THAN GAS-ENGINE CARS, CONSUMER REPORTS FINDS There was a nearby EV plug-in location with a dozen open spaces -- for Teslas. I wasn’t driving a Tesla. Without a standard EV plug, if you don’t have an adapter, you’re out of luck. The closest location compatible with my car was a diner in the middle of nowhere, 30 miles away.  I nervously headed out, watching the battery react to every hill, and every press of the gas pedal. The car misled me about how far I’d get. After 30 minutes, I had 9.5 miles to the charger and a battery that could handle 17 more miles.  WINTER WEATHER PRESENTING EV OWNERS WITH 'FRUSTRATING' CHALLENGES Pro-tip: when driving an EV, do not make any mistakes -- like missing a poorly lit off-ramp to your plug-in station on a highway where the next opportunity to get off and head back is two miles away (and two miles back), when your battery has only about one mile left to give. I was forced to pull over, cruising to a stop in the middle of nowhere. The battery had died as I was pulling off the freeway. Moments later, the lights and heat went out. It was pitch black and about 30 degrees.  I don’t know if you’ve ever tried getting a tow truck to pick you up in the middle of nowhere, but it turns out they will accept your business, quote you $300, and say they’ll pick you up in 20 minutes only to tell you 45 minutes later that they are canceling.  After two hours of mostly yelling at Hertz customer service and cursing the lack of EV infrastructure in the state, I got an Uber after two hours of waiting. A driver named Hussein took pity on me and agreed to pick me up. He couldn’t arrive soon enough. My cell phone battery hit 13%, and, as with my EV, I had nowhere to plug it in. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION When the Uber arrived, I abandoned the EV. It was now Hertz’s problem. I got home, $108.91 later (plus a generous tip). This is your future in the Democrats’ EV world. In Washington state, relatively straightforward transit projects take years and are always over budget. Does anyone think any state can install the hundreds of thousands of charging stations needed for an hours-long ride? Even the large urban areas with Democrat-controlled government aren’t installing charging stations at large scale. And can we even afford it? Washington State is spending $41 million to install just over 180 charging stations. As of September 23, the state only had 1,820 charging stations. Is the technology advanced enough that the current charging stations, with clunky and heavy plugs, will not need a major upgrade within the next decade? We’d better start embracing staycations because road trips are out of the question. Forget long drives to see medical specialists. And you better not forget to plug in each night or you’ll find yourself without a battery juice when driving home from work.  The battery technology isn’t where it needs to be to make EVs worthwhile, and the prices aren’t low enough for most families to comfortably purchase (you can thank Bidenomics for that). Yet Democrats continue to force EVs on us.  Even if the infrastructure existed, our power grids couldn’t handle it.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Temperatures in Washington state hit historic lows this month and our power grid wasn’t prepared. As temperatures dropped to 17 in Seattle, Puget Sound Energy, the state’s largest supplier of electricity and natural gas, asked customers to lower their thermostats and limit the use of hot water to ""reduce strain on the grid."" Our grid couldn’t handle a weekend of below-normal temperatures. But we should expect it’ll handle a near future of EVs? Heaven forbid it get cold when our cars are plugged in.

The 120 GOP lawmakers — led by Sens. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich. — penned a letter late Tuesday to the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), warning that its corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards proposed in July would raise costs, restrict consumer choice, harm businesses and degrade both U.S. energy and national security. ""We strongly urge NHTSA to withdraw its misguided proposal, go back to the drawing board and reissue new CAFE standards that comply with the law, rather than ones that seek to pick winners and losers in the free market and remake our country’s economy,"" they wrote to NHTSA Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman.  ""Nowhere in law did Congress authorize NHTSA to set fuel economy standards that effectively mandate EVs while at the same time force the internal combustion engine out of the market,"" the letter continued. ""In fact, federal statute expressly prohibits NHTSA from considering the fuel economy of EVs when determining maximum feasible CAFE standards for passenger cars and trucks."" 17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH The letter added that, despite a clear statutory limitation prohibiting NHTSA from factoring the fuel economy of EVs into its CAFE standard regulations, the Biden administration accounted for EVs in its ""regulatory baseline"" and factored that baseline into its determination of the maximum achievable CAFE standards. The proposal, therefore, effectively requires the mass production of EVs, they said. The Republicans argued the NHTSA should set market-driven standards that promote competition among various technologies, not standards that ""limit availability of and access to vehicle and fuel options."" They also noted that EV production has a sizable carbon footprint, a fact not factored into the administration's rulemaking. MORE THAN 3,000 AUTO DEALERS SIGN LETTER OPPOSING BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE ""NHTSA’s out-of-touch de facto EV mandate ignores the reality that most Americans still prefer the internal combustion engine vehicle, and the fact there is a lack of consumer demand for EVs,"" the Republicans' letter added. ""The low consumer demand for EVs can likely be attributed to the various unappealing aspects of these vehicles, including the typically higher sticker prices and insurance premiums, shorter average driving ranges, lower resale value, inadequate battery technologies for severe cold weather and lack of operational charging infrastructure, particularly for drivers in rural areas,"" they wrote. ""EVs are not a practical option for most Americans."" NHTSA's proposed CAFE standards, which the Biden administration argued would help combat climate change and save Americans money, require passenger cars and light trucks to improve fuel efficiency by 2% and 4%, respectively, beginning in 2027. Under the rules, pickup trucks and work vans must boost fuel efficiency 10% every year starting in 2030. By 2032, the agency said, average U.S. fleet fuel economy could reach 58 miles per gallon. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the estimated average fuel economy for model year 2022 cars was 26.4 miles per gallon, meaning the proposed standards would mandate automakers to more than double fuel efficiency in less than a decade or face substantial penalties. VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS UPHOLD STATE'S EV MANDATE DESPITE GROWING OPPOSITION: 'DEFY COMMON SENSE' In a comment letter submitted to NHTSA late last year, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents several major automakers, said companies will pay more than $14 billion in non-compliance penalties under the proposal, impacting one in every two light trucks in 2027-2032 and one in every three passenger cars in 2027-2029.  Overall, car prices are expected to increase by thousands of dollars as a result, simultaneously driving up the average age of vehicles on our roads and forcing consumers to choose EVs. Additionally, the Republicans warned the NHTSA's proposal would benefit China while harming U.S. national security interests, noting that Chinese industry largely dominates EV supply chains. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), for example, China produces about 75% of all lithium-ion batteries, a key component of EVs, worldwide.  China also boasts 70% of production capacity for cathodes and 85% for anodes, two key parts of EV batteries. And more than 50% of lithium, cobalt and graphite processing and refining capacity — which is vital for EV batteries — is located in China, the IEA data showed. HOUSE JOINS SENATE, STRIKES DOWN BIDEN EV CHARGER RULE PROTECTING CHINESE COMPANIES ""NHTSA’s proposed CAFE standards are just the latest attempt by the Biden administration to implement a de facto EV mandate,"" Walberg told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""These standards will limit consumer choice, increase costs and make us reliant on adversaries like China. ""Instead of again pursuing unaffordable central planning, the Biden administration should let innovation and consumers lead us into the future,"" the Michigan Republican continued. ""Whatever that future looks like, it should not be mandated by bureaucrats in Washington."" Walberg and fellow Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., introduced the Choice in Automobile Retail Sales (CARS) Act last year, which would block regulations proposed in April by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) significantly increasing tailpipe emissions standards for gas-powered cars. The House passed that legislation in December, but a companion bill introduced by Crapo has yet to receive a floor vote. Republicans and energy industry groups have argued that, together, the EPA proposal and the NHTSA regulations targeted in the lawmakers' letter Tuesday are designed to push EVs on Americans. An estimated 8% of total vehicle sales were EVs in the third quarter of 2023, according to a Cox Automotive analysis. ""NHTSA’s proposal, combined with EPA’s proposed tailpipe emissions standards, would result in a de facto ban on the sale of new vehicles using gasoline and other liquid fuels,"" said American Petroleum Institute Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy Officer Amanda Eversole. ""These rules will hurt consumers through potentially higher costs, fewer options and increased reliance on unstable foreign supply chains,"" Eversole added. ""We welcome the efforts of senators Crapo and Cruz, along with those of Representative Walberg, to protect American consumers’ access to all affordable and reliable vehicle options."" MAINE FORCED TO DELAY VOTE ON EV MANDATE AMID WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES In addition to the American Petroleum Institute, the nation's largest fossil fuel lobby group, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) has argued against regulations aimed at increasing EV sales. ""The Biden administration is overseeing a whole-of-government campaign to effectively ban new gas, diesel and flex fuel vehicles,"" AFPM President and CEO Chet Thompson said in a statement. ""This agenda is bad for American families, bad for our economy and indefensible from a national security perspective. ""AFPM supports efforts to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation and improve vehicle performance and efficiency for consumers,"" he continued. ""And unlike the Biden administration’s CAFE proposal, we believe successful, consumer-first policies must encourage real competition among all technologies and powertrains, including American-made, American-grown fuels."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thompson also echoed Republicans, arguing that NHTSA and EPA lack congressional authorization to ""regulate internal combustion engine vehicles out of the market."" NHTSA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., voted against a bipartisan bill that would streamline the federal permitting process for nuclear energy development. The House passed the so-called Atomic Energy Advancement Act — which was authored by Reps. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., and Diana DeGette, D-Colo. — in a 365-36 vote Wednesday evening, with 199 Republicans and 166 Democrats voting in favor. However, all 36 nay votes were cast by progressive Democrats who have pushed green energy and, in the case of Ocasio-Cortez, pushed the Green New Deal. ""Nuclear power delivers reliable, affordable, and clean energy to all Americans,"" Duncan said in a statement after the vote. ""With America’s electrical grid powering hospitals, military bases, homes, and businesses, we must build up reliable, dispatchable energy resources that bolster American nuclear independence to keep the power on for Americans and safeguard national security through energy security."" ""Tackling the climate crisis means we must modernize our approach to all clean energy sources, including nuclear,"" DeGette added. ""From enhancing our energy supply chain to recruiting a highly trained and skilled workforce, this bill makes critical updates to improve safety and ensure our nuclear regulations are up-to-date, pushing us closer to a carbon-free energy future."" TIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN'S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM DeGette further stated that nuclear energy must be a ""part of the mix"" if the U.S. is to achieve goals of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, despite nuclear's low carbon footprint, Ocasio-Cortez and other prominent Democrats, like Reps. Cori Bush, Jared Huffman, Pramila Jayapal, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Jamie Raskin and Rashida Tlaib, who have argued for a rapid transition from fossil fuels to green energy, voted against it.

""And in transitioning to a clean economy, we can create millions of jobs in construction, manufacturing, education, engineering and beyond."" The Atomic Energy Advancement Act, would require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to include efficient permitting as part of its mission, mandate that the agency provides efficient, timely and predictable reviews and proceedings for nuclear projects, reduce fees for nuclear developers, modernize environmental reviews for nuclear projects and broadly include nuclear in strategic energy policy.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/appeals-court-delivers-fatal-blow-california-city-pushing-natural-gas-ban,Appeals court delivers fatal blow to California city pushing natural gas ban,01/02/2024,"A federal appeals panel handed a fatal blow to an ordinance passed by the City of Berkeley, California, that would have banned new natural gas hookups in buildings.","A federal appeals court rejected a petition Tuesday to rehear a case related to a natural gas ban proposed by the City of Berkeley, California, which the panel ruled was illegal last year. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ultimately denied Berkeley's petition for rehearing en banc — a motion that received support from the Biden administration, Democratic-led states and environmentalists — after it failed to receive majority support from the court's non-recused active judges. Berkeley filed the motion last year after the court in April that a Berkeley law banning natural gas pipes in new construction violated federal statute. Following the panel's filing Tuesday, the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), which had argued Berkeley's law was illegal, applauded the court for ensuring consumer choice. ""Naturally, AHRI and particularly our member companies that manufacture products and equipment that use natural gas, are very pleased that the full court denied Berkeley’s appeal, thereby allowing the residents of Berkeley, and likely elsewhere, to continue to have choices with respect to energy sources for home and water heating,"" AHRI President and CEO Stephen Yurek said in a statement. BIDEN ADMIN UNVEILS STRING OF ECO REGULATIONS IN LATEST APPLIANCE CRACKDOWN TARGETING FRIDGES, FREEZERS ""We look forward to continuing to work with states and localities to formulate solutions that help them meet their energy conservation and emission reduction goals without unduly impacting consumer health, safety, comfort, and productivity,"" Yurek added. In July 2019, Berkeley's city council passed the ban which was set to go into effect in January 2020, making the city the first in the nation to approve such a measure. Berkeley Councilwoman Kate Harrison, who authored the legislation, said at the time that it was part of the city's effort to take ""more drastic action"" on climate change and curb greenhouse gas emissions. BIDEN ADMIN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TARGETING HOME APPLIANCES WITH ECO REGULATIONS IN 2023 However, months after it was approved, the California Restaurant Association (CRA) filed a federal lawsuit challenging the city's ability to pass a law banning new natural gas hookups. After a lower court ruled in favor of Berkeley in July 2021, the CRA filed an appeal, leading to the Ninth Circuit ruling in April. The Ninth Circuit concluded that Berkeley's law violated the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975, which prevents local regulations from impacting the energy use of natural gas appliances. ""Instead of directly banning those appliances in new buildings, Berkeley took a more circuitous route to the same result,"" Judge Patrick Bumatay wrote in the opinion of the court. ""It enacted a building code that prohibits natural gas piping into those buildings, rendering the gas appliances useless."" ""In sum, Berkeley can’t bypass preemption by banning natural gas piping within buildings rather than banning natural gas products themselves,"" he continued in the ruling. ""EPCA thus preempts the Ordinance’s effect on covered products."" BIDEN ADMIN AIMS TO PUSH TOWNS, CITIES TO ADOPT GREEN ENERGY BUILDING CODES: 'VERY SUSPICIOUS' CRA President and CEO Jot Condie said at the time that Berkeley's attempt to ban natural gas hookups was ""an overreaching measure beyond the scope of any city."" After Berkeley then filed its petition for rehearing, the Department of Justice (DOJ) in June filed an amicus brief in support of the city's gas hookup ban.  ""The panel opinion in this case upended those settled expectations. It held that a particular municipal ordinance addressing a health and safety concern identified by local elected leaders is preempted by the Act — even though the ordinance does not regulate the energy efficiency, energy use, or water use of a covered product,"" the DOJ stated in the brief. ""The ordinance prohibits the installation of certain energy infrastructure in new construction,"" it continued. ""It thereby affects, indirectly, the circumstances in which some products may be used in some locations. The panel did not explain why this ordinance’s indirect effects warranted preemption or why other health and safety ordinances would not."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The case has drawn the attention of industry groups that supported CRA — including the American Gas Association and AHRI — and environmental groups and other jurisdictions across the country that supported Berkeley's ordinance, including the National League of Cities, California, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Washington, D.C., and New York City."

The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Division of Trading and Markets said in a filing Wednesday that it had withdrawn the proposal which would have allowed a new type of public company, so-called Natural Asset Companies (NACs), to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). NACs are a type of company that is chartered to ""protect, restore and grow the natural assets,"" according to the Intrinsic Exchange Group, a non-profit which collaborated with the NYSE to develop the new corporate taxonomy. The Rockefeller Foundation, a left-wing non-profit and an early supporter of Intrinsic Exchange Group's efforts, said the proposal would help combat climate change. ""Of all the objectionable and extreme policies in the ESG menagerie, NACs are among the most egregious and least defensible legally,"" Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes previously told Fox News Digital. ""Not only do NACs suffer the same deficiencies as other ESG investments, but they represent a host of additional dangers to the American public."" Earlier this month, Reyes and Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach led a coalition of 25 state attorneys general in penning a comment letter opposing the SEC's proposal. They argued NACs may pose a threat to national security and subordinate the interests of millions of Americans ""to the aims of environmental activists as well as to United Nations policies and mandates."" INTERNAL EMAILS SHOW SEC COORDINATED CLIMATE DISCLOSURE RULES WITH AI FIRM SET TO FINANCIALLY BENEFIT That comment letter came less than a month after the SEC agreed to delay its rulemaking on the issue and allow stakeholders more time to weigh in on the proposal. The delay was requested by Republican state financial officers from 22 states who requested a ""reasonable public comment process,"" instead of a rushed process. BIDEN ADMIN APPEARS TO FABRICATE PAPER TRAIL IN PURSUIT OF MAJOR CHEMICAL PLANT SHUTDOWN: COURT DOCS ""While masquerading as a novel tool for the public good, NACs are a brutish vehicle to accomplish an activist political agenda,"" the attorney general added. ""They deprive public use of land in multiple ways that will further jeopardize U.S. energy independence and grid stability while illegally opening management, use and ownership of these lands to private parties, including hostile countries or entities."" ""Most notably, the proposed rule would allow private investment interests to control and manage national parks and other publicly owned lands — an unprecedented power-grab and usurpation of federal authority,"" they continued. ""This possibility is alarming, but, when coupled with the proposal’s arbitrary designations and ill-defined terms, it may prove calamitous to the statutory multiple-use mandates of federal lands and responsible development of America’s natural resources."" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Republicans and experts have further warned that activity on federal lands controlled by NACs may be ""determined by the whims of eco-activists"" rather than Congress or government scientists. And they said NACs could lead to the offshoring of energy production to countries with poor human rights and environmental records while opening the door to foreign ownership of public property. However, environmentalists have lobbied for the federal government to open lands up for conservation purposes, a move the Bureau of Land Management is actively pursuing and which would align with the SEC's NAC proposal.  According to NYSE — which argues that NACs ""capture the intrinsic and productive value of nature and provide a store of value based on the vital assets that underpin our entire economy and make life on earth possible"" — natural assets that could be grouped into a NAC include forests, wetlands and coral reefs, as well as working lands such as farms. And last week, House Republicans, led by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., opened an investigation into the SEC's rulemaking process related to NACs. ""The Committee is deeply concerned with the potential impact NACs may have on the management of federal lands, effective conservation of wildlife habitat, and responsible development of natural resources,"" the Republicans wrote to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and Haoxiang Zhu, the director of the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets."

In stunning testimony late last year, Michael Morton — who serves as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 6 science liaison to the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) in Washington, D.C. — admitted that he didn't author a key July 2021 email sent from his email address. That email called off a scientific review of health risks associated with chloroprene emissions which are at the center of an ongoing federal lawsuit with vast economic implications. ""I didn't write that,"" Morton told lawyers for synthetics manufacturer Denka Performance Elastomer (DPE) during a deposition in November. ""I didn't say that. For – for that part, I didn't – I don't know that, so I don't know who wrote that,"" he added when pressed on the email. Morton's testimony and revelations from additional information made public in recent months may ultimately derail the Biden administration's lawsuit against DPE which, if successful, could threaten the future operations of the company's major manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, and further set a precedent broadly threatening the multi-billion-dollar U.S. petrochemical industry.  REPUBLICAN STATE SUES BIDEN ADMIN OVER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ACTIONS: 'DYSTOPIAN NIGHTMARE' In February 2023, the Department of Justice filed a federal lawsuit against DPE on behalf of EPA, seeking to compel the chemical maker's LaPlace facility — the so-called Pontchartrain Works Site which represents the only U.S. plant to produce neoprene, a synthetic rubber common in military equipment, wetsuits and medical technology — to reduce emissions of chloroprene. Chloroprene is a liquid raw material emitted during neoprene manufacturing. According to the lawsuit, the plant's emissions pose a cancer risk to residents in Saint John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, and therefore present an ""imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare."" WHITE HOUSE SILENT AS OIL PRODUCTION REACHES RECORD, ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL FOR GREEN ENERGY ""When I visited Saint John the Baptist Parish during my first Journey to Justice tour, I pledged to the community that EPA would take strong action to protect the health and safety of families from harmful chloroprene emissions from the Denka facility,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said after the lawsuit was filed, adding that DPE hasn't ""moved far enough or fast enough"" to reduce emissions. Less than one month later, the Justice Department filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the case, essentially asking the court to enforce a shutdown of DPE's neoprene facility if the company failed to immediately implement substantial emissions reductions. Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim said the motion ""shows our determination to address environmental justice concerns."" DPE said in a response motion months later that the federal government's actions are ""tantamount to a shutdown order that would have catastrophic consequences for DPE,"" adding that it would lead to ""complete loss of revenue streams, substantial loss of work force, supply chain disruptions and contractual impacts, and regulatory challenges."" The company also characterized the Biden administration's efforts against it as politically driven, unsupported by real-world science, and outside its legal authority under the Clean Air Act. DPE pointed to how its LaPlace facility has sharply curbed its chloroprene emissions and complied with environmental permits. DPE also pointed to Louisiana Tumor Registry data showing that St. John the Baptist Parish, the region where its neoprene facility is located, has recorded one of the lowest cancer rates of any region in the state. ALASKAN NATIVE AMERICANS UNLEASH ON BIDEN ADMIN'S CLIMATE AGENDA: 'COMMUNITIES AND CULTURE ARE AT RISK' And, notably, DPE has criticized EPA for basing its lawsuit largely on a study the agency published in 2010 concluding chloroprene is ""likely to be carcinogenic to humans."" That study, which itself cites 25-year-old studies of female mice, led to the strict emissions standard of 0.2 micrograms of chloroprene per cubic meter air that the EPA is seeking to enforce on DPE's facility in LaPlace. DPE and Lousiana lawmakers have for years sought EPA action to reassess that tight standard, arguing in favor of additional study and scientific review, arguing the 2010 study overestimated chloroprene's cancer risk to humans. The EPA appeared to relent in April 2021 when its Region 6 branch based in Texas, but covering Louisiana and other southern states, nominated chloroprene for a review to revisit its assessment of the chemical's health risks. But EPA's ORD office eventually refused to pursue the review, citing the July 2021 email from Morton, the Region 6 science liaison who recently testified he didn't pen that email. ""We continue to seek additional chloroprene emission reductions from the DPE facility in LaPlace, Louisiana in order to continue to reduce the risks that chloroprene emissions from the DPE facility present to the surrounding community,"" read Morton's email, which was sent to senior EPA ORD official Kris Thayer. ""The cancer inhalation risk estimate is among the factors that the EPA and Louisiana DEQ are using to determine the extent of additional emission reductions needed from the DPE facility,"" it concluded. TOP HOUSE COMMITTEE PROBES JOHN KERRY'S COORDINATION WITH ECO GROUPS PUSHING COAL POWER SHUTDOWN In addition to Morton's testimony, DPE counsel submitted in court filings metadata of his email showing it was originally authored by ORD officials. The revelations suggest that, to walk back the nomination of chloroprene, ORD cited an email purportedly from Region 6, but which it appears to have actually crafted and sent to itself using Morton's email address.  If EPA had moved forward with the nomination of chloroprene and engaged with new research, though, its eventual lawsuit targeting DPE's LaPlace facility may have been derailed. EPA declined to comment, citing its policy against commenting on pending litigation.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Overall, the multi-billion-dollar petrochemical industry in Louisiana is a key driver of jobs and investment in the state. The industry is also a central reason why the state is the third-largest consumer of petroleum and largest consumer of petroleum per capita in the nation, according to the Energy Information Administration. However, the petrochemical industry has long been target of environmentalists who argue it is responsible for harmful emissions and pollution negatively impacting surrounding communities' health."

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in a joint announcement with the White House, said it had selected 67 applicants to receive approximately $965 million to purchase electric and low-emission school buses. The funding means the agency has now awarded nearly $2 billion for thousands of new buses across hundreds of school districts under its Clean School Bus Program, which was created in late 2021. ""As part of our work to tackle the climate crisis, the historic funding we are announcing today is an investment in our children, their health, and their education,"" Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement. ""It also strengthens our economy by investing in American manufacturing and America’s workforce."" ""Today we’re once again accelerating the transition to electric and low-emission school buses in America, helping to secure a healthier future where all our children can breathe cleaner air,"" added EPA Administrator Michael Regan. ""Thanks to President Biden’s historic investments in America, thousands more school buses will hit the road in school districts across the country, saving school districts money and improving air quality at the same time."" BIDEN ADMIN APPEARS TO FABRICATE PAPER TRAIL IN PURSUIT OF MAJOR CHEMICAL PLANT SHUTDOWN: COURT DOCS The grants unveiled Monday will help selected applicants purchase more than 2,700 electric or low-emissions school buses in 280 school districts serving more than 7 million students across 37 states, according to EPA. Those awards come a year after the EPA awarded more than $875 million to 2022 applicants under the program, funding the replacement of 2,366 buses at 372 school districts. The Clean School Bus Program was created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which President Biden signed into law in November 2021. The legislation provides a total of $5 billion in federal grants through 2026 to replace existing diesel-powered school buses nationwide. The agency has projected the program will fund thousands of new electric school buses. CLIMATE ACTIVISTS WHO CHASED BUTTIGIEG, POWELL OFF STAGES REWARDED WITH PRIVATE WHITE HOUSE MEETING ""I led the Bipartisan Infrastructure & Jobs Law to passage so communities across the country will have the federal funding needed to combat climate change, and now, for the second year in a row, this major investment sets the wheels in motion to put new electric school buses on the road, curbing carbon emissions, decreasing pollution, and improving the air quality for students and communities across America,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. However, the EPA Office of Inspector General in late December published the findings of an audit which determined that the Clean School Bus Program was largely dependent on utility companies' ability to increase power supplies. Further, the program may also face significant delays, according to the inspector general, without construction of additional charging stations. Entities interviewed by the inspector general's office specifically expressed concern about the ability of utility providers to bring power lines and transformers to school districts with electric buses. While some power providers have experience with electric bus infrastructure, they said they had never built such infrastructure at scale. Establishing charging stations and connecting them to the regional power grid could take as much as two years, according to the report. Additionally, bus charging stations that are expected to support more than 25 buses in larger school districts face other challenges since they require different technology.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Agency may be unable to effectively achieve program goals unless it can ensure that school districts will be able to establish the infrastructure necessary to support clean bus and charging purchases,"" the EPA inspector general concluded. ""There could be delays in utilities constructing the needed charging stations to make the buses fully operational in a timely manner."" ""While early coordination with utilities is not a requirement, it could prevent the Agency from achieving its objective to remove older diesel buses and replace them with clean buses,"" the report continued. ""The increased demand on manufacturers and utility companies may impact the timeliness of replacing diesel buses and ultimately may delay program health and environmental benefits."""

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced the final rules, which it projected will collectively save American households $2.2 billion per year on utility bills while reducing nearly 71 million metric tons of ""dangerous carbon dioxide emissions"" over the next three decades. DOE's regulations targeting the popular home appliances are slightly scaled down compared to the agency's draft proposal issued a year ago. ""For decades, DOE’s appliance standards actions for clothes washers and dryers have provided loads of savings for American families while also decreasing harmful carbon emissions,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.  ""With strong support from industry leaders and consumer advocates, DOE will continue to roll out innovative appliance solutions throughout 2024 to lower costs for the American people — continuing the cycle of household savings that are the backbone of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda,"" she continued. BIDEN ADMIN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TARGETING HOME APPLIANCES WITH ECO REGULATIONS IN 2023 Under the regulations, certain less-efficient models of washers and dryers will be barred from being sold, according to DOE.  The clothes washers rule will lead to 30-year energy savings of 0.7 quadrillion British thermal units, a savings of 3% compared to the profile of models currently on the market. And the dryers rule will lead to 30-year energy savings of 2.7 quadrillion British thermal units, a savings of 11% compared to products on the market now. BIDEN ADMIN BACKS OFF GAS STOVE CRACKDOWN AFTER WIDESPREAD PUSHBACK DOE said the regulations largely reflect an agreement issued in September by environmental groups and industry associations. ""Standards at these levels will significantly reduce household energy bills and planet-warming emissions, period,"" Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said after the agreement was reached at the time. ""Swiftly establishing standards at these strong levels will allow the Department of Energy to continue to make progress with the highly successful efficiency standards program — which already saves the average household $500 annually on their energy bills,"" added Natural Resources Defense Council staff attorney Joe Vukovich. BIDEN ADMIN'S WAR ON HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES WILL CAUSE HIGHER PRICES, DIRTIER CLOTHES AND DISHES, EXPERTS WARN The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) — which heavily criticized DOE's original proposal last year on washers and dryers — also signed onto the agreement. AHAM CEO Kelly Mariotti said in September that the compromise regulations would allow ""manufacturers to continue to offer a complete range of energy-efficient products."" ""What we're learning is that the government ought to get out of the business of doing these regulations,"" Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""And not try to just float really extreme ones and then come up with something that's less extreme.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The new standards for washers and dryers, meanwhile, are the latest in a long string of energy efficiency regulations unveiled by DOE over the last 12 months. Climate activists have argued such regulations are necessary to combat global warming, noting that the commercial and residential sector accounts for the largest share of total end-use carbon emissions of any sector in the U.S. However, Republican lawmakers and free market advocates have argued the rules restrict consumer choice and lead to increased upfront costs. ""DOE should be looking for ways to address the problems caused by the existing washing machine regulations rather than making things worse with tougher new regulations,"" Lieberman told Fox News Digital."

The General Services Administration (GSA) announced it would direct Inflation Reduction Act funds to support the climate initiatives at the border, even as the ongoing surge of migrants strains federal resources. While GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan and Andrew Mayock, President Biden's Federal Buy Clean Task Force co-chair, said the action would reduce ""harmful emissions,"" the move was slammed by Republicans and experts. ""As usual, the Biden administration is refusing to address a problem of their own making,"" House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., told Fox News Digital. ""Instead, they’re touting a billion-dollar investment in green technology at the border while Biden’s border crisis continues to wreak havoc on local communities and federal lands. Talk about fiddling while Rome burns."" ""Time and time again, the House Committee on Natural Resources has spotlighted these issues and recently held a field hearing in one of the hardest-hit areas of southern Arizona, yet this administration refuses to address the crisis they’ve created,"" he continued.  DEM STATES, CITIES OVERRUN BY MIGRANTS FUNNELED MILLIONS IN FEDERAL COVID-19 AID TO SUPPORT ILLEGALS The top Republican lawmaker has repeatedly called attention to both the border crisis and environmental degradation indirectly wrought by migrants poring over the U.S.-Mexico border.  ""Spending a billion dollars to build a so-called ‘environmentally friendly’ port of entry feels like a slap in the face to Americans watching our open border policies trash our beautiful public lands day in and day out,"" said Westerman. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION COULD HAVE MAJOR IMPACT ON HOUSE SEATS, ELECTORAL COLLEGE: EXPERTS According to the GSA, the funding will support reduced overall operational emissions of federal activities at the border, development of 23 all-electric buildings, projects ensuring four land ports of entry achieve net-zero emissions, and modernization and paving projects involving embodied carbon avoidance.  For example, $200 million will be used to renovate the Bridge of the Americas port in El Paso, Texas, installing solar panels, electric vehicle chargers and other energy efficiency installations. Another $135 million will be used to make the Douglas Commercial port in Cochise County, Arizona, all-electric, and $100 million will be used to make Arizona's San Luis land port the first net-zero port of entry. In addition to hundreds of millions of dollars spent on southern border ports in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, GSA is also earmarking millions of dollars more for decarbonization projects along the U.S.-Canada border in Washington, Idaho, North Dakota, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Maine. REPUBLICANS PROBE DHS SECRETARY MAYORKAS OVER ROLE IN HOUSING MIGRANTS ON FEDERAL LANDS ""The Biden Administration has made it abundantly clear that it will take no effective action to stop the flow of illegal immigration into the United States, only attempt to process faster the intake of inadmissible aliens,"" NumbersUSA CEO James Massa told Fox News Digital.  ""The long-term effects of the administration's clear aim of adding as many people to the U.S. population by circumventing immigration restrictions put in place by Congress means that our nation's carbon footprint will increase markedly, which is at odds with President Biden's stated goal,"" he added. Massa highlighted that, while the administration seeks to implement ""sustainable technologies"" at the border, the migrant crisis simultaneously strains the ""limited local resources such as water, destroys sensitive environmental sanctuaries for birds and other species, reduces farmland, and creates unsustainable dynamics that weakens the conservation of the nation's natural resources."" ""In addition to endangering those millions of people by encouraging them to travel at the hands of cartels, these journeys across Central America to the U.S. southern border are devastating to croplands and wildlife habitat along the way,"" Massa told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, in January, the federal government reported more than 156,000 migrant encounters at the U.S. southern border, a slight year-over-year uptick, but a decrease compared to the month prior. In December, more than 302,000 migrants were encountered crossing the border, by far the largest single-month figure ever recorded. The December figures brought the fiscal 2024 first-quarter level to 785,000 encounters, the highest number ever recorded. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

The regulations, which were largely crafted and finalized by the Department of Energy (DOE), mainly targeted popular home appliances including stove tops, water heaters, furnaces, dishwashers, refrigerators and ceiling fans. Overall, DOE said its finalized and proposed regulations will curb emissions by 2.4 billion metric tons cumulatively over 30 years, supporting President Biden's ""ambitious efforts to tackle the climate crisis."" ""At the direction of Congress, DOE is continuing to review and finalize energy standards for household appliances, such as residential furnaces, to lower costs for working families by reducing energy use and slashing harmful pollutants in homes across the nation,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in September.  In addition to reducing the U.S. economy's carbon footprint, DOE said its regulations will further save Americans an estimated $570 billion over three decades. BIDEN ADMIN AIMS TO PUSH TOWNS, CITIES TO ADOPT GREEN ENERGY BUILDING CODES: 'VERY SUSPICIOUS' DOE, meanwhile, has pointed to its authority under the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), which established a federal program consisting of test procedures, labeling, and energy targets for consumer products. The 1987 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act then established minimum appliance efficiency standards and requires DOE to periodically update the standards. Then, in the decades that followed, Congress passed additional legislation establishing new appliance standards and requiring DOE to regularly review and update all standards and test procedures. WHITE HOUSE UNVEILS STRICT HYDROGEN REGULATIONS IN VICTORY FOR ENVIRONMENTALISTS ""Ostensibly, these DOE efficiency standards are supposed to benefit consumers. That's the way the law is written,"" Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""But they're clearly being done as part of the climate agenda, especially this agenda to electrify everything."" Experts, including Lieberman, have repeatedly warned over the last 12 months that the Biden administration's energy efficiency actions will ultimately harm consumers and drive prices higher since manufacturers will be forced to adopt newer technologies to achieve the standards. In April, Lieberman led a comment letter alongside more than 15 other consumer organizations, arguing DOE's efficiency standards for stovetops proposed in February ""almost certainly compromise some of the features that gas stove users want, and all for the sake of saving an insignificant amount of energy."" According to the agency's analysis, those standards would effectively ban half of all available stoves. ""The agency’s exaggerated claims of climate change benefits do not alter the fact that proposed rule violates the consumer protections in the statute,"" the comment letter stated. ""For these reasons, we believe the proposed rule should be withdrawn."" JOE MANCHIN VOWS TO FIGHT BIDEN'S WAR ON APPLIANCES: 'NOT SUPPORTING ANY OF THE CRAZINESS' In the months after DOE released its proposed stovetop regulations, it proposed regulations in February for clothes washers and refrigerators that it said would reduce emissions by 233 million metric tons; finalized standards for air conditioners in March; proposed regulations cracking down on dishwashers in May; issued a proposal targeting water heaters in July; and proposed standards for furnaces in September. In addition, in November, Biden invoked wartime powers, awarding $169 million to companies to accelerate electric heat pump manufacturing.  BIDEN INVOKES WARTIME POWERS TO FUND ELECTRIC HEATERS AS HE CRACKS DOWN ON GAS APPLIANCES And the Environmental Protection Agency recently finalized a rule to push an economy-wide transition to more advanced refrigeration and cooling technologies replacing ""climate-damaging"" hydrofluorocarbons. Energy experts warned that the EPA's regulations targeting the chemical will ultimately drive prices higher for new air conditioners and refrigerators, and repairs while harming consumers. ""They are trying to reshape the place that you live to make it look like the home they would like you to live in,"" O.H. Skinner, the Alliance For Consumers' executive director, told Fox News Digital in October. ""They're really trying to impose what are progressive preferences from places in coastal enclaves and make it so that everyone has to live like that. And that affects you every day."" ""What's crucial is to understand this administration isn't just tweaking regulations. They're doing things that effectively ban whole categories of things that exist on the market,"" Skinner continued. ""Almost all of these decisions, as you work through it, are influenced by the overall climate agenda and the green agenda and the desire for us to change our lives."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Environmentalists have long argued in favor of appliance and energy efficiency regulations given their high use of electricity and natural gas. Green energy groups have called for the electrification of homes and businesses, reducing reliance on natural gas and simultaneously replacing current fossil fuel-fired power with alternatives like wind and solar. According to federal data, the commercial and residential sector accounts for 30% of total end-use carbon emissions in the U.S., the largest share of any sector including industry, transportation and agriculture."

The White House announced $3.07 billion in additional federal funding for the California Inaugural High-Speed Rail Service Project as part of a broader announcement Friday unveiling a total of $8.2 billion in new passenger rail corridors nationwide. The project — which has ballooned $80 billion over budget since it was first approved by California voters in 2008 — has been championed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""California is delivering on the first 220-mph, electric high-speed rail project in the nation,"" Newsom said after the funding was announced. ""This show of support from the Biden-Harris Administration is a vote of confidence in today’s vision and comes at a critical turning point, providing the project new momentum."" ""California takes great pride in our ambitious status as the leading edge of high-speed rail in America. With this new $3.07 billion in federal funding, we take an important leap closer to making high-speed rail a reality in California,"" added Pelosi. ""An electrified high-speed rail network will dramatically improve the quality of life in the Central Valley and up and down California."" BIDEN ADMIN FACING CONGRESSIONAL PROBE FOR SENDING BILLIONS TO SOLAR COMPANY ACCUSED OF SCAMMING ELDERLY In its announcement, the White House failed to disclose the project has been under development for more than a decade and has faced significant delays, instead boasting of its climate benefits. An accompanying announcement from the Department of Transportation described it as a project to ""help deliver high-speed rail service in California's Central Valley."" Former Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who left office in early 2011, first introduced the high-speed rail system project, and his Democratic successor, Gov. Jerry Brown, continued the project. The Obama-Biden administration secured more than $2 billion to support the project's development in 2010 using funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the 2009 post-recession stimulus package. BIDEN'S BILLION-DOLLAR PLAN TO BUILD 500,000 EV CHARGERS HAS YET TO YIELD A SINGLE CHARGER The project was originally planned as a $33 billion project consisting of 1,955 miles of railway connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles. Since then, the cost has swelled to $113 billion and the project's scope has been dramatically scaled down to a 171-mile railway connecting Bakersfield, Fresno and Merced that isn't expected to be operational until 2030. Overall, if the project is completed in 2030, it will have taken a decade longer than expected, while costing $80 billion more and being 91% smaller than originally planned. Because of its repeated shortfalls, the project has been dubbed by critics as the ""train to nowhere."" ""This commuter train isn’t even ‘high speed,’ is at least 13 years behind schedule, and will now cost four times the original price tag promised to voters,"" Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., who has opposed the project for years, told Fox News Digital. ""Far too much taxpayer dollars have been wasted on this boondoggle. It’s in everyone’s best interest to cut the losses and rescind every cent dedicated to this foolish project."" ""Any fool can see this project isn’t going to be completed,"" LaMalfa continued. ""The state is $68 billion in debt, hasn’t laid a single inch of track and is over $120 billion short. Biden and Newsom sure know how to waste your money."" HOUSE PANEL TO PROBE BIDEN ADMIN'S NEGOTIATIONS WITH ECO GROUPS TRYING TO TEAR DOWN KEY POWER SOURCE And fellow California Republican Rep. Jay Obernolte also blasted the project, noting that even when it is operational, its ridership will fall short of covering the expected operating costs. ""I believe it is inappropriate for the federal government to subsidize the California High-Speed Rail Authority,"" Obernolte told Fox News Digital. ""This rail system is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget, and even if it is ever completed, its projected ridership won’t come close to covering its operating costs — meaning that taxpayers will be asked to continue subsidizing it forever. This is not a wise or appropriate use of taxpayer money."" Shortly after taking office in 2019, Newsom acknowledged in his first State of the State address that he would scale the project down from its original ambitious plan, saying it would cost too much and take too long to stay the course. He noted during his remarks that ""there’s been too little oversight and not enough transparency."" Months later, the Trump administration penned a scathing letter to California, informing the state that it was rescinding the multi-billion-dollar grant awarded for the project under the Obama administration. Former Federal Railroad Administration Administrator Ronald Batory wrote that California ""has no foreseeable plans, nor the capability, to pursue that statewide [High-Speed Rail] System as originally proposed."" In June 2021, the Biden administration said it would reverse that decision and restore the funding.

Patterson characterized criticism aimed at the project as ""hot air."""
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-allies-turn-against-key-part-his-climate-agenda,Biden allies turn against key part of his climate agenda,01/02/2024,Lawmakers and green groups often allied with the Biden administration are taking aim at a recent White House proposal dictating future green energy tax credits.,"Democratic lawmakers and clean energy groups who often align themselves with President Biden on environmental policy are turning against his administration's latest green energy tax credit guidance. In highly-anticipated guidance released late last month, the White House, Treasury Department and Department of Energy proposed rules governing tax credits for hydrogen power production, which advocates believe will be a critical tool for decarbonization. The guidance, though, tethers the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) highest production credit of $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced to strict eco standards. ""The Biden Administration’s proposal attempts to launch a green hydrogen industry while guarding against any possibility of emissions increases during initial commercial deployment,"" said Jason Grumet, the CEO of the American Clean Power Association, a clean power industry group often allied with the Biden administration. ""Unfortunately, the Administration proposal contains a fatal – but fixable – flaw that must be addressed to realize the economic, environmental, and climate benefits of commercially scaling a domestic green hydrogen industry,"" Grumet added. ""While ACP embraces the basic structure of the Administration’s three-pillar approach, the rushed imposition of the most burdensome restrictions fails to acknowledge the market realities of new technology deployment."" GOP REPORT HIGHLIGHTS 2023 ENERGY, OVERSIGHT WINS OVER 'UNREALISTIC CLIMATE AGENDA' The hydrogen production tax credits are some of the most generous clean energy incentives earmarked under the IRA, Democrats' massive climate and tax bill President Biden signed in August 2022, and are worth up to $100 billion. The legislation marked the nation's most ambitious effort yet to spur the growth of hydrogen generation, which remains a nascent technology requiring billions of dollars in investment to achieve large-scale production. But a common pathway for hydrogen production is electrolysis, a process by which hydrogen is split from water using an electric current. While the only emissions from electrolysis are hydrogen and oxygen, environmentalists have argued that hydrogen reliance could be rendered pointless as a zero-emissions power source if the electricity generated for that process is generated from fossil fuel-fired sources. BIDEN ADMIN AIMS TO PUSH TOWNS, CITIES TO ADOPT GREEN ENERGY BUILDING CODES: 'VERY SUSPICIOUS' ""The Clean Hydrogen Production Credit aims to make production of clean hydrogen with minimal climate pollution more economically competitive and accelerate development of the U.S. clean hydrogen industry,"" the Treasury Department said on Dec. 22. Under the guidance, hydrogen producers are only eligible for the highest tax credit if electricity is generated from a green energy source, such as wind and solar, that came online within three years of a new facility being placed into service. That provision means a facility fueled by green energy that has been operational for more than three years is ineligible for the credit. In addition, the guidance requires that, beginning in 2028, hydrogen developers' electricity generation is sourced from a clean source on an hourly basis, the most stringent timescale. In other words, the electricity generated by electrolysis must be produced within an hour of hydrogen production from that electricity. Sens. Tom Carper, D-Del., the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee; Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, the chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee; and Bob Casey, D-Pa., all quickly expressed concern following the release of the guidance last month. BIDEN ADMIN HIT WITH LEGAL CHALLENGE OVER GAS APPLIANCE CRACKDOWN ""The development of the U.S. clean hydrogen industry is critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, meeting our nation’s climate goals, and creating good-paying jobs across America,"" Carper said in a statement. ""While I applaud the Biden Administration’s work to advance clean hydrogen, I fear that this proposed rule may well miss the mark."" ""When developing the Inflation Reduction Act, we intended for the clean hydrogen incentives to be flexible and technology-neutral,"" he continued. ""Treasury’s draft guidance does not fully reflect this intent, potentially jeopardizing the clean hydrogen industry’s ability to get off the ground successfully. Fortunately, the Biden Administration has made it clear that there will be opportunities in the days ahead to revise the rule. Without meaningful changes, I will find it difficult to support the final rule."" Brown, meanwhile, argued the guidance would ""undermine"" the nation's ability to produce affordable clean hydrogen. ""I have serious concerns about the administration’s proposed guidance,"" the Ohio Democrat said. ""These new proposed rules will slow down and ultimately undermine our country’s ability to produce the clean hydrogen needed to build the energy economy of the future."" ""We wrote the Inflation Reduction Act to lower energy costs for Ohioans and unleash innovation in clean energy production in Appalachia and across the Midwest – and these rules undermine that clear goal,"" Brown added. ""The administration must listen to Ohioans and fix the serious flaws in these rules before they are finalized."" MAINE FORCED TO DELAY VOTE ON EV MANDATE AMID WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES And Casey similarly expressed concern that the administration's proposal would harm workers and the economy. ""I have serious questions that this proposed rule will hinder our ability to produce clean hydrogen to power the U.S.’s energy future,"" Casey said in a statement. ""Further, it appears that this rule may cut out of the equation Pennsylvania workers and businesses that are ready and willing to lead the way on hydrogen power."" ""Pennsylvania jobs are at stake, and I am going to keep pushing the Administration to listen to Pennsylvanians, especially those in energy communities, and ensure our Commonwealth is poised to take full advantage of this tax credit in the way that Congress intended,"" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Prior to the announcement last month, Carper, Brown, Casey and nine other Senate Democrats had called on Biden to issue looser guidance that would progressively get stricter over the next decade. Overall, hydrogen has been widely pegged as a key technology for reducing future greenhouse gas emissions, especially in hard-to-decarbonize sectors like shipping, heavy trucking and cement and steel manufacturing. The transportation and industrial sectors account for nearly 60% of U.S. end-use emissions."
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-appointed-judge-delivers-blow-climate-lawsuit-targeting-gas-stoves,Biden-appointed judge delivers blow to climate lawsuit targeting gas stoves,02-22-2024,A federal judge appointed to the bench by President Biden largely dismissed a class-action lawsuit targeting the sale of gas-powered stovetops over their emissions.,"A federal judge has largely tossed a class-action lawsuit filed by a California resident who alleged that a major appliance manufacturer committed fraud by characterizing his gas-powered stovetop as safe despite its emissions. Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California — who was nominated by President Biden and received Senate confirmation last year — last week dismissed with prejudice the majority of claims made by Charles Drake, the plaintiff in the case. The only count not completely dismissed is Drake's allegation that the defendant, GE Appliances' parent company, Haier Appliances, violated an implied warranty of merchantability. ""Drake does not allege the necessary elements of fraud by omission under California law,"" Martínez-Olguín wrote in her decision. ""Most glaringly, Drake fails to plead the second and fourth elements of fraud by omission: that Haier held a duty to disclose the fact of the emissions to him, or that Drake justifiably relied on Haier's concealment of the dangerous emissions from his gas stove."" ""Drake alleges no connection between Haier and the studies he cites, appearing to conclude merely that Haier 'should have known.' This does not meet the specificity required for claims sounding in fraud,"" she added. ""Therefore, the claims sounding in fraud must also be dismissed on this basis."" BIDEN ADMIN BACKS OFF GAS STOVE CRACKDOWN AFTER WIDESPREAD PUSHBACK The case dates back to early March 2023 when the California-based law firm Dovel & Luner filed the class-action suit on behalf of Drake. The complaint stated that gas stoves produce ""health-harming pollutants,"" such as nitrogen oxide, and points to a Consumer Reports article titled ""Is Your Gas Range a Health Risk?"" as evidence of said harms. Drake's complaint further pointed to a 2022 study funded by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a climate think tank which has advocated for a broad economy-wide green energy transition. That same study was cited by U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission member Richard Trumka Jr. when he floated a ban on gas stoves last year, sparking outrage among consumer advocates and lawmakers. BIDEN ADMIN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TARGETING HOME APPLIANCES WITH ECO REGULATIONS IN 2023 And the complaint argued that Haier Appliances should be aware of such research and, therefore, the potential harms posed by gas stoves. Such harms would constitute a product ""defect"" and, since Haier still sells the products, would mean the company is committing consumer fraud, according to Drake.  ""Like other makers of gas stoves, Defendant monitors and keeps track of research on the health effects of its products,"" the complaint stated. ""This is diligence that large companies like Defendant routinely do when selling a consumer product. Defendant is aware of the fact that its Products emit harmful pollutants. It is further aware that use of gas stoves increases the rates of respiratory illness in adults and children."" But Martínez-Olguín noted in her ruling that plaintiffs are typically required to allege ""how the defendant obtained knowledge of the specific defect prior the plaintiff’s purchase of the defective product in order to sufficiently allege the manufacturer’s awareness of a defect."" By broadly stating Haier ""keeps track of research,"" Drake failed to overcome that hurdle, she ruled. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The judge ultimately gave Drake until March 14 to file an amended complaint, meaning the case is technically ongoing. GE Appliances declined to comment, citing its policy ""not to comment on pending litigation."" Dovel & Luner didn't respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, the ruling is the latest setback for environmentalists who have sought nationwide crackdowns on gas stoves over their climate impact. In January, a federal appeals court delivered a fatal blow to a natural gas ban proposed by the city of Berkeley, California, and, weeks later, the Biden administration watered down regulations targeting gas stoves in a win for the appliance industry."

""What's the carbon footprint of these events every single year that you come here? Do you think it's worth it — peasants paying for your crimes?"" Avi Yemini, an Australian reporter with independent outlet Rebel News, asked Kerry who was walking on a street in Davos, Switzerland. ""That's a stupid question,"" Kerry responded. ""Nobody ever suggested that. Don't make up stupid questions,"" he said when asked a follow-up question about why his carbon footprint didn't matter. Kerry — who is in Davos to attend the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) summit, which largely focuses on environmental issues like climate change and achieving net-zero ambitions — added that he has done a ""huge amount"" to combat climate change. Security personnel escorting Kerry between WEF events ultimately blocked Yemini from asking further questions. TOP HOUSE COMMITTEE PROBES JOHN KERRY'S COORDINATION WITH ECO GROUPS PUSHING COAL POWER SHUTDOWN Yemini later said in a social media post that Kerry ""found it difficult to justify his carbon footprint in attending the World Economic Forum each year in Davos."" The confrontation comes days after reports surfaced that Kerry would step down from his role as special presidential envoy for climate (SPEC) at the State Department. On Tuesday, he confirmed the reports but said he would merely shift his efforts, not retire. CHINESE TECH COMPANIES ARE EXPLOITING US GREEN ENERGY GOALS, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS WARN Shortly after taking office in 2021, President Biden appointed Kerry to the role, a position that hadn't previously existed and didn't require Senate approval, and gave him a spot in the president's Cabinet and National Security Council. The SPEC office is housed at the State Department and has an estimated $13.9 million annual budget with approval for 45 personnel. Since assuming the role, Kerry has traveled worldwide, attending high-profile climate summits and diplomatic engagements in an effort to push a global transition from fossil fuels to green energy alternatives. In addition to attending multiple United Nations global warming summits, he has attended multiple WEF conferences. GOP SENATOR ROASTS JOHN KERRY FOR JETTING OFF TO ANOTHER CLIMATE CONFERENCE But Kerry has received criticism for his carbon footprint, including his past use of a private jet owned by his family. According to flight tracking data obtained by Fox News Digital in July 2022, a Gulfstream GIV-SP jet owned by Kerry's family made a total of 48 trips that lasted more than 60 hours and emitted an estimated 715,886 pounds, or 325 metric tons, of carbon over the course of the Biden administration's first 18 months. However, one month after the Fox News Digital report that highlighted the jet's extensive carbon footprint and after lawmakers blasted Kerry for apparent hypocrisy, the Gulfstream jet was sold to an energy-focused hedge fund in New York City. Whitney Smith, a State Department spokesperson, confirmed the sale in a statement last year and said Kerry travels commercially in his current role. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""John Kerry is an unelected bureaucrat who’s making decisions that have major impacts on the lives of Americans, the overwhelming majority of whom are going to be more worried about the cost of gas to drive their cars to work, not the cost of fuel to fly a jet to King Charles’ coronation,"" Rep.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced the new regulations Friday morning, and officials said they represent the strongest-ever greenhouse gas emissions standards of their kind. The rules will kick in beginning in 2026 for model year 2027 vehicles and progressively become more stringent through model year 2032, forcing a larger number of trucks and buses to be zero-emissions in that time frame. ""EPA’s standards complement President Biden’s unprecedented investment in our workers and communities to reduce harmful emissions, while strengthening our manufacturing capacity for the transportation technologies of the future,"" said White House Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. ""By tackling pollution from heavy-duty vehicles, we can unlock extraordinary public health, climate, and economic gains."" ""In finalizing these emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles like trucks and buses, EPA is significantly cutting pollution from the hardest-working vehicles on the road,"" said EPA Administrator Michael Regan. ""Building on our recently finalized rule for light- and medium-duty vehicles, EPA’s strong and durable vehicle standards respond to the urgency of the climate crisis by making deep cuts in emissions from the transportation sector."" TRUMP CAMPAIGN UNLEASHES ON BIDEN FOR BACKING CALIFORNIA'S GAS CAR BAN Overall, EPA said the aggressive standards will avoid a billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions and provide $13 billion in annualized net societal benefits related to public health, the climate and business savings. The agency claims that the regulations will set the heavy-duty vehicle industry on a ""trajectory for sustained growth."" The new regulations apply to short-haul and long-haul tractor-trailer trucks, in addition to vocational trucks like delivery vehicles, garbage trucks, school and public transit buses, concrete trucks and fire trucks. EPA previously projected that the standards could lead to 50% of vocational trucks, 35% of short-haul tractor-trailers and 25% of long-haul tractor-trailers produced in 2032 being electric. Less than 1% of new truck sales in the U.S. are zero-emissions, according to the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association, which represents the world’s leading manufacturers of heavy-duty vehicles. VULNERABLE HOUSE DEM BUCKS PARTY ORTHODOXY, BLASTING HIS STATE'S PROPOSED EV MANDATE ""With the climate crisis underway and many of our communities facing unprecedented fires, droughts and floods, it’s crucial that truck manufacturers get into the fast lane with zero-emission trucks to deliver the climate, health, and economic benefits we deserve,"" said Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign. Garcia and other environmental activists who lauded the regulations have for years called on the federal government to crack down on the trucking industry, pointing to its heavy carbon footprint. The transportation sector accounts for 29% of the nation's total greenhouse gas emissions, and medium- and heavy-duty trucks account for 23% of those emissions, federal data shows. However, the announcement immediately received pushback from the trucking industry and energy producers, who argued that it would lead to higher costs for trucking companies.  ""Small business truckers, who happen to care about clean air for themselves and their kids as much as anyone, make up 96% of trucking,"" said Todd Spencer, president of Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, an organization that represents more than 150,000 members across all 50 states and Canada. ""Yet, this administration seems dead set on regulating every local mom-and-pop business out of existence with its flurry of unworkable environmental mandates."" MAINE REJECTS SWEEPING ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE IN BLOW TO GOVERNOR'S CLIMATE AGENDA In comments filed with the EPA last year, the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association warned that the administration had overestimated the nearer-term feasible market penetration and adoption rates of electric trucks, and the demand for them.  In a joint statement, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers President and CEO Chet Thompson and American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers called on Congress to immediately overturn the regulations. They also said they were prepared to take the administration to court over the rule. ""This is yet another example of the Biden administration’s whole-of-government effort to eliminate choices for American consumers, businesses and industries,"" Thompson and Sommers said. ""There is significant uncertainty regarding the technological and infrastructure capability to comply with this rule, which may threaten the speed and cost of goods moving throughout the country."" 130+ HOUSE, SENATE REPUBLICANS JOIN FORCES IN OPPOSITION OF BIDEN'S UPCOMING EV MANDATE The regulations are also sure to attract considerable criticism from Republican lawmakers, who have for months warned the Biden administration against targeting the heavy-duty vehicle industry. Last week, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said he would soon introduce a resolution to rescind the standards once they are finalized. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""In the midst of sustained, crippling inflation, President Biden is choosing to add more regulatory dead weight onto our economy and our critical supply chains,"" Sullivan said. ""Hard-working families across the country will pay the price if this rule is allowed to stand. The cost of this rule will be felt in the rising price of gas, bread, eggs and other life essentials."" The final standards are somewhat less stringent than the first proposed standards in April 2023. They come one week after the EPA finalized its multi-pollutant emission standards for light- and medium-duty vehicles, the strongest of their kind to date."
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-moratorium-natural-gas-exports-could-crush-small-businesses-top-republican-warns,"Biden's moratorium on natural gas exports could crush small businesses, top Republican warns",02-28-2024,FIRST ON FOX: A top House Republican is putting pressure on the Biden administration over its decision to freeze natural gas exports due to climate concerns.,"FIRST ON FOX: A top House Republican is warning that President Biden's recent moratorium on liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports over climate concerns could hit U.S. small businesses the hardest. House Small Business Committee Chairman Roger Williams, R-Texas, penned a letter Wednesday morning to President Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, warning of the ""detrimental impacts"" the policy will have on small businesses, the U.S. economy broadly and America's strategic interests worldwide. In the letter, Williams demanded answers to a series of questions about the administration's actions. ""Currently over 90 percent of oil and natural gas extractors are small businesses, and the Committee seeks a deeper explanation of this decision and its impacts on those businesses and U.S. strategic priorities,"" Williams wrote to Biden and Granholm, adding that the administration appears intent on making it hard for small fossil fuel operators to ""to compete and earn a living."" ""This export decision will force the U.S. to turn its back on our European allies and push them back into the hands of the Russian Federation,"" the Small Business Committee chair continued. ""This not only works against the U.S.’ strategic interests, but creates challenges for businesses, large and small, that had planned to export their products to Europe and Asia over the coming years."" TIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN'S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM Williams added that small U.S. natural gas producers have taken advantage of the opportunity to replace Russian gas in global markets. In the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago, U.S. LNG largely filled the void left by Russian natural gas as U.S. allies sought to wean off Russian exports and punish the nation's economy, a plan Biden endorsed at the time. In December 2023, more than 87% of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe, U.K., or Asian markets. DOZENS OF FORMER TOP FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL ON CONGRESS TO STRIKE DOWN BIDEN'S NATURAL GAS CRACKDOWN ""It is important for agencies to examine small businesses' interests — which make up 99.9 percent of all businesses in the U.S. — when making such an impactful decision. America’s small businesses deserve to have their voices heard and considered,"" Williams wrote. In January, Biden ordered the Department of Energy (DOE) to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects' carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The action is a major victory for activists who have loudly called for such a move, which they said would help combat global warming. STATE AGS WARN BIDEN'S NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW, DEMAND REVERSAL The president confirmed the pause on LNG permitting was a part of his sweeping climate agenda, adding the action ""sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time."" He also took aim at ""MAGA Republicans"" for willfully denying the ""urgency of the climate crisis."" However, the move was blasted by industry groups, former federal officials and bipartisan lawmakers, who noted energy exports, in addition to aiding allies in Europe and Asia, bolster domestic energy production and boost the U.S. economy. HOUSE DELIVERS BLOW TO BIDEN'S CLIMATE AGENDA, VOTES AGAINST NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM Fossil fuel industry groups recently cited research indicating that LNG exports could add as much as $73 billion to the U.S. economy by 2040, create 453,000 American jobs and increase U.S. purchasing power by $30 billion. Critics of Biden's action also argued it would not help the environment since global consumers will, as a result, likely revert to greater reliance on coal or Russian gas, both of which are dirtier than U.S. LNG. ""Holding exports of American LNG, which meet U.S. environmental standards, in favor of European and Asian coal or Russian LNG, is likely to harm the environment more than simply approving these exports,"" Williams wrote. While it remains unclear which proposed projects the action will affect, a senior administration official said at least two have a larger capacity and two have a smaller capacity. Another official added that the pause implemented Friday will only impact projects that have gone through FERC's lengthy approval process and are ripe for DOE approval. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to federal data, there are 11 projects that have been green-lit by FERC but are not yet under construction. An additional four projects are pending before FERC and two are in the pre-filing stage. Those six projects would not be impacted by the pause since they are not before the DOE yet but would be impacted if approved by FERC. The White House and DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

In a petition for writ of certiorari filed Wednesday, the oil companies — including Sunoco, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Marathon Petroleum, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66, among others — asked the high court to intervene in a climate case filed against them by the City and County of Honolulu. They said a Supreme Court judgment in the case could have far-reaching impacts on the other similar cases filed by other jurisdictions. ""Rarely does a case of such extraordinary importance to one of the nation’s most vital industries come before this Court,"" the companies wrote in the filing. ""Energy companies that produce, sell, and market fossil fuels are facing numerous lawsuits in state courts across the Nation seeking billions of dollars in damages for injuries allegedly caused by global climate change."" ""This case presents the Court with its only foreseeable opportunity in the near future to decide a dispositive question that is arising in every climate-change case: whether federal law precludes state-law claims seeking redress for injuries allegedly caused by the effects of interstate and international greenhouse-gas emissions on the global climate,"" the filing continued. BILLIONAIRE-FUELED ROCKEFELLER FUND COORDINATED CLIMATE LAWSUITS WITH DEM STATE AG: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS The companies requested the Supreme Court specifically ""review and clarify"" whether state law is able to impose the costs of global climate change ""on a subset of the world’s energy producers"" chosen by plaintiffs in the case. ""Without this Court’s intervention, years might pass before another opportunity to address this pressing question comes along,"" it added. TED CRUZ PROBES LEFT-WING GROUP OVER EFFORT TRAINING FEDERAL JUDGES FOR CLIMATE CASES The case dates back nearly four years when, in March 2020, Honolulu officials announced they had sued the companies for damages related to climate change and for deceiving the public about their fossil fuel products' potential impact on global warming.  Honolulu is one of more than a dozen major jurisdictions to file such a lawsuit against oil companies in recent years. Overall, states and cities including California, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Minnesota, Chicago, New York City, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Baltimore, which collectively represent more than 25% of Americans, are pursuing similar litigation. The fossil fuel industry has unsuccessfully attempted to move some of the cases from state courts, where they have been filed, to federal courts. In January, the Supreme Court declined to weigh in on that question, forcing the cases back to state courthouses. But the filing Wednesday represents the first time the Supreme Court has been asked to review issues around the merits. It particularly calls on the court to recognize that the federal Clean Air Act effectively preempts state law and that state laws are unable to provide ""relief for global climate change."" CONSUMER GROUP REVEALS LEFT-WING GROUPS INCREASINGLY USING COURTS TO PUSH GREEN NEW DEAL ""State court litigation is not a constitutionally permissible means to establish global climate and energy policy,"" Theodore Boutrous, who serves as counsel for Chevron Corporation, said in a written statement to Fox News Digital. ""As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in dismissing a similar New York City lawsuit, ‘such a sprawling case is simply beyond the limits of state law.’"" In a separate statement, Phil Goldberg, special counsel for the National Association of Manufacturers' Accountability Project, called for the Supreme Court to grant the petition. ""Regulating the worldwide production and use of energy — as the plaintiffs’ case attempts to do — is simply beyond the limits of any individual state’s law,"" Goldberg said. ""Trying to apply Hawaii state law to climate change here is directly at odds with these rulings, and the Supreme Court should take this case to make sure that states properly follow its jurisprudence."" TOP REPUBLICANS LAUNCH PROBE INTO LEONARDO DICAPRIO-FUNDED BLUE STATE LAWSUITS AGAINST BIG OIL The Honolulu case, along with a large share of the other similar cases filed by state and local governments, is being spearheaded by the California law firm Sher Edling. Sher Edling, which was founded in 2016 with the stated goal of taking on such litigation, states on its website that its climate practice seeks to hold oil companies accountable for their alleged ""deception"" about climate change.

In its nearly 200-page complaint filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County late Tuesday, Chicago listed BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Phillips 66, Shell and the American Petroleum Institute (API) as defendants. The filing blames the companies for causing global warming broadly and a series of specific deadly weather events in the city stretching back decades. ""There is no justice without accountability,"" Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement. ""From the unprecedented poor air quality that we experienced last summer to the basement floodings that our residents on the West Side experienced, the consequences of this crisis are severe, as are the costs of surviving them. That is why we are seeking to hold these defendants accountable."" ""Evidence shows that these defendants intentionally misled Chicago residents about the climate change-related dangers associated with their oil and gas products. If unabated, climate change could result in catastrophic impacts on our city,"" added Chicago counsel Mary Richardson-Lowry. ""We bring this lawsuit to ensure that the defendants who have profited from the deception campaign bear responsibility for their conduct."" BILLIONAIRE-FUELED ROCKEFELLER FUND COORDINATED CLIMATE LAWSUITS WITH DEM STATE AG: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS Chicago's lawsuit seeks relief in the form of hundreds of millions of dollars in compensatory and loss-of-use damages, and penalties and fines for statutory violations. It also seeks disgorgement of profits and enjoining the companies from ""engaging in the deceptive and unfair acts and practices alleged in the lawsuit."" LEFT-WING CLIMATE GROUP IS QUIETLY PREPARING JUDGES FOR GLOBAL WARMING CASES While the city did not immediately publish a copy of the complaint, a copy obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times shows that it alleges 11 counts of fraud, nuisance, conspiracy and negligence. Additionally, the complaint points to a 1995 heat wave which claimed the lives of more than 700 residents as evidence of the dangers posed by fossil fuels. It also blames the oil companies for extreme heat, increased rain and flooding. CONSUMER GROUP REVEALS LEFT-WING GROUPS INCREASINGLY USING COURTS TO PUSH GREEN NEW DEAL ""The record of the past two decades demonstrates that the industry has achieved its goal of providing affordable, reliable American energy to U.S. consumers while substantially reducing emissions and our environmental footprint,"" API Senior Vice President and General Counsel Ryan Meyers told Fox News Digital in a statement.  ""This ongoing, coordinated campaign to wage meritless, politicized lawsuits against a foundational American industry and its workers is nothing more than a distraction from important national conversations and an enormous waste of taxpayer resources,"" Meyers continued. ""Climate policy is for Congress to debate and decide, not a patchwork of city halls and courts."" Theodore Boutrous, who serves as counsel for Chevron Corporation and is a partner at the firm Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, added that climate change should be addressed through legislation, not piecemeal litigation filed across the country. ""Addressing climate change requires a coordinated international policy response, not meritless local litigation over lawful and essential energy production,"" Boutrous said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in dismissing a similar New York City lawsuit, ‘such a sprawling case is simply beyond the limits of state law.’"" The complaint, meanwhile, closely mirrors similar lawsuits filed by states, cities and counties nationwide. Chicago is being represented by the California law firm Sher Edling, which has spearheaded such climate-related public nuisance lawsuits arguing that oil companies are financially responsible for global warming. TOP REPUBLICANS LAUNCH PROBE INTO LEONARDO DICAPRIO-FUNDED BLUE STATE LAWSUITS AGAINST BIG OIL The firm has filed cases on behalf of Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Minnesota, New York City, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Baltimore, Honolulu and local governments across the country. In January, a judge consolidated seven of Sher Edling's local climate cases in California with the state government's case, meaning the firm effectively has a role in the deception case filed by the State of California as well. Sher Edling, which was founded in 2016 with the stated goal of taking on such litigation, states on its website that its climate practice seeks to hold oil companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Shell accountable for their alleged ""deception"" about climate change. The firm has raised millions of dollars from liberal dark money nonprofits to fund its pursuits.

According to the left-wing climate group Sunrise Movement, 21 of its members were arrested and roughly 80 others were involved in the protest in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday. The activists warned that, if Biden failed to take definitive action combating climate change, millions of young voters would stay home in November. ""Climate change is at our doorstep. Our homes are flooding, we’re breathing in toxic air, Black people like me are dying while the President expands oil and gas production to record levels,"" Sunrise campaign director Kidus Girma said in a statement after the protest. ""Then President Biden goes around and claims he’s a climate president and wants our votes? That’s bulls---."" While Girma failed to specify which actions Biden has taken to boost greater reliance on fossil fuels, the Sunrise Movement has repeatedly called for him to formally declare global warming a national emergency, an action he has resisted throughout his presidency. A climate emergency declaration would enable Biden to bypass Congress and take a number of executive actions not normally granted to the White House. MODERATE DEMS SILENT AS BIDEN SKIRTS SENATE CONFIRMATION FOR JOHN KERRY'S REPLACEMENT In addition, the Sunrise Movement broadly opposes all oil, gas and coal development, calling instead for an aggressive nationwide transition to green energy sources like wind and solar. Currently, fossil fuels generate the majority of domestic electricity and support both the transportation and manufacturing sectors in America, according to federal data. ""There are dozens of things he could sign into law tomorrow if he wanted to protect low-income communities of color like mine that live next to fossil fuel sites that are killing us through cancer and asthma,"" Sunrise Movement volunteer Ariela Lara said. ""He could make sure that every time a climate disaster hits, no one gets evicted and everyone has access to free health care,"" she continued. ""He could end the fossil fuel era by refusing to approve a single oil or gas well in this country. Biden can’t build renewables on Monday, build fossil fuels on Tuesday, and then claim to be climate president. That’s not how science works, and young voters know it."" AOC DECLARES VICTORY IN FIGHT FOR GREEN NEW DEAL 5 YEARS LATER: 'SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION' But while Biden has yet to declare a climate emergency, he has repeatedly taken aim at the fossil fuel industry while seeking to boost green energy. Shortly after taking office, the president signed executive orders to pause all oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, and canceled permits for the Keystone XL oil pipeline project. Although a federal court eventually intervened to force the Biden administration to continue leasing, it has dragged its feet on holding new lease sales and created regulatory roadblocks for producers. And Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which earmarks tens of billions of dollars for green energy programs. His administration has also unleashed an onslaught of environmental regulations to curb fossil fuel power plant electricity generation, push electric vehicles and incentivize the electrification of the residential sector.

According to court filings reviewed by Fox News, Sher Edling's founding partners, Vic Sher and Matt Edling, were admitted to the case of Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. ExxonMobil Corp. following a request from Seth Schofield, senior counsel for the Massachusetts Attorney General's Energy and Environment Bureau. Both Sher and Edling affirmed in separate affidavits that they would appear on behalf of the state. Text from both affidavits, filed in Suffolk County Superior Court, read: ""I am familiar with the facts and law relevant to the claims and defenses in this action, and my appearance and participation will aid the attorney general in her prosecution of this case."" It remains unclear what Sher Edling's exact role in the case will be and how its involvement will impact the many other Big Oil cases it is pursuing on behalf of more than a dozen states and cities.

CONSUMER GROUP REVEALS LEFT-WING GROUPS INCREASINGLY USING COURTS TO PUSH GREEN NEW DEAL In October 2019, then-Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat who is now the state's governor, filed the initial complaint against ExxonMobil, accusing the company of engaging in deceptive practices by failing to disclose the climate change risks posed by fossil fuels. The lawsuit came after a yearslong investigation into the company's day-to-day operations. Healey said at the time that ExxonMobil ""has known for decades about the catastrophic climate impacts of burning fossil fuels — its chief product."" BIG OIL COMPANIES ASK SUPREME COURT TO INTERVENE IN HIGH-STAKES CLIMATE CASE But ExxonMobil fired back, arguing in court that Massachusetts' allegations implicate the company's ""right to petition as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution."" It added that the state objects to the company's protected activities merely because they ""influenced climate policy in a manner that is contrary to the policy objectives of the attorney general."" Sher Edling's involvement, meanwhile, adds to the growing list of cases the firm has taken up. It was founded in 2016 to pursue climate-related litigation against oil companies, arguing they have known about their impact on global warming for decades.  The firm is pursuing such litigation on behalf of Delaware, Minnesota, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Baltimore, Honolulu and several local governments across the country. Overall, more than 25% of Americans live in jurisdictions suing Big Oil for climate deception. BILLIONAIRE-FUELED ROCKEFELLER FUND COORDINATED CLIMATE LAWSUITS WITH DEM STATE AG: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS Though the entirety of Sher Edling's funding structure is unknown, the firm has for years raised millions of dollars from nonprofit organizations. These nonprofits shield the identities of their individual donors, effectively ensuring that anonymous individuals and groups play a pivotal role in the firm's climate litigation efforts.  According to tax filings, between 2017 and 2020, the Collective Action Fund for Accountability, Resilience, and Adaptation (CAF), a secretive group fiscally sponsored by Washington, D.C.-based New Venture Fund, wired more than $5.2 million to Sher Edling. In 2021, CAF funneled $3 million to the firm, and in 2022, it wired grants worth a total of $2.5 million to the firm. In 2021, CAF switched its fiscal sponsorship from a smaller, dark new money group to New Venture Fund, which is managed by Arabella Advisors, a firm that oversees a liberal billion-dollar dark money network.

In a sprawling verdict delivered on Thursday afternoon after a multiweek trial, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia jury determined that Steyn and fellow commentator Rand Simberg defamed scientist Michael Mann, the creator of the famed ""hockey stick"" graph, more than a decade ago. The jury additionally ordered Simberg to pay Mann $1,000 in punitive damages, and both he and Steyn were ordered to pay just $1 each to Mann in compensatory damages. ""I hope this verdict sends a message that falsely attacking climate scientists is not protected speech,"" Mann said in a statement issued after the verdict was delivered late Thursday. ""We consider this a win for the truthful reporting of climate science matters,"" Mann's lawyer John Williams added in an email to Fox News Digital. AOC DECLARES VICTORY IN FIGHT FOR GREEN NEW DEAL 5 YEARS LATER: 'SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION' The case dates back to 2012 when Mann first filed his lawsuit against Simberg and Steyn. He argued the pair of commentators defamed him in separate posts in which they compared him to Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who had recently been convicted of child molestation. Years earlier, in 1998, Mann, who remains a University of Pennsylvania climate professor, published a study in the journal Nature showing his ""hockey stick"" grasp, which showed the Earth warming at a rapid pace. The graph was then used worldwide, including in subsequent United Nations climate reports, to prove that global warming was an increasing threat to humanity. However, critics, like Steyn and Simberg, have repeatedly cast doubt on Mann's graph and underlying data.  JOHN KERRY'S CLIMATE OFFICE FACES GOP OVERSIGHT PROBE OVER COORDINATION WITH ECO GROUP 'KITCHEN CABINET' Then, in July 2012, Simberg, then a fellow at the free market think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute, published a blog post making the original comparison between Mann and Sandusky.  ""Mann could be said to be the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except for instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data,"" Simberg wrote in the post. Steyn published a blog post of his own in National Review three days later, referencing Simberg's article. Though, Steyn appeared to back off Simberg's original comparison in his article. ""I’m not sure I’d have extended that metaphor all the way into the locker room showers with quite the zeal Mr. Simberg does, but he has a point,"" Steyn wrote at the time. He further identified Mann as ""the man behind the fraudulent climate-change 'hockey-stick' graph, the very ringmaster of the tree-ring circus,"" in reference to climate science which measures historical temperatures using tree ring analyses. STATE AGS WARN BIDEN'S NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW, DEMAND REVERSAL The jury on Thursday ultimately found that the two commentators' posts were defamatory, asserted or implied a provably false fact, had reckless disregard for whether their statements were false and injured Mann as a result. ""I have no difficulty standing on the truth,"" Steyn said during his opening remarks at the trial last month. ""The truth of what I wrote, the truth about what happened at a famous American institution, the truth about this man."" ""In my world, I can write something, Mr. Simberg can write something, and Mr. Mann can write something — and you’re free to read all or none, and decide what weight to attach to all or none. But, in Mr Mann’s world, there’s his take — and everyone else has to be hockey-sticked into submission and silence,"" he continued. ""He’s a classic example of the guy who can dish it out but can’t take it."" BIDEN ADMIN SUED FOR HIDING JOHN KERRY'S STAFF, COORDINATION WITH ECO GROUPS Melissa Howes, Steyn's manager, told Fox New Digital that the punitive damages would have to ""face due process scrutiny under U.S. Supreme Court precedent."" She also noted the minimal amount awarded to Mann in compensatory damages. After the verdict was reached, Amy Mitchell, who writes for Steyn's online blog, said it was a loss for the First Amendment. ""Putting aside the monetary damages, the real damage done by this case is to every American who still believes in the First Amendment,"" Mitchell wrote. ""The precedent set today, and as alluded to by Justice Alito when the case was petitioned before the U.S. Supreme Court, means that disagreement and/or criticism of a matter of public policy — the founding principle of this country — is now in doubt. And should you choose to give voice to any dissent, you can brought before a jury, held responsible, and fined."" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP However, Simberg said in a statement that he was ultimately cleared of defaming Mann for ""data manipulation"" and highlighted the low amount of damages he was ordered to pay. ""I am pleased that the jury found in my favor on half of the statements at issue in this case, including finding my statement that Dr. Mann engaged in data manipulation was not defamation,"" Simberg said. ""In over a decade of litigation, the sanctions levied against Dr. Mann dwarf the judgment against me."""

In a letter Monday morning to the chairs and ranking members of top House and Senate committees, 35 ex-officials expressed ""profound concern"" about Biden's LNG export moratorium, outlining how it works against U.S. national security, energy and economic interests. They argued that reversing the policy is ""imperative"" and urged the congressional leaders to take immediate action on the issue. ""This decision, we believe, stands in stark contrast to the clear interests of our nation's economic prosperity, energy security, and the strategic advantage American LNG provides us and our allies across the world who benefit from supply,"" the former U.S. officials wrote. ""American energy has become a stabilizing force in global markets, reinforcing our alliances and promoting global stability. The moratorium on LNG export permits threatens to undo these gains."" ""The United States has provided benefits to a significant part of the world’s population – a role we have been proud to advance as representatives of our Nation,"" they continued. ""We remain committed to the role of the United States as a stabilizing force in global energy markets."" STATE AGS WARN BIDEN'S NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW, DEMAND REVERSAL The signatories on the letter include former Energy Secretaries Spencer Abraham, Rick Perry and Dan Brouillette, former National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Commissioner Bernard McNamee, former White House deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates, and more than two dozen former State Department ambassadors. In their letter, they stressed that LNG exports ensure energy supplies for allies and strengthen the U.S. economy in the form of creating thousands of high-paying jobs, stimulating local economies and generating ""significant tax revenue."" If proposed LNG export projects on pause as a result of Biden's actions don't proceed, such economic benefits would move to foreign nations. ""The cessation of exports risks derailing this progress, impacting workers and communities across the country that have come to rely on the energy sector,"" they wrote. TIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN'S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM Fossil fuel industry groups have recently cited research indicating that LNG exports could add as much as $73 billion to the U.S. economy by 2040, create 453,000 American jobs and increase U.S. purchasing power by $30 billion. Additionally, the ex-officials argued that the ability for greater LNG exports allows energy companies to invest in more domestic infrastructure that would, in turn, support U.S. energy supplies.  And they further stated that limiting LNG exports ""sends the wrong message to our allies, partners and the energy markets."" In the aftermath of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, energy experts argued LNG exports would be critical for helping American allies to wean off Russian gas and, in December, more than 87% of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe, U.K. or Asian markets. REPUBLICANS PROBE CCP-TIED NONPROFIT FUNNELING MONEY TO US ECO GROUPS ""In the aftermath of Russia’s war in Ukraine, alternative supplies are more important than ever to fill the void of Russian natural gas,"" the former officials wrote. ""Security of energy supply, specifically natural gas, is critical to counter the threat of widespread deindustrialization as Europe not only faces war on its continent but also a desire to implement a clean energy transition."" ""Germany’s own steps to rapidly deploy LNG import infrastructure demonstrate this crisis most exceptionally,"" their letter continued. ""They have signed binding contracts for long-term US LNG supply that are now being put into question by our government."" Late last month, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects' carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The action represents a major victory for activists who have loudly called for such a move, even threatening to hold large protests over the issue.

The lawmakers, led by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said the administration's actions — unveiled Friday in a joint announcement by White House and Department of Energy (DOE) officials — will empower Russia and Iran while harming U.S. allies in Europe and Asia. Advocates of LNG exports say the projects are vital to help American allies meet energy demand as nations look to wean off Russian natural gas supplies.  ""American LNG exports have enhanced our geopolitical influence and international energy security across the board since 2016,"" the Republicans wrote in a letter to President Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. ""In addition to Europe, U.S. LNG has a significant impact on energy security in Asia. Japan and South Korea have been the top two destinations for importing U.S. LNG. Taiwan also imports U.S. LNG, and India is rapidly increasing its imports as well."" ""Limiting U.S. LNG exports does not have any impact on the world’s demand for natural gas,"" the letter continued. ""Instead, countries including Russia and Iran will simply produce more energy that is subject to less stringent environmental regulations. As a result, limiting American LNG exports in the name of stopping climate change could do just the opposite and add to global emissions."" BIDEN ADMIN APPEARS TO FABRICATE PAPER TRAIL IN PURSUIT OF MAJOR CHEMICAL PLANT SHUTDOWN: COURT DOCS On Friday morning, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects' carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The move represents a major victory for climate activists who have loudly called for such a move in recent weeks, even threatening to hold civil disobedience protests in Washington, D.C., over the issue. In a statement Friday, the president said the pause on LNG permitting was a part of his sweeping climate agenda, saying the action ""sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time."" He also took aim at ""MAGA Republicans"" for willfully denying the ""urgency of the climate crisis."" ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL ON BIDEN ADMIN TO TANK NATURAL GAS PROJECT AMID NATIONWIDE ARCTIC BLAST While it is unclear which proposed projects the action will affect, a senior administration official said at least two have a larger capacity and two have a smaller capacity. Another official added that the pause implemented Friday will only impact projects that have gone through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) lengthy approval process and are ripe for DOE approval. According to federal data updated this week, there are 11 projects that have been green-lit by FERC but are not yet under construction. An additional four projects are pending before FERC and two are in the pre-filing stage. Those six projects wouldn't be impacted by the pause since they are not before DOE yet, but they would be impacted if approved by FERC. ""We strongly urge you to stop this shortsighted effort,"" Cassidy and the other Republicans concluded in their letter Friday. ""As the President of the United States and as the Secretary of Energy, you should be championing – not undermining – American LNG exports and the environmental, economic, and national security benefits to the United States and our allies."" In addition to Republicans and U.S. fossil fuel industry associations, international energy interests such as Eurogas, the Asia Natural Gas & Energy Association and German state-owned energy company Securing Energy for Europe have argued American natural gas is vital for energy security abroad. BIDEN ADMIN ABRUPTLY REVERSES PROPOSAL OPENING PUBLIC LANDS TO FOREIGN OWNERSHIP AFTER GOP OPPOSITION In the weeks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Biden traveled to Europe and struck a deal with the European Union, vowing to send more U.S. LNG to the bloc. At the time, the White House pledged to ""maintain its regulatory environment,"" a statement that appears to have been contravened with Friday's actions. But LNG export terminals have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who argue they would create harmful pollution and contribute to global warming. The issue has led to activists posting videos on social media which, over the last two months, have generated tens of millions of views.

Overall, e-bikes sparked 267 fires which caused 18 deaths and 150 injuries in the city, according to New York Fire Department (FDNY) data shared with Fox News Digital. The figures represent the highest levels of each statistic, with e-bike related deaths increasing 200%, fires increasing 21% and injuries increasing 2% in the city year over year. ""As we rely more and more on micromobility vehicles to earn a living in our daily lives, we increase the risk of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. And as mentioned, we had over 100 deaths in this city alone on these batteries,"" Democrat New York Mayor Eric Adams said during an event on e-bike safety last year. ""And one of the problems that we've noticed, when you look at those taped-up batteries, you see that they are refurbished,"" he continued. ""These shops are going inside attempting to refurbish the batteries and do it their own way. This is a safety issue."" DEMOCRATS' FAVORITE GREEN MODE OF TRANSPORTATION IS CAUSING EXPLOSIONS, DEATH Amid the uptick in e-bike fires and deaths, New York City leaders led by Adams and FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh — who said last year that e-bikes are ""incredibly dangerous devices"" and called for additional regulation — have spearheaded a public education campaign about the dangers of the device and pushed policies to ensure safety. In March 2023, Adams unveiled the city's Charge Safe, Ride Safe plan to prevent further harmful e-bike incidents. Then, months later, he announced the city had been awarded $25 million in federal funding to install 173 outdoor e-bike charging stations. In December, Adams said his administration would soon launch a battery-charging pilot program for delivery workers. 17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH ""We know these fires can cause serious injury, and even death. We are grateful to our partners in city government for their out-of-the-box thinking on how we can embrace this new technology while also protecting lives,"" Kavanagh said last month. The city government has also passed several laws over the last year to regulate lithium-ion batteries sold in New York City and implemented a policy to expedite investigations into potentially hazardous conditions involving lithium-ion batteries. And the issue led to New York Attorney General Letitia James issuing a consumer alert in June to warn New Yorkers about the ""significant risks"" associated with e-bikes. Still, despite the increased attention on curbing e-bike fires, the FDNY continues to report such incidents.  In the most recent example, an e-bike battery exploded in a Queens bike store, causing a massive blast and two-alarm fire this month. And just days prior, an e-bike battery fire caused an explosion in a public housing complex in the Bronx, killing one person and injuring six others. FDNY Chief of Department John Hodgens previously said that the violent nature of lithium-ion battery-triggered fires makes them harder to quell. HOUSE JOINS SENATE, STRIKES DOWN BIDEN EV CHARGER RULE PROTECTING CHINESE COMPANIES According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), e-bikes are powered by lithium-ion batteries, which are prone to fires or explosions. And as e-bikes continue to become more popular — the global e-bike industry is expected to grow nearly 200% to an estimated value of $118.7 billion by 2030, according to Allied Market Research — cities like New York are facing rapidly increasing numbers of battery fires. ""As the use of lithium-ion-powered products is growing, the challenges with their associated hazards are on full display every day and in communities all across the globe. Lithium-ion batteries are one of the newer and emerging fire threats in our communities,"" Lorraine Carli, NFPA's vice president of outreach and advocacy, said during a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) panel discussion in July. NEW YORK CITY FATAL FIRE WAS CAUSED BY E-BIKE BATTERY, OFFICIALS SAY In October, the CPSC released a staff report showing that micromobility-related injuries have trended upward since 2017, increasing approximately 23% on average every year. One day later, CPSC Commissioner Mary Boyle announced the agency would begin considering regulations targeting e-bikes, which would likely be released in 2025. Meanwhile, Democrat lawmakers continue to push e-bikes as a key part of their climate agenda and effort to decarbonize the U.S. economy. Last year, Reps. Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., Mike Thompson, D-Calif., and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., introduced the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment Act, which would provide Americans with an up to $1,500 credit on e-bike purchases.

Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy announced this month that it closed one of three coal units at Sherburne County Generating Plant, Minnesota’s largest power plant, as part of its plans to deliver 100% carbon-free electricity to customers and shut down all of its remaining coal facilities. The company is planning to retire the two remaining units at the plant and another coal plant in Minnesota, the Allen S. King plant, by 2030. In response to Xcel Energy's shutdown of the unit at Sherburne County Generating Plant and plans to shutter all remaining coal generation, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) fired off a letter urging the company to reconsider those plans. The company — which has pledged to replace the plants with electricity generation from green energy like solar — provides power to customers in both Minnesota and South Dakota. ""The North American Electric Reliability Corporation recently released a long-term risk assessment that showed the MISO region as having a high reliability risk around the time period the plants are planned to be closed,"" SDPUC Chair Kristie Fiegen told Fox News Digital. ""One of the main contributors to that reliability risk is the premature retirement of dispatchable baseload generation before the appropriate replacement resources are added to the system."" ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL ON BIDEN ADMIN TO TANK NATURAL GAS PROJECT AMID NATIONWIDE ARCTIC BLAST ""While Xcel may have plans to replace part of the lost capacity from the early retirements with new solar and storage, the Commission is concerned that the replacement resources will not be dispatchable and, thereby, not as dependable as the Sherco and King plants have been for South Dakota’s customers over the years,"" Fiegen continued. In December, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation — a nonprofit organization that makes periodic recommendations to boost reliability — published its annual Long-Term Reliability Assessment. According to the report, the region managed by Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which oversees much of the Midwest including Minnesota and South Dakota, faces some of the highest grid risks as a result of coal generation retirements that are projected to outpace new green energy development at certain points in the future.  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RIGGED INTERNAL ANALYSIS, SOFTENING BLOW OF POWER PLANT REGULATIONS: REPORT Xcel's shutdown of the Sherburne County Generating Plant and Allen S. King Generating Plant would account for a sizable share of that existing coal generation scheduled to soon be taken offline. The two plants have a total capacity of nearly 3,000 megawatts, enough to power more than a million homes. MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris, though, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that the grid operator is both fuel agnostic and policy neutral and would continue to support the clean energy goals of its states and member utilities ""across a diverse and complex system undergoing an energy transition while also maintaining system reliability."" Under Xcel's plans, it will build a 710-megawatt solar farm at the site of the Sherburne County Generating Plant and solar projects with a total capacity of 650 megawatts to replace the Allen S. King Generating Plant. However, those plans wouldn't produce enough power to replace the electricity generation of the two retiring coal facilities and would further represent intermittent forms of power that are dependent on weather conditions. ""Being in a northern climate, the Commission’s main concern is that there are enough dispatchable resources on the system to meet South Dakotans’ winter heating loads during long cold spells when there is a chance that renewable resources are not producing energy,"" Fiegen added. ""Keeping the lights on and making sure we have a reliable, affordable electric grid is one of our greatest priorities at the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission."" ""Premature closure of reliable baseload energy could put lives at risk if the electric system isn’t ready to absorb those retirements,"" she said. ""To this Commission, the NERC risk assessment is a flashing, bright-red warning light that there is good chance this could be the case."" MICHIGAN DEMS, GRETCHEN WHITMER ARE PURSUING A GREEN NEW DEAL, THREATENING FUTURE GRID STABILITY Energy experts have long warned that replacing fossil fuel power generation with green energy could present risks, since those alternatives produce a smaller share of their listed capacity.  Solar panels, for example, produce just 25% and wind turbines produce 34% of their listed capacity, according to federal data. Coal, natural gas and nuclear power plants, meanwhile, produce 49%, 54% and 93% of their listed capacity, respectively. ""You have people in hospitals, you have low-income people who are affected. You have farmers, you have small businesses,"" Michelle Bloodworth, the president and CEO of America’s Power, a coal power trade group, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""They certainly, obviously, rely upon electricity, whether that's for health and human safety."" ""But, also, coal provides an insurance policy when either other resources, like intermittent, are not available, or natural gas prices. We saw a lot of high natural gas prices. Consumers can put food on the table instead of having to spend a significant portion of their income — which they really can't afford to — on their electricity bill which, as we are seeing, continue to climb across the United States."" CONSUMER GROUP LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TARGETING ENERGY COMPANY PUSHING ESG MEASURES Overall, Xcel — whose largest shareholders include BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, massive asset managers which have forwarded so-called environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives — has issued some of the most aggressive corporate sustainability goals of any developer in the nation, vowing to lower its electricity emissions 80% by 2030 and fully decarbonize its electricity generation by 2040.  Those goals, according to Xcel, are based on United Nations climate projections and targets. And to achieve its goals, Xcel has pledged to shutter fossil fuel power generation and vastly expand its green energy development while maintaining the size of its existing nuclear power fleet. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Xcel Energy spokesperson Theo Keith said the company appreciated the SDPUC's feedback, but that it is in alignment with the commission’s ""priority to ensure reliability throughout the clean energy transition and ensure South Dakotans have a dependable supply of electricity at all times, including periods of extreme weather and high demand."" BLACKROCK TURNED DOWN RECORD NUMBER OF CLIMATE PROPOSALS AMID INFLATION, ESG PUSHBACK ""As we retire our coal plants, we plan to add 2,150 megawatts of wind and 2,500 megawatts of solar onto our Upper Midwest system by 2032, with another 1,100 megawatts of wind and solar capacity slated for beyond 2032,"" Keith said. ""While the power generated by these resources is variable, we will complement it with ‘dispatchable’ generation — power we can supply at any time it’s needed — to reinforce the reliability of the grid.""  ""Ensuring a reliable, clean and affordable energy future is a complex task, and the knowledge and perspective of the commission will contribute to our shared success,"" he added. ""We look forward to continuing to meet with the commission and discuss the path forward."" According to Keith, Xcel's nuclear fleet will continue to provide dispatchable power generation, the company plans to build new dispatchable generation, mainly hydrogen-ready combustion turbines, and Xcel will also construct up to 700 miles of new transmission lines. ""Utility companies are becoming increasingly aggressive in their pursuit of so-called ‘sustainability efforts.’ As part of their ESG priorities, Xcel is claiming to be a leader in the ‘energy transition’ and to provide consumers with ‘safe’ and ‘reliable’ energy at a competitive price,"" Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumer's Research, told Fox News Digital.  ""Yet, their plan to close the King and Sherco generating plants would not only hike energy costs in the MISO area but threaten reliable energy for consumers in an area that is already at high-risk,"" Hild continued. ""Just like other ESG advocates, Xcel claims to protect the consumers they serve while pulling the rug right from beneath them."" ""Unsurprisingly, Xcel's largest shareholders are made up of the biggest champions of the ESG cult: BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street."""

In a short six-page ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit tossed an August 2022 decision from Judge Brian Morris of the U.S. District of Montana reinstating the 2016 moratorium. The National Mining Association (NMA), which led the appeal of the 2022 lower court decision alongside the States of Montana and Wyoming, cheered the ruling Wednesday as a victory for American energy. ""This is a victory for American-mined energy and we are pleased with the court’s recognition of the need to dismiss this irreparably flawed ruling,"" NMA President and CEO Rich Nolan said in a statement. ""With this ruling, important projects can once again advance and support the production of affordable, reliable power to the grid, while creating jobs and economic development across the country, helping federal, state and localities with necessary funding by contributing hundreds of millions each year in revenues to state and local governments,"" he added. FEDERAL COURT JAMS BRAKES ON BIDEN ADMIN'S EFFORT TO SHUT DOWN MAJOR PETROCHEMICAL PLANT Although current DOI Secretary Deb Haaland revoked Zinke's secretarial actions shortly after taking office in 2021, it stopped short of reinstating the coal leasing moratorium. But, at the same time, environmental groups continued litigating a challenge to the Zinke order, leading to the 2022 ruling which blocked that order despite the fact that the Biden administration had already rescinded it.  TOP HOUSE COMMITTEE PROBES JOHN KERRY'S COORDINATION WITH ECO GROUPS PUSHING COAL POWER SHUTDOWN In 2016, under the leadership of then-Secretary Sally Jewell, the Department of the Interior (DOI) issued a first-of-its-kind moratorium on all new coal leases on federal land. Then, one year later, former DOI Secretary Ryan Zinke rescinded that order shortly after being confirmed to the position by the Senate, stating ""the public interest is not served by halting the federal coal program for an extended time."" Counsel for NMA and the States of Montana and Wyoming argued in court earlier this month that the Biden administration's actions rendered the case moot and, therefore, the 2016 moratorium dead. REPUBLICAN STATE SUES BIDEN ADMIN OVER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ACTIONS: 'DYSTOPIAN NIGHTMARE' The panel's ruling Wednesday sided with the arguments presented by NMA, Montana and Wyoming. ""The Zinke order and its [environmental] analysis present no case or controversy and are moot because current Interior Secretary Haaland vacated them long before the district court purported to do so a second time and plaintiffs have not challenged that Haaland order,"" NMA attorney James Auslander said in oral arguments before the Ninth Circuit on Feb. 6, Courthouse News Service reported. ""The district court reasoned that the Haaland Order’s failure to reinstate the coal leasing moratorium from the Jewell Order meant that ‘the Zinke Order still remains in partial effect,’"" the ruling states. ""That is incorrect."" ""The Haaland Order definitively ‘revoked’ the Zinke Order,"" it continues. ""While appellees may be dissatisfied with the government’s position that the Haaland Order did not revive the Jewell Order’s moratorium, this does not provide a basis for concluding that a challenge to the defunct Zinke Order is live."" Following the ruling, environmental plaintiffs in the case — including activist groups Earthjustice, Montana Environmental Information Center, Center for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club and WildEarth Guardians — lamented the decision's implications and called for the Biden administration to take immediate action banning coal leasing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""This decision could throw the doors open to coal leasing on federal lands at the very same time that we need to be rapidly transitioning to clean energy,"" said Taylor McKinnon, of the Center for Biological Diversity.

Still, Daniel Turner, the executive director of energy watchdog group Power the Future, said the storm's impact could foreshadow future threats to the U.S. power grid if the nation transitions to a heavy reliance on solar energy. ""There's this enormous shell game happening by the Biden administration, by the environmental left, presenting wind and solar as perfectly green, clean, and carbon-neutral,"" Turner told Fox News Digital. ""They use all of these buzzwords. But they're none of that and they also have enormous drawbacks. And it's doing the American people a great disservice to obfuscate these very obvious shortcomings."" He noted that, because solar panels are largely manufactured in China, the destruction of solar farms could be leveraged in geopolitical disputes between the U.S. and China. ""Why would we expect them to race to our aid when our grid is down nationwide, and they are the ones holding the goods that we need to get back up?"" Turner said.

The destruction of the project, meanwhile, comes as the nation broadly races to replace existing fossil fuel power with green energy alternatives. But those plans have been criticized by experts who warn of those energy sources' reliance on certain windy and sunny weather conditions."

MARCO RUBIO LEADS EFFORT TO BLOCK CLEAN ENERGY CREDITS FROM AUTOMAKERS THAT OFFSHORE JOBS Rubio's joint resolution would overturn the president's Waiver of Buy America Requirements for Electric Vehicle Chargers. Rubio, the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and other Republican lawmakers argued the waiver would ultimately benefit Chinese manufacturers who dominate the EV charger supply chain. In February 2023, the Transportation Department (DOT) unveiled the final Made in America EV charger waiver rule which axed more stringent requirements and pushed certain deadlines back months in a major victory for green energy industry groups. The waiver governs manufacturing and assembly requirements for EV charging companies to be eligible for millions of dollars in federal subsidies. The waiver rules revised a stricter proposal put forth by DOT in August 2022. The four-phase proposed waiver would have immediately scrapped all requirements; then required EV charger companies to assemble all products in the U.S. beginning Jan. 1, 2023; manufacture chargers with no less than 25% American-made components by cost beginning July 1, 2023; and manufacture chargers with no less than 55% American-made components by cost beginning Jan. 1, 2024. The finalized waiver knocked it down to a two-phase process and pushed key deadlines. It requires EV charger companies to ensure final assembly of chargers is in the U.S. and that the cost of American-made components in chargers represents 55% of total product costs beginning on July 1, 2024. The waiver notably scrapped the 25% domestic component requirement.

BIDEN ADMIN APPEARS TO FABRICATE PAPER TRAIL IN PURSUIT OF MAJOR CHEMICAL PLANT SHUTDOWN: COURT DOCS Republican lawmakers, led by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., informed the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had opened an investigation into the agency's controversial proposed rule change allowing for a new type of public company, so-called Natural Asset Companies (NACs), to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). ""The Committee is deeply concerned with the potential impact NACs may have on the management of federal lands, effective conservation of wildlife habitat, and responsible development of natural resources,"" the House Republicans wrote in their letter, which was addressed to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and Haoxiang Zhu, the director of the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets. NACs are a type of company that is chartered to ""protect, restore and grow the natural assets under their management to foster healthy ecosystems,"" according to the Intrinsic Exchange Group, which collaborated with the NYSE to develop the new corporate taxonomy. If finalized, the rule would allow NACs to be traded publicly. ""Most notably, the proposed rule would allow private investment interests to control and manage national parks and other publicly owned lands — an unprecedented power-grab and usurpation of federal authority,"" they continued. ""This possibility is alarming, but, when coupled with the proposal’s arbitrary designations and ill-defined terms, it may prove calamitous to the statutory multiple-use mandates of federal lands and responsible development of America’s natural resources."" Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, Congress established the so-called ""multiple-use"" and sustained yield mandate. The law requires the Department of the Interior to open the lands it manages for various uses, including energy development, grazing, recreation and mining. BIDEN ADMIN ISSUES 20-YEAR MINING BAN AS IT TURNS TO FOREIGN SUPPLY CHAIN AMID GREEN ENERGY PUSH But the Republicans further warned in their letter Thursday that activity on federal lands controlled by NACs will be ""determined by the whims of eco-activists"" rather than Congress or government scientists. And they said NACs could lead to the offshoring of energy production to countries with poor human rights and environmental records while opening the door to foreign ownership of public property. However, environmentalists have lobbied for the federal government to open lands up for conservation purposes, a move the Bureau of Land Management is actively pursuing and which would align with the SEC's NAC proposal.  According to NYSE — which argues that NACs ""capture the intrinsic and productive value of nature and provide a store of value based on the vital assets that underpin our entire economy and make life on earth possible"" — natural assets that could be grouped into a NAC include forests, wetlands and coral reefs, as well as working lands such as farms. ""Additionally, as part of the Committee’s ongoing oversight of foreign interests that attempt to influence America’s environmental, natural resource, and energy policies, the Committee is concerned with allowing foreign investment into America’s most precious assets,"" Westerman and the other lawmakers concluded.  ""For example, allowing foreign interests to fund companies that will control public land and explicitly prohibit domestic mineral production is a surefire way to increase our nation’s critical mineral dependance while weakening America’s economic competitiveness, our national security and that of our allies,"" they wrote. ""This is unacceptable."" BIDEN ADMIN MAKES STUNNING ADMISSION ON CLIMATE AGENDA IN LEAKED INTERNAL MEMO An SEC spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement that Gensler would respond to the Natural Resources Committee Republicans directly. The probe comes less than a month after the SEC agreed to delay its rulemaking on the issue and allow stakeholders more time to weigh in on the proposal. The delay was requested by Republican state financial officers from 22 states who requested a ""reasonable public comment process,"" instead of a rushed process. Led by Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes and Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, a group of 25 attorneys general submitted comments with the SEC earlier this week, calling for the agency to rescind its NAC proposal. STATE COURT DELIVERS MAJOR SETBACK TO DELAWARE IN CLIMATE CHANGE LAWSUIT AGAINST BIG OIL ""The recognition of national asset companies would be a disastrous development. It would violate multiple laws, would prohibit productive economic uses of relevant land, and would facilitate the effective takeover of public lands by private entities and foreign actors,"" Kobach told Fox News Digital on Thursday. ""We intend to prevent this from happening."" ""NACs present national security risks because foreign adversaries could invest in a NAC and lock up our natural resources,"" added Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks. ""This would lead to greater dependence on foreign countries for essential resources, to say nothing of the potential scarcity this might create."" Oaks said that NACs would essentially ""financialize"" non-economic natural processes like photosynthesis and other life-giving processes.  In addition, Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers' Research, said NACs presented a series of dangers for Americans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""It is hard to overstate the danger that so-called 'natural asset companies' pose to the livelihood of millions of Americans,"" Hild told Fox News Digital. ""Big woke corporations including BlackRock and foreign companies from hostile nations such as China would be handed free rein to buy up millions of acres of public land."" ""Ranching, farming, energy production and many other critical industries would be denied shared access to public land, eliminating their productive use,"" he added. ""Even people who use public lands for recreation and hunting could suddenly find their access taken away."""

The memo, obtained by Fox News Digital, states the so-called Choice in Automobile Retail Sales (CARS) Act would undermine the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ability to protect Americans from ""dangerous air pollution"" and adds such pollution causes thousands of premature deaths every year. The House Rules Committee green-lit the bill earlier this week, teeing up a floor vote Wednesday. ""Democrats are fighting to protect Americans’ right to clean air and a safe climate, protect public health, and support EPA’s mandate to address dangerous pollution from the transportation sector,"" the memo states. ""Over 100 million Americans live in counties with unhealthy air pollution, with children, the elderly, low income communities, and communities of color being disproportionately at risk. Air pollution is associated with over 100,000 premature deaths in the United States every year."" ""Republicans are employing scare tactics to deliberately mislead the American people about EVs in order to prop up Big Oil corporations,"" it continues. ""The reality is that EVs are already popular, cheaper to own, and ongoing technological advancements are translating to better options for consumers every year."" HOUSE SET TO HOLD VOTE ON BILL STRIKING DOWN BIDEN'S EV PUSH: 'RADICAL AND UNATTAINABLE' The memo is being circulated by Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee led by Ranking Member Frank Pallone, D-N.J., who has advocated for an aggressive green energy transition. The CARS Act — introduced over the summer by Reps. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., and Andrew Clyde, R-Ga. — would block regulations the EPA proposed in April that would significantly increase tailpipe emissions standards for gas-powered cars. The bill would also prohibit any rule mandating the use of a specific technology or regulations that limit the availability of new vehicles based on engine type. FORD DRAMATICALLY SCALES BACK EV PLANT AMID PLUMMETING SALES IN BLOW TO BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY GOALS In addition to arguing that continued reliance on gas cars may lead to more premature deaths, the memo pushed back on Republicans' arguments that the EPA actions amount to an ""EV mandate."" It notes that automakers are announcing their own EV manufacturing goals independent of federal regulations. However, if the EPA rule is finalized, the White House projected that a staggering 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck, and up to 50% of bus and garbage truck purchases could be electric by 2032. It also said the new standards would ""accelerate the transition to electric vehicles,"" likely because it would raise the price of gas-powered cars, making them cost-competitive with pricey EVs. ""Auto Innovators does not believe [the proposed standards] can be met without substantially increasing the cost of vehicles, reducing consumer choice, and disadvantaging major portions of the United States population,"" John Bozzella, the CEO of the large auto industry group Alliance for Automotive Innovation which supports EVs, said after the EPA published its proposal in April. ""Taken together, the proposed GHG and criteria pollutant standards are so stringent as to set a de facto BEV mandate,"" he added. Opponents of EPA's actions — which are part of the Biden administration's broader effort to increase EV ownership in the U.S. and fight global warming by curbing carbon emissions produced by the transportation sector — have argued the new standards would ultimately harm consumers through higher costs and by forcing them to buy certain vehicles. STUDY CASTS DOUBT ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES' CLIMATE, COST BENEFITS: 'WON'T ACHIEVE THE GOALS INTENDED' They have also argued that a large EV push will benefit Chinese industry which currently dominates global EV battery supply chains. ""Voting for the CARS Act and taking a stand against EPA’s de facto ban on most new gasoline, diesel, flex fuel and hybrid vehicles should not be a partisan issue for members of the House,"" American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers Vice President of Government Relations Aaron Ringel told Fox News Digital. ""Banning vehicle and fuel technologies based on just one category of emissions is unlawful, illogical and bad for consumers, families and our national security. It would trade our hard-earned energy security for dependence on China."" ""The CARS Act will preserve consumer choice and allow individuals and families to continue selecting the cars and trucks that work best for them,"" Ringel said. ""Under this legislation, EPA would retain the ability to set ambitious, technology-neutral vehicle emission standards, but those standards may not be manipulated to force vehicle electrification or limit access to any vehicle powertrains."" He also cited polling data indicating 60% of Americans oppose the EPA's proposal. And he took aim at messaging defending the proposal. ""With regard to how some are messaging against the CARS Act, it’s silly to try and spin EPA’s proposal as anything other than a mandate and de facto ban,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""People across the political and news spectrums acknowledge that the point of EPA’s proposal is to force electrification."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""But if electric vehicles were really the more affordable, convenient option for consumers and the market, EPA’s proposal wouldn’t be necessary,"" Ringel concluded. ""The proposal — which will eliminate most vehicle models that run all or in part on American-made, American-grown liquid fuels — is meant to force consumers in a direction they’re not asking to go, toward prices they do not want to pay."" The White House said in a statement Monday that President Biden would veto the CARS Act if it were passed. If the House approves the bill Wednesday, it will move to the Senate where it has already received bipartisan support."

In a series of unexpected announcements on Thursday, JPMorgan Chase, the world's largest bank, and State Street Global Advisors, an institutional investor with $3.5 trillion in assets under management, withdrew from the so-called Climate Action 100+ investor group. At the same time, BlackRock, which has more than $10 trillion in assets under management, dramatically scaled back its involvement in the alliance. ""This is great news because you're supposed to make investment decisions based on just good common business sense, your fiduciary responsibility to your investors, not based on left-wing woke politics,"" Jordan told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""So, yeah, this is a win for America, a win for the economy, a win for Americans and investors and, more importantly, it's a win for freedom."" ""The folks who are involved in these banks are smart people, successful people. They've done well. I think deep down they know decisions should be based on the market, on principles of capitalism, not on politics,"" he added. CONSUMER GROUP REVEALS LEFT-WING GROUPS INCREASINGLY USING COURTS TO PUSH GREEN NEW DEAL Under Jordan's leadership, the House Judiciary Committee launched a sprawling investigation into what he dubbed the ""climate-obsessed corporate ‘cartel’"" in December 2022 as Republicans prepared to take majority control of the chamber. The panel's main objective has been to probe whether the financial sector, aided by nonprofit activist climate groups, are violating U.S. antitrust laws. As part of the initial effort, Jordan and several fellow House Republicans penned a letter to the Steering Committee for Climate Action 100+, demanding information about the coalition’s network of influence. The letter stated that the alliance ""seems to work like a cartel to ‘ensure the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take necessary action on climate change.’"" BILLIONAIRE-FUELED ROCKEFELLER FUND COORDINATED CLIMATE LAWSUITS WITH DEM STATE AG: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS Since then, Jordan's committee has expanded the investigation, firing off inquiries into BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, in addition to nonprofits Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. And late last year he issued subpoenas to BlackRock and State Street, compelling the production of documents related to his investigation into potential antitrust violations. ""I think we've done more subpoenas and more interviews and written more letters than probably most of the rest of Congress combined,"" Jordan told Fox News Digital. ""We have been pushing for stopping this kind of coordination and collusion that we think is harmful to the economy, to freedom, to investors,"" the Judiciary Committee chair continued. ""So, you know, we're just doing our job, and we're happy to see that three huge banks — the decision they made today, and I think, as I said before, it's a win for the country."" Climate Action 100+ was formally established in December 2017 at the United Nations as a way of aligning the world's largest private sector financiers of greenhouse gas emitters. Since the association was created, it has grown to include more than 700 financial institutions that are collectively responsible for a staggering $68 trillion in assets under management. The group, which is overseen by a nongovernmental steering committee comprised of ESG activists, calls for members to engage companies on ""improving climate change governance,"" curbing carbon emissions and strengthening climate-related financial disclosure policies. Its actions have largely taken aim at investments that benefit the oil and gas industry while boosting green energy investment strategies. MEET THE LITTLE-KNOWN GROUP FUNDED BY LEFT-WING DARK MONEY THAT IS SHAPING FEDERAL CLIMATE POLICY But in June 2023, Climate Action 100+ unveiled its ""phase 2"" strategy, which calls for member investors to actively engage with companies to reduce their carbon footprint. That program, slated to be implemented in the coming months, sparked concerns from State Street and BlackRock. ""After careful review, State Street Global Advisors has concluded the enhanced Climate Action 100+ Phase 2 requirements for signatories will not be consistent with our independent approach to proxy voting and portfolio company engagement,"" State Street Global Advisors said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""As a result, we have decided to withdraw from Climate Action 100+."" BlackRock similarly said in a note Thursday that the ""phase 2"" strategy caused it to withdraw its U.S. business from Climate Action 100+ in recent weeks, instead shifting involvement in the alliance to its smaller international entity where a majority of clients are pursuing decarbonization goals. ""This new strategy will require signatories to make an overarching commitment to use client assets to pursue emissions reductions in investee companies through stewardship engagement,"" the firm stated. ""In our judgment, making this new commitment across our assets under management would raise legal considerations, particularly in the U.S."" ""The majority of the firm’s clients who are seeking investment solutions that help them meet their climate, transition and decarbonization commitments are clients of our international businesses,"" it added. ""To align with these clients and funds, we have transferred our membership in CA100+ to BlackRock International. BlackRock Inc. is no longer a member of CA100+."" UNITED NATIONS FOUNDATION IS QUIETLY FUELING CLIMATE POLICY, FUNDING STAFF IN DEM STATES And JPMorgan Chase separately explained that it quit the global investor group because of the expansion of its own in-house sustainability team and the establishment of its climate-risk framework in recent years. Climate Action 100+, in addition to other global climate alliances and investor networks, has also drawn the ire of Republican states, which have argued that their activities may infringe on government policymaking. They have also warned that such associations are harming domestic energy companies that employ thousands of Americans and ensure low consumer prices. As a result, state attorneys general, financial officers and agriculture commissioners have banded together in recent months to threaten legal action related to nonprofit climate alliances and banks' involvement in such groups. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""More than 700 investors are committed to managing climate risk and preserving shareholder value through their participation in the initiative,"" a spokesperson for Climate Action 100+ told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

The International Code Council (ICC) — a Washington, D.C.-based group that regularly issues more than a dozen codes regulating new construction and impacting billions of people worldwide — is expected to finalize its 2024 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) early next week. While previous IECCs received little opposition, the 2024 version has been widely criticized for prioritizing climate initiatives over energy efficiency. ""They're incentivizing electrification and discriminating against the natural gas industry by excluding it from being part of the code,"" Karen Harbert, the president and CEO of the American Gas Association (AGA), told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""That really is anticompetitive behavior."" ""If you are about energy efficiency, you should say, ‘We are about energy efficiency however you get there’ — being fuel neutral. But in this case, they are prescribing the way to get there, and it only includes electrification."" BIDEN INVOKES WARTIME POWERS TO FUND ELECTRIC HEATERS AS HE CRACKS DOWN ON GAS APPLIANCES AGA, whose members provide natural gas service to 180 million customers nationwide, has argued in recent months that the ICC developed its 2024 energy efficiency code with ""serious lapses in due process"" by not involving them. It further said the code would harm consumers and lead to higher costs. The leading gas industry group, other energy industry associations, housing groups and the ICC's own Northeast regional branch filed appeals in late December and early January asking for a revision to the 2024 IECC. However, the ICC's appeals board recommended this month that those appeals be rejected, leaving the group's board of directors with the final decision. That's expected to come Monday. EXPERTS WARN BIDEN ADMIN'S WATER HEATER CRACKDOWN WILL HIKE PRICES, REDUCE CONSUMER CHOICE Among the provisions opposed, the draft IECC, which has been in development for years, requires new one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses to install electrical infrastructure for home electric vehicle chargers. It also mandates that new homes are equipped with the electrical wiring needed for a solar panel system and all-electric appliances. According to the AGA, those measures and other provisions were largely included in the IECC as part of an omnibus package in September 2022 after rejection through the normal process. ""The activists that are supporting an all-electrification agenda tried to come in through the policy front door, which was to ban natural gas in cities, and that got overturned in the Ninth Circuit,"" Harbert told Fox News Digital. ""They tried to ban gas at the state level, and that's now being challenged. And they have tried to do it through regulation and have been unsuccessful."" ""So, you go to a process that is very much under the radar, very wonky, very technical, but with the same objectives,"" she continued, referencing the IECC process. ""You come in the front door, you come in the side door, now you're coming in the back door."" In addition to AGA, the American Public Gas Association, the appliance manufacturer trade group Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) and the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) also filed appeals to the 2024 IECC. BIDEN ADMIN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TARGETING HOME APPLIANCES WITH ECO REGULATIONS IN 2023 ""As long-standing supporters of the ICC codes and standards, we are concerned that this version of the IECC misses the mark,"" Paula Cino, NMHC's vice president for construction, development, land use and counsel, told Fox News Digital in a written statement.  ""Without action from the ICC Board to cabin provisions that exceed the bounds of the code, this IECC would threaten housing affordability and weigh renters down with costs for unwanted or unusable technologies,"" she added. In its December appeal filed jointly with BOMA, NMHC particularly criticized the IECC's electric vehicle charging provision and another provision requiring new homes to have so-called demand responsive controls for water heating equipment, allowing a third party to reduce a home's energy consumption in times of high demand. NMHC and BOMA argued that the 2024 IECC would place additional costs on Americans, including low-income families. And the ICC's Region IV branch, which covers the Northeast, also warned of the potential negative economic consequences of the 2024 IECC. BIDEN ADMIN'S WAR ON HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES WILL CAUSE HIGHER PRICES, DIRTIER CLOTHES AND DISHES, EXPERTS WARN Overall, jurisdictions across 48 states and representing more than 119 million Americans administer the IECC. ICC CEO Dominic Sims said late last year that the code is an essential tool for ""achieving energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction goals."" ""The model building energy code before the International Code Council represents a consensus agreement among builders, building code officials, and energy efficiency advocates,"" said Jennifer Amann, a senior fellow at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which advocates for electrification policies. ""It will cut energy waste in new homes, lower utility bills for homeowners, and reduce pollution."" The debate over the group's energy conservation code comes amid a broader push from environmental organizations to electrify the residential and commercial sector, which accounts for the largest share of total end-use carbon emissions of any sector in the U.S. Activists and Democrat-led local governments have sought to ban natural gas hookups as part of that effort, replacing gas-powered stoves, water heaters and furnaces with electric alternatives. ""The International Code Council’s board should approve this commonsense proposal and not bend to special interests representing polluting industries,"" she told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At the same time, the Biden administration has implemented a series of regulations cracking down on popular home appliances, forcing them to be more efficient. It has also earmarked $1 billion under the Inflation Reduction Act for grants helping local jurisdictions implement the ICC's IECC.

Gotion Inc. – whose parent company, Gotion High-Tech is based in Hefei, China, and has documented ties to the Chinese Communist Party – filed a breach-of-contract complaint against Green Charter Township in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The lawsuit is the latest escalation in a months-long feud between Gotion and Green Charter officials who have pumped the brakes on the company's proposed project within the town's jurisdiction. ""We are saddened and disappointed by their decision to proceed in this direction,"" Green Charter Supervisor Jason Kruse told Fox News Digital in a written statement. ""As Township Supervisor, my number one concern is protecting the interests of the people of Green Charter Township, and we will vigorously defend our township’s position in this matter,"" Kruse added. ""We might be a small community, but we refuse to be bullied."" BIDEN ADMIN GREEN-LIGHTS CHINESE EV BATTERY FACTORY IN MICHIGAN, DESPITE LOCAL OPPOSITION According to the lawsuit, Kruse and other elected Green Charter leaders have pursued unlawful actions against the company and are ""motivated by clear anti-Gotion animus."" Gotion asked the court to reinstate permits canceled by the township, thereby allowing its battery project to move forward, and further filed a motion for preliminary injunction, requesting that the court intervene quickly. ""It’s unfortunate that Gotion has had to resort to litigation to get the township to comply with their obligations under the agreement,"" Chuck Thelen, Gotion’s vice president of North American operations, said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. ""We’re unable to comment further since this is now an ongoing legal matter."" NRSC AD PUTS DEM REP ON BLAST FOR SIGNING HUSH AGREEMENT INVOLVING CCP-TIED COMPANY The issue dates back to October 2022, when Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Gotion would invest $2.4 billion to construct two large production plants along with other supporting facilities spanning 260 acres in Green Charter, which is located in northwestern Michigan. Whitmer said the project would shore up Michigan's status as the ""global hub of mobility and electrification."" Under the economic development package awarded to Gotion, the company is set to receive $175 million in taxpayer-funded incentives and more than $500 million in tax incentives. However, the project has generated substantial local uproar, with residents repeatedly expressing concern about Gotion's ties to China and calling on the Whitmer administration to cancel the project. For example, the projects' opponents have noted Gotion High-Tech's corporate bylaws require the company to ""carry out Party activities in accordance with the Constitution of the Communist Party of China."" In addition, Gotion High-Tech hosted multiple company trips in 2021 to CCP revolutionary memorials in Anhui Province, China. During the trips, Gotion High-Tech workers wore Red Army outfits and pledged to ""fight for communism to the end of my life."" ALABAMA REJECTED CCP-TIED EV COMPANY'S PROJECT THAT BLUE STATES EVENTUALLY GREEN-LIT On Dec. 13, 2022, Green Charter Township approved a resolution in support of Gotion's project. Months later, in August 2023, the township authorized then-Supervisor James Chapman to privately negotiate the terms of a development agreement with Gotion, that is required to approve certain infrastructure at the site of the project. That agreement was executed between Gotion and Green Charter on Oct. 10, 2023. But, while the town pursued the agreement and negotiations with Gotion, local residents simultaneously organized a recall effort that proved successful in early November 2023. Every member of the town board, including Chapman, was ousted. After Kruse and the other new members of the board took office, they immediately rescinded the October development agreement. ""The Development Agreement was and remains a legally binding agreement between Gotion and the Township,"" Gotion's federal lawsuit states. HOUSE CCP PANEL PROBES BIDEN ADMIN OVER CHINESE GREEN ENERGY PROJECT ON US SOIL After the lawsuit was filed, meanwhile, Gotion was blasted by former U.S. Ambassadors Peter Hoekstra and Joseph Cella, who have led opposition to the company's plans over national security concerns. Last year, the pair founded the Michigan-China Economic and Security Review Group, a watchdog group devoted to reviewing Chinese economic investments across the country with a particular focus on Michigan. ""PRC-based and CCP-tied Gotion continues to carry on every bit the way a company based in authoritarian Communist China would – in secrecy, heavy handedness, above the law operations, and reckless disregard for the environment,"" they said in a joint statement Monday. ""Gotion, a $40 billion company, does not like the fact five elected officials who rolled over for them were recalled, and now they are suing over alleged 'breach of contract' to get the results they want, contrary to the will of the people."" ""These are every day citizens from both sides of the aisle in Green Township that are fighting this,"" they added. ""They are simply seeking to de-risk from this type of subnational incursion from Gotion that our national security and intelligence operations have warned present a national security threat, and preserve their pristine natural surroundings, water, and habitats. This is precisely why every day hard working Americans distrust government and business elites.""

In an announcement late last month, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Kerry would soon step down from his role at the State Department and that clean energy czar John Podesta would ""continue to lead our global climate efforts"" in a new role helping the world transition to green energy. But the White House said Podesta would take on the role of senior adviser to the president for international climate policy. While Kerry will step down as special presidential envoy for climate (SPEC), Biden will not nominate a direct replacement, and Kerry's staff will report to another State Department official while Podesta coordinates policy with the SPEC office from the White House. The arrangement allows Podesta to sidestep a congressionally mandated Senate confirmation since the SPEC role will technically be left vacant. ""Upon Secretary Kerry’s departure, the existing SPEC state team will report to Rich Verma, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources,"" a White House official told Fox News Digital. ""John will continue to oversee the White House Office of Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation while working closely with the State Department."" TOP REPUBLICANS BLAST BIDEN FOR REPLACING JOHN KERRY WITH JOHN PODESTA, WHO CALLED CCP OFFICIAL 'FRIEND' Shortly after taking office in 2021, Biden appointed Kerry to be the first-ever SPEC, a role that granted him a spot in the president's cabinet and National Security Council but didn't require a Senate confirmation vote.  However, in part because of Kerry's appointment, Congress passed a provision in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, which Biden signed into law in December 2021, prohibiting the president from appointing any State Department special envoy ""without the advice and consent of the Senate."" JOHN KERRY'S CLIMATE OFFICE FACES GOP OVERSIGHT PROBE OVER COORDINATION WITH ECO GROUP 'KITCHEN CABINET' In response to the White House's maneuver skirting Senate confirmation for Podesta, several more moderate Democrats, including senators Jon Tester, D-Mont.; Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; Bob Casey, D-Pa.; and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., in addition to Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who caucuses with Democrats, were all silent. The lawmakers either ignored or declined to comment when contacted by Fox News Digital. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Md., didn't respond to requests for comment. ""Any appointed administration official that will heavily rely on State Department staff and resources should be accountable to congressional committees with jurisdiction over State, including the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,"" Jim Risch, R-Idaho, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""It is not unprecedented for someone serving in the White House to go through Senate confirmation,"" he added. ""If the Biden administration would like for the role of senior adviser for international climate policy to be effective, it should send Mr. Podesta’s appointment to our committee for consideration."" BIDEN ADMIN SUED FOR HIDING JOHN KERRY'S STAFF, COORDINATION WITH ECO GROUPS John Barrasso, R-Wyo., ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, added that Biden knows Podesta would never survive Senate confirmation. ""John Podesta is a John Kerry clone. He will peddle more of the same attacks on American energy,"" Barrasso told Fox News Digital. ""He will protect China’s status as a free rider on international climate agreements. Joe Biden knows Podesta’s radical ideas could never stand up to the scrutiny of Senate confirmation."" And Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who serves as the ranking member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy, noted that Podesta has a documented history with officials tied to the Chinese Communist Party. ""John Podesta runs a think-tank funded by big tech, he’s spent years working for dark-money climate activists, and has said he has the ‘highest regard’ for CCP officials,"" Hawley told Fox News Digital. ""This man should be nowhere near the federal government, so it’s no shock the Biden Administration wants to avoid Senate confirmation and a public eye on their terrible pick.""   FORMER CIA DIRECTOR LEON PANETTA WARNS CHINA MAY USE MICHIGAN EV PLANT FOR ESPIONAGE According to emails previously reviewed by Fox News Digital, Podesta held multiple meetings in 2015 and 2016 with Tung Chee-hwa, the longtime vice chair of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He also engaged with the high-ranking Chinese official years prior while leading the Center for American Progress, the think tank he founded in 2003, even referring to him as his ""friend from Hong Kong."" Since taking on the SPEC position, Kerry has traveled worldwide, attending high-profile climate summits and diplomatic engagements in an effort to push a global transition from fossil fuels to green energy alternatives. However, his office has remained tight-lipped about its internal operations and staff members, sparking criticism from lawmakers who have demanded greater transparency. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The SPEC office is housed at the State Department and has an estimated $13.9 million annual budget with approval for 45 personnel, the majority of whom are unknown. In September 2022, Biden appointed Podesta to lead implementation of the billions of dollars in green energy program funding earmarked in the Inflation Reduction Act. Podesta then staffed his office with several left-wing climate activists."

In an announcement, James noted that beef production has the largest greenhouse gas footprint of any major food commodity and that animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. According to James, JBS USA's various net-zero pledges for 2030 and 2040 are therefore misleading and ""not feasible"" given the scope of its worldwide beef production operations. ""As families continue to face the daily impacts of the climate crisis, they are willing to spend more of their hard-earned money on products from brands that are better for the environment,"" James said in a statement. ""When companies falsely advertise their commitment to sustainability, they are misleading consumers and endangering our planet."" ""JBS USA’s greenwashing exploits the pocketbooks of everyday Americans and the promise of a healthy planet for future generations,"" she added. ""My office will always ensure that companies do not abuse the environment and the trust of hardworking consumers for profit."" GOP REP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING UN FOR CALLING ON AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT The lawsuit was applauded by state Democrats and national climate advocacy organizations like Earthjustice, Mighty Earth, Friends of the Earth US, Citizens Campaign for the Environment and Stand.earth.  ""JBS repeatedly claims that it will reach net zero by 2040. This claim was found to be misleading and yet JBS continues to assert it,"" said Peter Lehner, an attorney at Earthjustice. ""While it is critical for every company to reduce its climate change impact, JBS would need to implement enormous operational changes to achieve this goal. However, JBS is doing very little and is not taking anywhere close to the steps that would be required."" UN CLIMATE SUMMIT SERVING GOURMET BURGERS, BBQ AS IT CALLS FOR AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT In her announcement and lawsuit, James pointed to several instances in which JBS USA and its executives made pledges to reduce the company's impact on the environment. She also stated the company — which has a market cap of more than $10 billion and whose North American beef business earns tens of billions of dollars annually — has acknowledged consumers are more interested in sustainable products. For example, in March 2021, JBS announced a pledge to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 across global operations and including indirect downstream emissions. The company then began a publicity campaign touting the pledge, running a full-page advertisement one month later in The New York Times stating ""it's possible"" for meat production to be ""part of the climate solution."" Since then, JBS and its subsidiaries have continued to tout the 2040 pledge and other sustainability goals. The company even presented at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai late last year, announcing additional sustainability initiatives and investments. TWO DOZEN REPUBLICANS CALL ON BIDEN TO DISAVOW JOHN KERRY'S REMARKS TARGETING FOOD PRODUCTION ""JBS takes its commitment to a more sustainable future for agriculture very seriously,"" JBS USA spokesperson Nikki Richardson said in an email to Fox News Digital. ""We disagree with the action taken today by the New York Attorney General’s office."" ""JBS will continue to partner with farmers, ranchers and our food system partners around the world to help feed a growing population while using fewer resources and reducing agriculture’s environmental impact,"" she continued. ""Our belief that American agriculture can help sustainably feed the world is undeterred."" James' lawsuit comes as environmental groups and lawmakers worldwide increasingly set their sights on the agriculture industry. The global food system — which includes land-use change, actual agricultural production, packaging and waste management — generates about 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of 34% of total worldwide emissions, according to a 2021 study published in the Nature Food journal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Biden's international climate envoy John Kerry warned last year that decarbonization would be impossible without a concerted effort from the agriculture industry to achieve green goals. ""We can't get to net-zero, we don't get this job done unless agriculture is front and center as part of the solution. So all of us understand here the depths of this mission,"" Kerry said."

In a letter late Wednesday to IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee ranking member John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said the Paris-based group has strayed in recent years from its core mission of ""promoting energy security."" They warned that IEA's actions threaten to harm the group's reputation for impartiality. ""We would argue that in recent years the IEA has been undermining energy security by discouraging sufficient investment in energy supplies,"" Barrasso and McMorris Rodgers wrote in the letter. ""Moreover, its energy modeling no longer provides policymakers with balanced assessments of energy and climate proposals. Instead, it has become an ‘energy transition’ cheerleader."" ""Until recently, the IEA has served as a valuable source of reliable information on the security of oil markets, and has provided a mechanism whereby oil-consuming countries can respond effectively to oil shortages,"" they continued. ""Consequently, the IEA must conduct its energy security mission in an objective manner. We believe the IEA is failing to fulfill these responsibilities."" MASSIVE CHINESE FIRM SUES SMALL MICHIGAN TOWN OVER OPPOSITION TO CONTROVERSIAL EV BATTERY PROJECT Barrasso and McMorris Rodgers noted that the Biden administration cited IEA forecasts, rather than internal studies, when justifying its recent action to pause new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects, a move heavily criticized by many in the U.S. energy industry. Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk, who previously served as a leader at the IEA, confirmed the administration's reliance on IEA forecasts last month, which the two GOP lawmakers characterized as ""deeply troubling."" 130+ HOUSE, SENATE REPUBLICANS JOIN FORCES IN OPPOSITION OF BIDEN'S UPCOMING EV MANDATE ""To defend the indefensible, the Biden administration trots out its ostensible fear that more LNG export capacity may be built than is needed,"" the pair continued in their letter to Birol. ""The basis of that fear is the IEA's unrealistic modeling. Decisions about future LNG export capacity should be left up to market participants and investors, not politicians or bureaucrats."" According to the IEA, it was founded in 1974 amid the global oil crisis to help coordinate the international response to oil supply disruptions. But in recent years, Republicans have criticized it for changing direction by placing a large emphasis on pursuing decarbonization policies and ""building net-zero emissions energy systems to comply with internationally agreed climate goals"" – a quote from the Barrasso-McMorris Rodgers letter.  And in 2021, the IEA published a Net Zero Roadmap report that the GOP pair described as ""long on aspiration, but short on the things that matter most to policymakers.""

House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash.; Science, Space, and Technology Chair Frank Lucas, R-Okla.; and Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., penned a letter to Energy Foundation CEO and President Ji Chou, informing him of their investigation into his organization. The letter comes following a Fox News Digital report that uncovered $3.8 million in donations the Energy Foundation sent to American climate groups. ""China could greatly improve its economic and geopolitical position should renewable energy resource use and electrification increase in the United States. China dominates global renewable energy product supply chains, such as those for batteries, solar panels, and electrolyzers,"" the Republicans wrote to Chou, noting the Director of National Intelligence's findings last year that China's green energy dominance ""could pose a significant risk"" to the West. ""China has already attempted to influence United States policy and opinion regarding China through covert influence and exploit perceived societal divisions,"" McMorris Rodgers, Lucas and Westerman added. ""As such, we are alarmed by attempts of China-affiliated organizations attempting to influence United States energy policy."" BIDEN VETOES BIPARTISAN BILL PROTECTING U.S. EV INDUSTRY FROM CHINA In their letter, they requested a series of documents and contracts related to the Energy Foundation's financial activity. The investigation is part of Republicans' broader efforts examining how environmental groups have been influenced by Chinese entities and have increasingly engaged with the Chinese government on climate change. While the Energy Foundation's financial filings indicate that the group is technically headquartered in San Francisco, a Fox News Digital review determined that the majority of its operations are conducted in China with a staff that boasts extensive ties to the CCP. According to its 2022 financial statement, the group leases two office facilities in China under operating leases that have terms through April 2024. US MILITARY BASE'S GREEN ENERGY PROJECT WITH CCP TIES DISCONNECTED OVER NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS The group, which refers to itself as ""Energy Foundation China,"" was formed in 2020 when it split from the United States Energy Foundation, a larger group that identifies its headquarters at the same San Francisco address listed in the Energy Foundation's tax forms. The Energy Foundation retained the original tax identification information from before that split. Among its apparent connections to the CCP apparatus, Chou himself previously served as the deputy director general of China’s National Center for Climate Change Strategy, an agency within the Chinese government’s National Development and Reform Commission.  In addition, Liu Xin, who heads the group's environmental management division, previously served in a high-ranking role at the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau. And Ping He, the program director of the group's industry program, worked for eight years at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a leading state-run research institution.

DARK MONEY GROUP PUSHING GAS STOVE CRACKDOWN HAS SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL STAKE IN GREEN ENERGY ""The Energy Foundation's ties to China are both extremely disturbing and reprehensible,"" Tom Pyle, the president of the Institute for Energy Research, told Fox News Digital in an interview last month. ""These environmental organizations, the recipients of this money, are, in essence, sacrificing our national security and empowering China."" ""We are the richest energy nation in the world with respect to coal, oil and natural gas,"" he said. ""And yet the Biden administration and the environmentalists fueled by China are promoting policies that would increase our dependence on China, which controls all the minerals and materials needed for batteries and wind and solar, and curtail our production of oil and gas here at home."" Among its more than a dozen grants in the U.S. last year, the Energy Foundation wired $900,000 to the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado-based think tank that has engaged the White House on climate policy and advocates phasing down fossil fuel reliance and net-zero policies. The group also funded a study in 2022 highlighting the dangers of natural gas-powered stovetops, which ultimately led to calls for bans on the appliance. The Energy Foundation sent another $480,000 to the Washington, D.C.-based International Council on Clean Transportation, which advocates for widespread EV adoption and policies decarbonizing the transportation sector broadly. It also wired grants – one to the University of Maryland and another to the Jackson Hole Center for Global Affairs – worth a total of $450,000 and earmarked for projects to phase out coal power reliance.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-probing-banks-climate-coordination-impacting-farmers,Republicans probing banks over climate coordination impacting farmers,02-21-2024,FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans are investigating some of the largest U.S. banks over their coordination on climate policy impacting the agriculture sector.,"FIRST ON FOX: A group of 10 House Republicans is probing some of the nation's largest banks over their involvement in an international alliance that seeks to pursue a green transition that may greatly impact the agriculture sector. The Republican lawmakers, led by Rep. Mary Miller of Illinois, penned a letter on Wednesday morning to top executives of Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo, warning about their membership in the so-called Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). They said the NZBA's coordinated actions could be particularly detrimental to American farmers. ""At a time when global demand for food is rising and wars continue to affect the global supply of food and agriculture inputs, we cannot sacrifice our nation’s food security to the demands of the far-left climate agenda,"" they wrote to the banks. ""We urge you to trust American farmers to do what is best for their land to produce the food, fuel, and fiber on which our country and world rely."" ""Our nation’s farmers should not be subjected to the political demands of an unelected international organization,"" they added. ""Since the 1940s, American farmers, ranchers, and foresters have increased agriculture outputs nearly threefold with little to no change in inputs; this is a significant achievement in on-farm productivity and efficiency. We should focus on policies that foster the continued responsible growth of the American agriculture industry, not policies that will shutter it."" 'COSTLY’ ESG STANDARDS, CLIMATE POLICIES WILL ULTIMATELY REDUCE FOOD AND ENERGY SUPPLIES: REPORT Miller and the other Republicans also stated their support for a letter 12 GOP state agriculture commissioners sent late last month to the six banks, similarly expressing concern about their NZBA involvement. The state officials, led by Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper, said American farmers ""should not be forced to put our food supply at risk."" According to that letter, the banks' net-zero commitments made under the NZBA's framework may have severe consequences for farmers, such as cutting beef and livestock consumption, forcing a switch to ""inefficient electric farm equipment,"" and moving away from the nitrogen fertilizer ""necessary for American agriculture to thrive."" Overall, NZBA's actions could increase costs and decrease food production, the letter said. REPUBLICANS UNVEIL EFFORT BARRING CHINA, RUSSIA FROM BUYING US LAND ""Net zero banking is just another attempt for the far left to push their green bad deal on the American people,"" Miller told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""ESG policies will only hurt us and jeopardize our food security."" According to the United Nations, which organized the formation of the NZBA, the alliance is a global group of financial institutions ""committed to financing ambitious climate action"" to transition the economy to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The NZBA's framework encourages its member banks to additionally ""design, set, and achieve"" science-based, net-zero targets for 2030 or sooner. WHITE HOUSE INTERVENED TO GRANT 'QUASI-REGULATORY AUTHORITY' TO FOREIGN GREEN GROUPS The alliance issued a progress report during the most recent U.N. climate summit in Dubai, highlighting how two-thirds of its growing membership pool had made aggressive green energy commitments. The report further noted that member banks are increasingly targeting the power sector; the fossil fuel industry; iron, steel and cement manufacturing; and real estate. The Republicans' letter, meanwhile, comes a week after JPMorgan Chase, State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock exited or scaled down involvement in the Climate Action 100+ investor group, another U.N.-organized alliance of banks seeking to fight climate change.

BIDEN ADMIN FAILING TO TRACK CHINESE OWNERSHIP OF US FARMLAND: GOVT WATCHDOG ""As if that weren’t bad enough, as proposed, there are no limits placed on who can buy these lands. China, Russia, Iran and other bad actors would be free to participate and shut down U.S. energy, mineral and food production.  The Protect America’s Lands Act — introduced by representatives Mark Green, R-Tenn., and Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., in the House and Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., in the Senate — would block the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from allowing so-called natural asset companies (NACs) to list their assets on the New York Stock Exchange. The prospect of these companies being listed has faced opposition from GOP lawmakers, state officials and consumer advocates. UNITED NATIONS FOUNDATION IS QUIETLY FUELING CLIMATE POLICY, FUNDING STAFF IN DEM STATES ""It should be no surprise that the radical left once again tried to force its woke Green New Deal agenda on Americans,"" Green told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""Allowing natural asset companies on the New York Stock Exchange would have opened our country to a world of risk, allowing our adversaries to block energy and food production. That’s why I introduced the Protect America’s Lands Act."" Hageman added that allowing NACs to be publicly listed ""would change U.S. land access, management, use and ownership as we know it. The legislation comes weeks after the New York Stock Exchange withdrew a proposal submitted with the SEC to allow the listing of NACs, a novel type of company chartered to ""protect, restore and grow the natural assets under their management to foster healthy ecosystems."" ""The bottom line is that we must take back lawmaking authority from the administrative state before even more of our security, freedoms and rights are taken away."" The NYSE states that NACs ""capture the intrinsic and productive value of nature and provide a store of value based on the vital assets that underpin our entire economy and make life on earth possible."" Natural assets that could be grouped into an NAC include forests, wetlands and coral reefs, as well as working lands such as farms, according to the NYSE. The debate over NACs stretches back months to when the NYSE first proposed the rule change with the SEC last year that would have allowed for NACs to be listed on the exchange. NYSE collaborated on the proposal with financial services firm Intrinsic Exchange Group, which first floated the idea of listing NACs as a free market solution to climate change. ""It is hard to overstate the danger that so-called 'natural asset companies' pose to the livelihood of millions of Americans,"" Will Hild, executive director of watchdog group Consumers' Research, previously told Fox News Digital.

On Monday, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, will hand-deliver a letter to Podesta in Houston where they and other public sector leaders, alongside a wide range of industry leaders, are attending the annual CERAWeek energy conference. The letter outlines energy security and foreign policy concerns with the Biden administration's recent climate policy pausing major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects. ""Demand for LNG, obviously, is not going away anytime soon,"" Sullivan said in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""American LNG is one of the cleanest forms of energy available anywhere and leveraging America's energy independence is one of our greatest strengths against authoritarian regimes."" ""This issue of American LNG and the pause the Biden administration announced for no reason – all it is, is clearly driven by far-left radical enviros. It's not based on science, it's not based on anything. It's based on politics and Podesta driving it,"" he continued. ""One of the most important weapons we've been providing our allies in Europe, let alone Asia, to get them off Russian LNG is American LNG."" BIDEN'S MORATORIUM ON NATURAL GAS EXPORTS COULD CRUSH SMALL BUSINESSES, TOP REPUBLICAN WARNS The Alaska Republican added that his letter comes after he attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany last month, where a number of European leaders expressed concern about President Biden's LNG moratorium. Noting meetings with the German chancellor, European Union president and NATO secretary-general, Sullivan said the leaders were ""apoplectic"" about the policy. Sullivan, who serves as the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee, was joined in penning the letter by Armed Services Committee ranking member Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Foreign Relations Committee ranking member James Risch, R-Idaho, and Energy and Natural Resources Committee ranking member John Barrasso, R-Wyo. TIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN'S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM ""At a time when war is ongoing in Ukraine and tensions are rising in the Middle East and Asia, it is particularly important that allied nations can rely on the United States for a reliable, long-term fuel supply,"" they wrote to Podesta. ""The administration’s decision, however, creates serious doubts about the reliability of that fuel supply and will have dire national security and foreign policy implications. It should be reversed immediately."" ""If the Biden administration’s policy remains in effect indefinitely, we run the risk of effectively losing one-third of the current potential of increased LNG export capacity, threatening our allies’ energy security,"" the letter continued. ""U.S. LNG exports provide a diverse and secure source of energy to our allies, and it reduces their dependence for that supply on foreign adversaries and potentially unstable regions."" In a surprise move in January, Biden ordered the Department of Energy to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects' carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The action represents a major victory for activists who have loudly called for such a move, which they said would help combat global warming. MORE THAN 150 REPUBLICANS TAKE AIM AT BIDEN'S MORATORIUM ON NATURAL GAS EXPORTS However, the move was blasted by industry groups, former federal officials and bipartisan lawmakers, who noted energy exports are vital for aiding allies in Europe and Asia. In the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago, U.S. LNG largely filled the void left by Russian natural gas as U.S. allies sought to wean off Russian exports and punish the nation's economy, a plan Biden endorsed at the time. Opponents also argued that LNG exports bolster domestic energy production and boost the U.S. economy. Fossil fuel industry groups recently cited research indicating that LNG exports could add as much as $73 billion to the U.S. economy by 2040, create 453,000 American jobs and increase U.S. purchasing power by $30 billion. Critics of Biden's action further said it would not help the environment since global consumers will, as a result, likely revert to greater reliance on coal or Russian gas, both of which are dirtier than U.S. LNG. ""It’s imperative that the U.S. sends a strong message to its allies that it can be a reliable LNG exporter,"" the Republicans' letter Monday concluded. ""The administration’s decision does the opposite, as it will cede America’s influence in these markets, allowing countries like Russia, Qatar, and even Iran to fill the void and give them an unnecessary geopolitical advantage. Therefore, we urge the Administration to reverse its decision and move forward with supporting domestic jobs and our allies abroad.""

Governing for Impact (GFI), founded in 2019 to help craft and guide implementation of federal regulations, quietly issued a memo late last month alongside the left-leaning Center for Progressive Reform (CPR) calling for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revive the 1972 Noise Control Act. The memo argues that cracking down on loud equipment has ""strategic ancillary benefits,"" such as reducing carbon emissions.  However, the Noise Control Act, a law that regulates ""noise emissions,"" has effectively been dormant since Congress defunded the EPA's Office of Noise Abatement and Control (ONAC) in the early 1980s. The memo calls for the ONAC to be revived via existing or newly appropriated EPA funding to enforce the 1972 law and prohibit the sale of gas-powered equipment and vehicles. ""There’s no need to wait for Congress to act — because it already has,"" Will Dobbs-Allsopp, GFI's director of strategic initiatives and one of the memo's co-authors, said after the memo was published, adding that the Noise Control Act could help address an ""environmental injustice"" that hits low-income and minority communities particularly hard. TED CRUZ PROBES LEFT-WING GROUP OVER EFFORT TRAINING FEDERAL JUDGES FOR CLIMATE CASES According to the memo, the Noise Control Act empowers the EPA to prohibit the sale of new commercial products that do not meet best-in-class noise reduction technology. As a result, a revitalized ONAC could prioritize regulatory actions targeting portable air compressors, gas-powered lawn equipment and diesel buses and trucks. It added that prioritizing such regulations would likely also yield ""impressive carbon emissions reductions given advances in electrification technologies."" GFI and CPR noted that electric battery-powered alternatives to traditional gas-powered equipment and vehicles are generally quieter. CONSUMER GROUP REVEALS LEFT-WING GROUPS INCREASINGLY USING COURTS TO PUSH GREEN NEW DEAL ""In the era of climate crisis, the [Noise Control Act] offers a powerful suite of regulatory authorities to help decarbonize certain difficult-to-abate sectors,"" the memo states. ""The NCA empowers (and sometimes obliges) the EPA to prohibit the sale of new products that cannot meet noise emission standards, established by taking into account the 'best available technology.' ""Today, the most cost-effective quiet technologies are often electrified alternatives to products traditionally run on loud, internal combustion engines, which of course also emit carbon dioxide and other dangerous pollutants."" In an interview, James Goodwin, a senior policy analyst with CPR and another co-author on the memo, emphasized that the memo calls for EPA to leverage its existing authority granted by Congress. He added that the climate benefits of such a regulatory regime would be the ""cherry on top."" ""Of course, they're not going to set out and say, 'We're going to regulate leaf blowers because we want this as climate policy.' That's not what their statutory authority says. Nobody is asking EPA to do something it doesn't have legal authority to do,"" Goodwin told Fox News Digital. TOP REPUBLICANS LAUNCH PROBE INTO LEONARDO DICAPRIO-FUNDED BLUE STATE LAWSUITS AGAINST BIG OIL He added that if the EPA, through the revitalized ONAC, enacts noise regulations, a manufacturer could theoretically make a very efficient and quiet piece of equipment that is still powered by gas. However, he said, due to the costs of such technology, manufacturers would likely make electric equipment. ""At the end of the day, manufacturers are going to say, 'No, we're just going to electrify this. It's a lot cheaper and easier for everyone,'"" Goodwin continued. ""That's basically how that would play out."" The memo comes as the Biden administration and Democrat-led state governments nationwide continue to target gas-powered appliances and cars as part of their broader climate agenda. In 2023 alone, the Biden administration issued dozens of regulations taking aim at stoves, water heaters, furnaces and dozens of other home appliances in an effort to reduce emissions. And state and local governments have recently started targeting gas-powered lawn equipment, using arguments similar to those outlined by the GFI-CPR memo.  For example, Colorado state environmental regulators recently banned such equipment on state-owned property and opened the door to a broader ban. The regulation was influenced by the left-leaning Colorado Public Interest Research Group, which said Coloradans no longer have to worry about ""obnoxious noise from gas-powered lawn mowers and leaf blowers when they head to public parks."" MEET THE LITTLE-KNOWN GROUP FUNDED BY LEFT-WING DARK MONEY THAT IS SHAPING FEDERAL CLIMATE POLICY ""It's amazing how the D.C. elite crowd, their solution to seemingly every problem is to fight climate change or carbon emissions and then immediately pivot to banning products or limiting what people can buy, period,"" O.H. Skinner, executive director of the Alliance For Consumers, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""These are people who seem dead set on just trying to wipe away stuff that everyday people use in countless ways, in countless places. ""These are things everyday people use all the time or rely on in extreme scenarios,"" he continued. ""And yet, just like stoves and just like refrigerators — just like damn near everything else people need or use to make their everyday lives possible — you have another dark money group trying to impose their progressive worldview by wiping these things off the shelves, all of which just makes people's lives harder."" Fox News Digital previously obtained internal GFI documents highlighting how the Biden administration has implemented more than 20 of its regulatory agenda items. The group, which prior to that report was invisible to online search engines, has produced legal policy memos for at least ten federal agencies and pitched multiple federal officials on its efforts as part of its ""listening tour"" in 2021. GFI, though, is a project of the New Venture Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit incubator that acts as a so-called fiscal sponsor to groups by providing its tax status. The arrangement allows GFI and other nonprofits it sponsors to avoid filing tax documents to the IRS. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While the arrangement shields the identities of GFI's donors from public view, separate filings show Soros' network of nonprofits has dished out more than $17 million to the group since it was established in 2019. ""We applaud Governing for Impact's efforts to protect everyday Americans,"" an Open Society Foundations spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""We have supported different streams of their work in the past, and you can find it all publicly on our website."" The EPA and GFI didn't respond to requests for comment."

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is probing an environmental group over its ties to the Biden administration and efforts to influence federal judges.","FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is probing the Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Law Institute (ELI) over its efforts to provide first-of-its-kind, climate-related education to federal judges nationwide. Cruz on Friday sent a letter to ELI President Jordan Diamond, demanding information about the group's Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) and its work with former senior Biden administration official Ann Carlson. In the letter, he noted Carlson's involvement in the development of the CJP and that the group shares funding streams with a law firm pursuing high-profile climate litigation on behalf of states and cities nationwide. ""Although ELI claims that it gives ‘neutral, objective information to the judiciary about the science of climate change,’ [CJP] is meant to be a direct complement to the wave of climate change litigation initiated by the Carlson-connected law firm Sher Edling,"" wrote Cruz, who serves as ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee. ""Indeed, ELI knows the impact this litigation could have on the fossil fuel industry."" ""The Project’s funding and ties to plaintiffs in climate change cases further belie ELI’s claim of neutrality,"" he continued. TOP REPUBLICANS LAUNCH PROBE INTO LEONARDO DICAPRIO-FUNDED BLUE STATE LAWSUITS AGAINST BIG OIL While Carlson — who served in the Biden administration between early 2021 and January, crafting regulations targeting gas-powered cars at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — served on the group's board of advisers, ELI established the CJP in 2018 to give ""neutral, objective information"" about climate change litigation and creating a curriculum specifically designed for federal judges, according to their website. Overall, since it was founded more than five years ago, the project has crafted 13 curriculum modules and hosted 42 events, while more than 1,700 judges have participated in its activities, Fox News Digital previously reported. And multiple judges serve as advisers at CJP, potentially having an impact on its curriculum and modules. CONSUMER GROUP REVEALS LEFT-WING GROUPS INCREASINGLY USING COURTS TO PUSH GREEN NEW DEAL For example, Ronald Robie, an associate justice for the Third District of the California Courts of Appeal; Judge Michael Simon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon; and David Tatel, the recently retired former senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, have all acted as advisers for the project. A review of an ELI policy brief summarizing past events indicates CJP has reached judges from across the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th federal circuits, some of which are based in New York City, Boston and Puerto Rico. The group further boasts that it hosted a plenary session with approximately 100 judges in attendance at the annual mid-winter meeting of the Ninth Federal Circuit in 2019. BILLIONAIRE-FUELED ROCKEFELLER FUND COORDINATED CLIMATE LAWSUITS WITH DEM STATE AG: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS ""More specifically, ELI states that ‘climate change litigation’ can ‘control, order, or influence the behavior of others in relation to climate governance,’"" Cruz's letter stated. ""Therefore, the ‘highest goal’ of ELI’s Project is ‘to help the judiciary as [it] build[s] a body of law that appropriately addresses climate change' through climate change litigation. In other words, ELI intends to accomplish via the courts what it cannot get enacted into law: a radical environmental agenda."" ""While ELI claims the Project is ‘neutral’ and ‘objective,’ the Curriculum reads like a playbook for judges to find in favor of plaintiffs in artificial climate change cases against traditional energy companies,"" Cruz continued. The Texas Republican further noted CJP courses ""show how climate science is built on long-established scientific disciplines"" and ""explore the human-caused component of [global] warming,"" such as the ""causal connections between emissions"" and ""changes in the climate."" BIDEN OFFICIAL DOGGED BY ETHICS PROBE FACES KEY SENATE VOTE OVER TAXPAYER-FUNDED SALARY: 'SERIOUS SCANDAL' He also highlighted how CJP and Sher Edling — the California-based law firm pursuing climate litigation against major oil companies on behalf of states and cities including Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Minnesota, New York City, San Francisco, Baltimore, Chicago and Washington, D.C. — have had some crossover in personnel. While serving on ELI's board of directors, Carlson also provided pro bono consulting for Sher Edling on litigation against oil companies, financial disclosures showed. Sher Edling counsel Michael Burger has also participated in multiple ELI events, and former Sher Edling lawyer Meredith Wilensky was previously an ELI Public Interest Law Fellow. And Sher Edling has received funding from left-wing groups like the MacArthur Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which have both funded ELI.

In a letter sent Friday to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Comer revealed that his committee obtained emails between Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry's office and environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) showing extensive communication about plans to oppose coal power. Officials specifically discussed joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), a group the U.S. formally joined in December. ""To meet our goal of 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, we need to phase out unabated coal, and we urge the world to join us in doing so, while working to grow good-paying clean energy jobs,"" Kerry said in a statement on Dec. 2 from the COP28 United Nations climate summit in Dubai. ""Together with the Powering Past Coal Alliance, we will be working to accelerate unabated coal phase-out across the world, building stronger economies and more resilient communities,"" he added. ""The first step is to stop making the problem worse: stop building new unabated coal power plants."" EXPERTS RAISE ALARM AFTER BIDEN STRIKES AGREEMENT WITH CHINA TO SHUT DOWN FOSSIL FUELS Comer expressed concerns in his letter Friday that Kerry's ultimate decision to join the PPCA was heavily influenced by nongovernmental organizations that may, in turn, be coordinating with foreign actors. Notably, the NRDC has significant operations and investment in China, which the group says is aimed at assisting efforts to decarbonize the nation's economy. Comer also noted that coal-fired power plants continue to generate a large share of the nation's total electricity. In 2022, coal accounted for 20% of total U.S. electricity generation, second only to natural gas, according to the Energy Information Administration. CHINESE TECH COMPANIES ARE EXPLOITING US GREEN ENERGY GOALS, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS WARN ""Documents produced to the Committee reveal that the State Department sought and received feedback from leftist environmental groups on the [PPCA] and enabled those groups to influence U.S. foreign policy,"" Comer wrote to Blinken. ""These documents raise significant concerns that confidential information related to U.S. foreign policy, energy policy, and national security policy, have been shared with these groups, including in off-the-record meetings with Envoy John Kerry."" ""The PPCA announcement was the latest example of Envoy Kerry and the Biden Administration taking actions under the guise of climate advocacy that undermine our economic health and threaten foreign policy priorities while avoiding congressional scrutiny,"" he continued. For example, Comer pointed to a March 2021 exchange in which State Department officials ""solicited and received guidance"" from the NRDC about the PPCA. One official wrote to NRDC leaders referencing an off-the-record briefing held earlier that morning and requesting more information about global efforts to phase out coal production. In response, NRDC international analyst Han Chen connected the State Department with another eco group, E3G, and lauded the PPCA for its work driving countries to ""announce earlier coal plant closures through the process of qualifying to join the PPCA."" DEM, GOP REPS RAISE ALARM THAT BIDEN ADMIN LOOKING OTHER WAY ON SOLAR INDUSTRY'S ALLEGED FORCED LABOR TIES One month later, in April 2021, the NRDC, E3G, Sierra Club, Solutions for Our Climate and World Resources Institute authored a memo emailed to State Department officials highlighting their support for the U.S. to join the PPCA. They said joining the alliance would support President Biden's goal to decarbonize the U.S. power grid by 2035. ""These exchanges raise concerns as to what information Envoy Kerry and the SPEC office are providing to organizations like the NRDC in exchange for this information,"" Comer's letter to Blinken continued. ""The Committee is concerned that U.S. government officials providing similar nonpublic information to such groups could enable them to provide it to foreign governments for efforts undermining U.S. national and energy security,"" he wrote. Comer then requested a series of documents and communications related to the State Department's decision to join the PPCA. He asked for the information to be submitted to his committee by Jan. 19 and further requested a staff-level briefing on the topic. The State Department, NRDC and PPCA didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. CCP-TIED GROUP IS QUIETLY FUELING US-BASED CLIMATE INITIATIVES: TAX FILINGS In one of his first actions leading the Oversight Committee, Comer opened a probe in February into Kerry's office over its negotiations with China. And in May, Comer again promised ""intense scrutiny"" of Kerry's China climate talks. The probe announced Friday is part of Comer's broader oversight into Kerry's office and actions representing the U.S. in climate negotiations on the world stage. Shortly after taking office in 2021, Biden appointed Kerry to be the U.S. SPEC, a position that hadn't previously existed, didn't require Senate approval and gave him a spot on the president's cabinet and National Security Council. The SPEC office is housed at the State Department and has an estimated $13.9 million annual budget with approval for 45 personnel.

Overall, the RSC budget endorses dozens of bills that would help achieve its energy production and regulatory goals.  BIDEN ADMIN FUNNELS $1 BILLION FOR CLIMATE PROGRAMS AT BORDERS AMID ONGOING MIGRANT CRISIS For example, it includes the American Energy First Act, put forth by Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., which would reform the onshore and offshore energy leasing and permitting processes to reduce delays. It also endorses the Energy Permitting Certainty Act and Utah Republican Rep. Blake Moore’s Promoting Energy Independence and Transparency Act, both of which streamline energy project permitting. Other bills included in the budget would restore the Keystone XL pipeline's permits, support continued operation of the Line 5 pipeline in Michigan, block the creation of the carbon tax and allow states to develop on federal lands within their borders. ""President Biden's energy policies represent a direct assault on America's energy independence, crippling our economy, inflating energy costs, and undermining the livelihoods of hardworking American families,"" Rep.

""This radical policy is anti-jobs, anti-consumer and anti-American."" VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS UPHOLD STATE'S EV MANDATE DESPITE GROWING OPPOSITION: 'DEFY COMMON SENSE' In a statement to Fox News Digital, the Trump campaign said the climate regulations — unveiled by the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday — would force Americans to buy expensive electric vehicles (EV) and reduce consumer choice. The campaign further vowed that Trump would immediately strike down the regulations if he bests President Biden in their election rematch later this year. ""It will destroy the livelihoods of countless U.S. autoworkers while sending the U.S. auto industry to China. President Trump will reverse Joe Biden's extreme electric vehicle mandate on Day One."" In one ""low cost"" model EPA outlined in the rule, administration officials said automakers would be forced to ensure 56% of light-duty car sales are battery electric and another 13% are hybrid by 2032, meaning nearly 70% of new cars would be zero-emissions or low-emissions by then. The statement comes months after Trump took aim at the Biden administration's climate agenda over its impact on blue-collar rank-and-file autoworkers. During the United Auto Workers strike last year, the former president said the best interests of American workers were his ""number one concern,"" and that a forced EV transition would destroy the U.S. auto industry. Meanwhile, under the regulations unveiled Wednesday, the federal government will enforce the most stringent tailpipe emissions restrictions ever finalized beginning with model year 2027 light-duty and medium-duty vehicles. Those regulations are slated to progressively ramp up through 2032, forcing most new car purchases to be battery electric and plug-in hybrid within that time frame. ""Three years ago, I set an ambitious target: that half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 would be zero-emission,"" Biden said in a statement after the regulations were posted Wednesday.  The EPA regulations, though, were immediately blasted by the energy industry, farm groups, consumer advocates and Republican lawmakers who vowed to pursue legislation aimed at overturning the rules. According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an association that represents major automakers, 9.3% of total car purchases in the U.S. last year were electric or plug-in hybrids — up from 7% in 2022. That uptick was driven largely by purchases in California and urban areas where the majority of EV purchases are made.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At the same time, EVs remain far more expensive than traditional, gas-powered cars. Even factoring in generous federal and state subsidies, the average cost of an EV is about $52,500, while the average subcompact car costs $24,000. ""I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,"" he said. ""Together, we’ve made historic progress. Hundreds of new expanded factories across the country.

""It will also result in an increase in emissions by withholding the most effective tool we have to improve the climate,"" he continued. ""It is a grave mistake for President Biden to reverse course and bow to the elite environmental lobby who do not represent the best interests of the American people and our allies overseas."" DOZENS OF SENATE REPUBLICANS WARN BIDEN'S LATEST WAR ON ENERGY EMPOWERS AMERICA'S ENEMIES Perry — who led the Department of Energy (DOE) under the Trump administration between March 2017 and December 2019 — added that, while serving as secretary of energy, he met with dozens of European leaders who were ""hungry to diversify their energy suppliers."" On Friday morning, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects' carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The move represents a major victory for climate activists who have loudly called for such a move, even threatening to hold large protests in Washington, D.C., over the issue. BIDEN ADMIN APPEARS TO FABRICATE PAPER TRAIL IN PURSUIT OF MAJOR CHEMICAL PLANT SHUTDOWN: COURT DOCS In a statement Friday, the president said the pause on LNG permitting was a part of his sweeping climate agenda, saying the action ""sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time."" He also took aim at ""MAGA Republicans"" for willfully denying the ""urgency of the climate crisis."" ""President Biden’s decision to indefinitely pause LNG export permits prioritizes the wishes of radical activists over U.S. energy security and the security of our allies,"" said McMorris Rodgers. ""This is another gift to Putin. Everyday Americans want our energy unleashed to strengthen the economy, safeguard jobs, and keep us secure. That’s what Republicans will continue to fight for."" ""It is outrageous that this administration is asking American taxpayers to spend billions to defeat Russia while knowingly forcing allies to rely on Russian energy, giving Putin an advantage,"" added Johnson. ""This policy change also flies in the face of the commitments made when the White House announced the joint US-EU Task Force less than two years ago to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russia and strengthen energy security."" ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL ON BIDEN ADMIN TO TANK NATURAL GAS PROJECT AMID NATIONWIDE ARCTIC BLAST While it is unclear which proposed projects the action will affect, a senior administration official said at least two have a larger capacity and two have a smaller capacity. Another official added that the pause implemented Friday will only impact projects that have gone through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) lengthy approval process and are ripe for DOE approval. According to federal data updated this week, there are 11 projects that have been green-lit by FERC but are not yet under construction. An additional four projects are pending before FERC and two are in the pre-filing stage. Those six projects wouldn't be impacted by the pause since they are not before DOE yet, but they would be impacted if approved by FERC. ""Stopping the export of American natural gas is a win for our adversaries, like China and Russia, and a direct blow to the environment, American energy workers and communities as well as our allies overseas,"" Westerman said on Friday. ""It’s a policy that is shortsighted political pandering and will do nothing but drive the cost of energy even higher,"" the Natural Resources Committee chair said. ""American natural gas is the cleanest and safest on earth, and bending the knee to foreign producers only serves to jeopardize our national security and punish hardworking American families who are already struggling under the failing policies of this administration."" BIDEN ADMIN ABRUPTLY REVERSES PROPOSAL OPENING PUBLIC LANDS TO FOREIGN OWNERSHIP AFTER GOP OPPOSITION Congressional Western Caucus Chairman Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., said the pause on LNG export terminal permits is ""yet another assault on American energy production that jeopardizes our national security and global energy markets."" ""President Biden’s move to stall LNG exports is only a win for our adversaries and dirty global polluters like China and Russia,"" GOP House Energy Action Team Chair Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, and Republican Study Committee Chairman Kevin Hern, R-Okla., added in a joint statement. ""U.S. LNG helped Europe through a potential energy catastrophe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and we must not underestimate the important role US LNG cargoes played in handicapping Putin’s efforts."" Biden's action comes weeks after European and Asian energy suppliers called for him to expedite LNG exports. They also called for the president to keep his promise to ensure a steady supply of natural gas in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine. HOUSE REPUBLICANS UNVEIL EFFORT TO BLOCK BIDEN ADMIN FROM TEARING DOWN KEY HYDRO DAMS In the weeks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Biden traveled to Europe and struck a deal with the European Union, vowing to send more U.S. LNG to the bloc. At the time, the White House pledged to ""maintain its regulatory environment,"" a statement that appears to have been contravened with Friday's actions. Additionally, a group of 25 Senate Republicans, led by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., penned a letter to Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm warning of the consequences of the administration's actions. ""Limiting U.S. LNG exports does not have any impact on the world’s demand for natural gas,"" the letter stated. ""Instead, countries including Russia and Iran will simply produce more energy that is subject to less stringent environmental regulations. As a result, limiting American LNG exports in the name of stopping climate change could do just the opposite and add to global emissions."" Proponents of increased LNG exports have noted that transitioning the world's economy to more natural gas reliance would also help ensure nations meet decarbonization goals. Without increased LNG, they argue, nations would rely more heavily on coal-fired power generation, which has a much larger carbon footprint when burned than natural gas power generation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to the fossil fuel industry, the U.S. has led the world in carbon emissions reductions thanks in large part to greater reliance on natural gas. Coal produced the largest share of electricity generated in the U.S. for decades until 2015, when natural gas surpassed it. ""Once again, President Biden has caved to far-left extremists, choosing politics over the actual climate science, gutting the American workforce, and putting America’s national security and our allies at risk,"" Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said. ""When America exports clean-burning natural gas, global emissions go down and our allies can get off Russian gas. These are facts."""

According to the summit's online portal, its food offerings include ""juicy beef,"" ""slabs of succulent meat,"" smoked wagyu burgers, Philly cheesesteaks and ""melt-in-your-mouth BBQ"" in addition to African street BBQ, fast casual Mexican fare and an Asian option that has a ""touch of French flair."" The revelation comes as the U.N. faces criticism for preparing a first-of-its-kind report that is expected to be published at the summit and call for lower meat consumption. The U.N.'s Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO) will publish its first-ever global food systems’ road map during an upcoming COP28 session, which is expected to recommend nations that ""over-consume meat"" to limit their consumption as part of a broader effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The U.N. has, for years, called for individuals to ditch animal-based diets, which it says ""have a high impact on our planet."" ""FAO emphasizes the critical need for an innovative plan and a concrete package of solutions to overhaul agrifood systems,"" the organization said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""The Global Roadmap is positioned as a strategic tool to demonstrate that accelerated climate actions can transform agrifood systems, simultaneously addressing food security and nutrition challenges today and in the future without breaching the 1.5 degrees threshold. In this roadmap, FAO is urging for good food for today and tomorrow."" However, despite the recommendations of the upcoming FAO report and the U.N.'s repeated calls for people to transition to plant-based diets, roughly a third of the food vendors at COP28 provide meat options, according to the summit's data. The summit said that figure represented a victory as part of its commitment to deliver ""environmentally sustainable, socially responsible, delicious, and nutritious food and beverage."" In May, Sultan Al Jaber, the president-designate of COP28, said in a letter to activists that the summit would ""ensure the availability of plant-based food options that are affordable, nutritious, and locally and regionally sourced, with clear emissions labeling."" His letter came in response to repeated calls from the Food@COP climate activist group for the summit to cut back on meat options. ""We know that our food systems are intrinsically linked to the fate of our natural world, and so we have made the progressive decision to ensure that we explore how the catering provided across the event can be responsible and climate conscious, helping to echo the emphasis we have placed on the Emirates Declaration,"" Mariam Almheiri, the director of COP28's food system program, said in October.

BIDEN ADMIN UNVEILS LATEST CRACKDOWN ON OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AT UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE ""The hypocrisy of the global elites never ceases to amaze. They’re the same ones who want working people to swear off flying at all while they get to travel to glitzy conferences on private jets to push a radical green agenda,"" Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., a member of the Congressional Beef Caucus, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""As delegates from around the world are preparing to gather in Dubai to identify solutions to the climate change crisis, we call on them to look at solutions holistically. Solutions that seek to reduce meat consumption are misguided and will only lead to limited consumer choice and higher food prices,"" NCBA Vice President of Government Affairs Ethan Lane said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), which represents American beef producers, also criticized the U.N. ahead of the FAO's global food systems’ road map report, pointing to the industry's relatively low carbon footprint. ""COP28 putting meat on the menu just proves that we need beef and all kinds of meat to help feed the world,"" he continued. ""And that’s why I’ll keep fighting the U.N. and the global elites who are trying to kill meat production, which would only shatter the world’s food security and end an age-old way of life for millions of farmers and ranchers around the world."" ""At a time when malnutrition plagues countries across the world, a reduction of high-quality animal protein would disproportionately impact consumers who can ill-afford to pay more and are ultimately at the highest risk of malnutrition,"" Lane added. ""Reducing beef consumption in the U.S. is not a realistic or impactful solution for climate change. America’s beef producers and consumers around the globe deserve real solutions to the climate issue, not artificial barriers to protein consumption that will do nothing to solve the world’s climate issues."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The global food system — which includes land-use change, actual agricultural production, packaging and waste management — generates about 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of 34% of total worldwide emissions, according to a March 2021 study published in the Nature Food journal. FAO data indicates livestock alone is responsible for around 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. And beef cattle in the U.S. are responsible for just 2% of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions and less than 0.5% of the world’s emissions. In the U.S., however, agriculture alone generates about 10% of total greenhouse gas emissions, federal data shows. The American agriculture sector accounts for just 1.4% of global emissions and has implemented a wide range of solutions, making it the nation's lowest-emitting economic sector."

The report – authored by U.N. Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders Michael Forst – stated that government leaders should listen to activists who engage in disruptive actions, rather than punish them for law violations. Forst's report further characterized recent government actions cracking down on climate protests as ""repression,"" and a threat to democracy and human rights. ""The repression that environmental activists who use peaceful civil disobedience are currently facing in Europe is a major threat to democracy and human rights,"" the report states. ""The environmental emergency that we are collectively facing, and that scientists have been documenting for decades, cannot be addressed if those raising the alarm and demanding action are criminalized for it."" ""The only legitimate response to peaceful environmental activism and civil disobedience at this point is that the authorities, the media, and the public realize how essential it is for us all to listen to what environmental defenders have to say,"" it adds. UNITED NATIONS SET TO CALL ON AMERICANS TO REDUCE MEAT CONSUMPTION According to Forst, who was elected the first U.N. special rapporteur on environmental defenders in 2022, under the 1998 Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee, peaceful environmental protests are protected as a ""legitimate exercise of the public’s right to participate in decision-making."" In the report, he outlined how government authorities worldwide are increasingly restricting certain forms of climate protests in a ""stark increase in repression."" DARK MONEY FUND POURED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO ECO ACTIVIST GROUPS BLOCKING HIGHWAYS, DESTROYING FAMOUS ART He noted that eco activists are often compared to terrorists: counterterrorism laws are being used against environmental protesters, police use water cannons and pepper spray to disperse ""peaceful"" climate protests, protesters are arrested, and protesters who blocked traffic have received prison sentences of up to three years. ""In several countries, environmental activism has been labeled as a potential terrorist threat. Legislation is increasingly being used to stifle environmental protest through the introduction of new offenses, harsher sentences, and bans on particular forms of protest,"" Forst states in the report. ""By categorizing environmental activism as a potential terrorist threat, by limiting freedom of expression and by criminalizing certain forms of protests and protesters, these legislative and policy changes contribute to the shrinking of the civic space and seriously threaten the vitality of democratic societies,"" he continues. ""They also provide the legal basis for the repression of environmental defenders by law enforcement."" UN CLIMATE SUMMIT SERVING GOURMET BURGERS, BBQ AS IT CALLS FOR AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT The report highlights specific examples of alleged repression in France, Northern Ireland, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Austria, Netherlands and Finland. ""These trends give rise to the impression that the authorities’ intention is primarily to intimidate people from engaging in protest,"" Forst adds. He then called for nations to address the root causes of the protests by rapidly transitioning from fossil fuels to green energy alternatives. The top U.N. official also calls for the media, lawmakers, courts and law enforcement to tolerate environmental protests. Forst's report comes as left-wing groups like the global Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil in the U.K., Riposte Alimentaire in France, Ultima Generazione in Italy, Restore Wetlands in Sweden, Stopp Oljeletinga in Norway, and Declare Emergency in the U.S. continue to organize civil disobedience protests worldwide. The increasing number of such actions have sparked widespread criticism.

Jared Golden is taking a stance opposing electric vehicle mandates, bucking his party on a central green-energy tenet.","Democratic Maine Rep. Jared Golden, who is running for reelection in a swing district, is taking a strong stance against a proposed electric vehicle (EV) mandate in his state. BIDEN ADMIN SET TO FINALIZE MAJOR GAS CAR CRACKDOWN OVER WARNINGS FROM AUTOMAKERS, ENERGY INDUSTRY Golden's office confirmed to Fox News Digital that he remains opposed to Maine's EV mandate, which was proposed by the state's Board of Environmental Protection earlier this year and is slated for formal adoption on Wednesday. Maine's so-called Advanced Clear Car Program would mimic regulations approved in California mandating that at least 51% of new car purchases in the state be electric by 2028 and 82% be electric by 2032. While the Maine Board of Environmental Protection was originally slated to vote on adopting the Advanced Clear Car Program in late December, a major windstorm caused widespread power outages statewide, forcing state offices to be closed and the agency's vote to be indefinitely delayed.  ""Congressman Golden submitted testimony in February in opposition to the Maine BEP’s proposal to adopt California clean car standards in Maine. Additionally, he submitted testimony to Maine BEP opposing California truck standards,"" a spokesperson for Golden told Fox News Digital in an email. 17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH ""Mainers proudly work to protect the environment of our state,"" he wrote to the agency. ""I, too, support steps to address the threats of climate change and the goal of keeping our pristine vistas along our coast, mountains, and farmlands intact. Zero Emission Vehicles will eventually — and undoubtedly — play a role in those efforts. Forcing manufacturers — via dealerships in Maine — to offer ZEV automobiles is, in my opinion, contrary to those goals.""  ""For those of us who make our homes here, safe, dependable, and — most importantly — affordable transportation is not a luxury but a cold hard necessity,"" the Democrat continued. ""Any efforts to broaden the use of new energy technologies, particularly in the case of transportation for the average citizen, must take these considerations into account ahead of any government actions."" The state received dozens of other letters of opposition, including one from the Maine Automobile Dealers Association, which said the proposal is ""unreasonable, unachievable and would severely restrict the ability of Maine citizens to purchase a vehicle which meets their needs and wants."" The group noted the Advanced Clear Car Program would ultimately mandate an 800% increase in EV purchases in less than three years. After the vote was delayed, Golden remarked that under the EV mandate, such a storm knocking out power would ironically have rendered most new cars ""useless."" He also noted that the state's power grid is unable to sustain such a massive demand increase caused by a rapid uptick in EV ownership and that charging stations are ""few and far between."" ""Congressman Golden has consistently opposed mandates for electric vehicles at the state and national level, and will continue to advocate on behalf of his constituents,"" the spokesperson added. The Board of Environmental Protection ultimately proposed a slightly-modified version of the Advanced Clear Car Program, pushing the start date from 2027 to 2028, and accepted a new round of comments from the public and stakeholders. Golden then filed testimony on Feb. 1, again opposing the EV mandate rules. The Maine Board of Environmental Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Golden has also taken a stance against broader EV efforts, voting in favor of a bill to prohibit the federal government from allowing state mandates limiting gas car sales in September and, in December, in favor of a bill striking down the Biden administration's aggressive tailpipe emissions standards aimed at pushing EV sales.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-intervened-grant-quasi-regulatory-authority-foreign-green-groups,White House intervened to grant 'quasi-regulatory authority' to foreign green groups,01-22-2024,FIRST ON FOX: The White House intervened to select two nonprofits to oversee federal climate disclosure initiatives in an apparent conflict of interest.,"FIRST ON FOX: The White House intervened in the process for selecting which groups would oversee a federal climate reporting initiative, drawing conflict of interest accusations, according to the preliminary findings of a House Republican investigation. In an internal GOP memo circulated Monday morning and shared with Fox News Digital, the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee's oversight subcommittee highlighted how the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) ""inappropriately"" influenced federal acquisition regulations to unfairly benefit environmental activist groups with significant ties to Democrat donors and CEQ staff. According to evidence obtained by the committee, CEQ succesfully lobbied the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council to outsource the Biden administration's climate reporting and disclosure initiative to two U.K. environmental groups: the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). ""This preliminary investigation report has turned up disturbing evidence that calls into question the entire rulemaking process for these disclosure requirements,"" House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Frank Lucas, R-Okla., told Fox News Digital. ""The White House Council on Environmental Quality clearly exerted inappropriate influence during the development of this rule."" TOP HOUSE COMMITTEE PROBES JOHN KERRY'S COORDINATION WITH ECO GROUPS PUSHING COAL POWER SHUTDOWN ""And we’ve turned up evidence of conflicts of interest where CEQ staff were advocating for regulations that would clearly benefit their friends and former employers,"" Lucas continued. ""I have significant concerns about making U.S. contractors disclose their emissions to a private foreign entity that has no accountability to Congress or the American people. The findings in this report make those concerns all the more urgent."" He added that the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee would continue to pursue its investigation until it received ""satisfactory answers"" from the White House. The issue dates back to May 2021 when, just months into his term, President Biden ordered the FAR Council — which is led by the White House Office of Management and Budget and includes members from other agencies — to craft regulations for requiring federal contractors to both publicly disclose greenhouse gas emissions and to set ""science-based reduction targets"" for reducing their carbon footprint. EXPERTS RAISE ALARM AFTER BIDEN STRIKES AGREEMENT WITH CHINA TO SHUT DOWN FOSSIL FUELS Then, in November 2022, the FAR Council published a proposal requiring all federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and contractors with contracts valued at over $50 million to set ""science-based reduction targets."" However, the regulations specifically require all emissions disclosures to be made through CDP and all targets to be validated by SBTi, effectively outsourcing policy to foreign nonprofits. ""The federal government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers,"" House Science, Space, and Technology Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., said during a hearing on the topic in September. ""However, that is exactly the case in this instance."" According to the memo Monday, in December 2021, just months after Biden ordered the FAR Council to develop the regulations, CEQ, OMB and the Office of Climate Policy within the White House crafted a message sent to department heads, imploring the council to ""leverage existing third-party standards and systems,"" specifically naming both CDP and SBTi. TOP REPUBLICANS LAUNCH PROBE INTO LEONARDO DICAPRIO-FUNDED BLUE STATE LAWSUITS AGAINST BIG OIL But, referencing additional documents and communications obtained by the committee, the GOP memo states CEQ went even further despite under-oath testimony from CEQ Chief Sustainability Officer Andrew Mayock stating that his office's role in the selection of CDP and SBTi stopped at its December 2021 message to department heads.  ""Documents obtained by the Committee contradict this narrative by showing that CEQ worked closely with CDP to tailor its message to the FAR Council in order to guarantee its inclusion in the proposed rule,"" the memo states.  ""Emails obtained by the Committee show that a senior CEQ staffer had previously held a senior role at CDP and may have gone to work at CEQ with the intent of funneling money, influence, and regulatory authority to CDP/SBTi,"" it continues. ""The close relationship between CEQ and CDP/SBTi and the Biden Administration was evident from the beginning."" Betty Cremmins, the director for Sustainable Supply Chains at CEQ, ultimately spearheaded the office's work on the FAR Council proposal throughout 2022 and stayed in regular contact with officials at both CDP and SBTi. However, in an apparent conflict of interest, Cremmins previously worked at CDP as the director of its West Coast office. WHITE HOUSE REFUSES TO REVEAL HOW COSTLY POTENTIAL BILLION-DOLLAR CLIMATE PROGRAM COULD BE FOR TAXPAYERS Cremmins appears to have even coordinated CDP's messaging while at CEQ to ensure it aligned with FAR Council priorities. In one email, CDP's general counsel even went as far as telling Cremmins, ""[w]hen I first met you, you said your goal was to make CDP the law – and you did!""  Further evidence shows that, despite its role in crafting the climate disclosure regulations, the FAR Council had little involvement in the process. Instead, according to the memo Monday, CEQ conducted the vast majority of vetting for the rulemaking. ""The Committee’s primary concern is maintaining the integrity of the scientific and rulemaking process,"" the memo concludes. ""The decision to select CDP and SBTi appears to not have been based on either a meritorious process or generally accepted science, but on arbitrary rulemaking."" ""After a nine-month investigation, the evidence presented shows that the decision to include CDP and SBTi in the proposed rule was based on a desire to steer power, influence, and regulatory authority to favored special interest environmental activist groups,"" it states. ""The evidence shows that the FAR Council was minimally involved in the vetting of CDP and SBTi."" ""The proposed regulation lacks a coherent goal, or a method of achieving it. The evidence suggests that it was never about greenhouse gas disclosures, it was always about making 'CDP the law.'""

The actions, which the White House said fulfilled President Biden's promise to ""lead by example"" on tackling climate change, seek to take advantage of the federal government's annual business travel purchasing power of $2.8 billion and status as the nation's largest employer. Overall, government employees on official business took more than 2.8 million flights, made 2.3 million vehicle rentals and took 33,000 rail trips last year. ""These operational changes will accelerate the clean transportation transformation, increase good-paying union jobs and create healthier communities,"" the White House said in a statement Thursday. ""President Biden’s Federal Sustainability Plan aims to reach net-zero emissions from overall Federal operations by 2050, including a 65 percent emissions reduction by 2030,"" it added. ""Through new Federal employee travel guidelines issued today, the Biden-Harris Administration is advancing this goal by directing Federal agencies to prioritize the use of sustainable transportation for official and local travel, both domestically and internationally."" BEIJING-BACKED GREEN ENERGY FIRM IS EXPANDING IN US, POSING SERIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY RISK: REPORT Under the guidance, government employees must rent an EV on official travel when the cost of the EV is less than or equal to the most affordable comparable gas-powered vehicle available. Additionally, employees must opt for EVs when using taxis and ride-share platforms when they are cost-competitive. In addition, employees must only use rail on trips that require less than 250 miles of travel instead of driving or flying. For local travel, employees will be required to use public transportation, a rule that includes travel upon arriving at an offsite location. ""This will save taxpayer money and reduce pollution that jeopardizes people’s health and fuels the climate crisis,"" the White House said. JOE MANCHIN GOES SCORCHED-EARTH ON BIDEN ADMIN OVER EV ACTIONS BOOSTING CHINA As part of the announcement, rental car and ride-share companies issued a series of commitments to help the government achieve its goals. For example, Hertz is pledging to ""substantially increase"" EV rentals for corporate travelers next year, and Uber is expanding its ""green curb at airports"" program that gives riders perks to go green. California's state government also pledged Thursday to issue guidance within the next six months to encourage its employees to opt for EV options when on official travel. Shortly after taking office in 2021, Biden issued the goal of ensuring 50% of total domestic vehicle purchases are electric by 2030, a first-of-its-kind goal cheered by green energy industry groups and climate advocates. Since then, the administration has pursued various regulations that, while not explicitly mandating electric vehicles, would create strong financial incentives for manufacturers to produce more zero-carbon options and for consumers to transition to those options. In April, the EPA proposed the most aggressive federal tailpipe emissions rules on light- and medium-duty emissions ever crafted. If finalized and implemented, 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck purchases, up to 50% of bus and garbage truck purchases, 35% of short-haul freight tractor purchases and 25% of long-haul freight tractor purchases could be electric by 2032, the White House projected. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Months later, in July, the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued its most aggressive fuel economy standards ever, an action critics say would increase consumer costs.
