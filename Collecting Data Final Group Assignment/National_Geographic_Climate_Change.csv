The city of up to 20,000 residents featured a theater and public baths, churches and craft workshops, and innovative water management systems that enabled Elusa’s citizens to cultivate their most famous export: Gaza wine, a prized white vintage that was shipped across the Mediterranean to ports as far as France.

Within two centuries, however, the Byzantine city of Elusa (also known as Haluza) had collapsed, leaving behind ancient buildings picked apart by later generations or simply buried beneath shifting sand dunes.

Maps and visualizations of the resulting changes in the Arctic make it clear that global warming is no hoax.

Scientists are getting a vastly improved picture of what is happening in the Arctic today as sea-ice extent, thickness, and volume are tracked by satellites, ocean buoys, and submarines with upward-looking sonar. The measurements show that the Arctic keeps breaking records for rising temperatures and declining ice cover. The sea-ice extent hit an all time low in 2012—1.27 million square miles less than the average since 1979. And the winter maximum hit its lowest extent ever at the beginning of this year—620,000 square miles less than average.

The report, Groundswell—Preparing for Internal Climate Migration, also shifts the focus from cross-border migration, which has drawn global attention as refugees and migrants flee war, poverty and oppression, to in-country migration, which involves many more millions of people on the move in search of viable places to live. The 143 million represent 2.8 percent of the three regions’ population. Climate change will transform more than 143 million people into “climate migrants” escaping crop failure, water scarcity, and sea-level rise, a new World Bank report concludes.

2 Countries Reveal How Divided the World Is on Climate Change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/151116-paris-climate-un-costa-rica-australia-co2-greenhouse-warming-carbon,11-16-2015,Our planet’s future climate depends on the actions of countries big and small. Some are aggressively cutting greenhouse gases while others lag behind.,"Costa Rica, known for its white-sand beaches and cloud-draped forests, is a meager contributor to global climate change. Its largest provider of electricity, which relies almost entirely on hydropower, can go months without burning any fossil fuels. Yet, despite its miniscule role in warming the climate, this Central American country is among the nations trying hardest to curb greenhouse gases.

An ocean away, Australia is another story. This coal-rich nation spews more CO2 per capita than almost every other country, putting it nearly on par with the United States. But Australia lacks Costa Rica's ambition, and its carbon-cutting goal is less aggressive than the U.S. government’s.

The tale of these two countries half a world apart highlights an often-overlooked reality: Slowing the relentless pace of climate change requires action by more than just the global juggernauts of the United States, China, and India. And as 195 nations and the 28 member-states of the European Union descend on Paris beginning Nov. 30 to try to lock down the first global agreement to curb CO2, some countries are doing much better than others.

2-million-year-old DNA reveals a lost Arctic world,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/2-million-year-old-dna-greenland-disovery-ancient,12-07-2022,The oldest DNA ever analyzed shows that reindeer and mastodons once wandered a nearly unrecognizable Greenland.,"Two million years ago, on the fringe of some of the northernmost land on Earth just 500 miles from the North Pole, the landscape couldn’t have looked more different from today’s polar desert. Instead, a new study finds, it was richly forested—so productive, it was home to a menagerie of reindeer, rodents, and surprisingly even majestic mastodons.

Using ancient fragments of DNA—likely the oldest ever successfully analyzed—scientists have carefully reconstructed an “unprecedented” glimpse into an ancient, forested landscape at the roof of the world, says Mikkel Pedersen, a geographer at the University of Copenhagen and an author of the new analysis, published Wednesday in Nature.

This Arctic landscape has no modern equivalent, the team says; it is neither boreal forest, as is found in modern Scandinavia, nor temperate forest, but instead a unique mix. They found traces of over a hundred different plant species; insects; marine species; and most excitingly, nine vertebrate species whose fossils had never been seen in Greenland, from small rodents to springy rabbit ancestors to a single trace of a mastodon.

RECYCLE RIGHT
Familiarize your family with your city’s recycling requirements.
PHOTOGRAPH BY VIAFILMS / GETTY IMAGES

We get it—recycling can be complicated. Should you recycle plastic drink bottles with the cap on or off? What about a pasta box with the plastic window? Each facility has different technology and systems, so familiarize your family with the city’s recycling requirements. Even better, book a tour of your local recycling center to show kids how it all works. Once they’ve watched tons of cardboard and paper fly up over hundreds of rotating discs, they’ll never look at the recycling bin the same way again.

SHARING IS CARING

Lower your family’s carbon footprint and packaging waste by sharing stuff instead of buying new items. Bring your children to the local library to check out new books and movies, encourage them to swap toys and games with their friends, and talk to other parents in your area about trading kids’ clothes as they age out of certain sizes.

BEST PET
Taking animals from their natural habitats can threaten wild populations.
PHOTOGRAPH BY IVAN KUZMIN /ADOBE STOCK

If you’re considering adopting an exotic pet like a tortoise or parrot, first do some research as a family: It is possible this animal has been taken from the wild? If so, consider a different pet, since taking animals from their natural habitats can threaten wild populations. Once you’ve chosen something, thoroughly research the care the pet needs—especially how long it could live. And if your family can no longer care for the animal, take it to a rescue organization. Pets released into the wild can become an invasive species, harming native wildlife and their ecosystems. Just look what these cute little turtles did!

UNPLUG

Don’t worry—we don’t mean taking a break from your phone. We’re talking about the charger. Chargers that remain plugged in to the wall can suck energy even when the device is turned off, or not plugged in at all. Ask your kids to remind you to unplug chargers when they’re not in use, as well as switching off power strips for TVs and lamps. We bet they’ll remember more than you will!

PRECIOUS PAPER

About 15 billion trees are cut down each year, many to make paper. Conserve the paper in your home by giving your children scrap paper for coloring, upcycling old magazines for crafts, and using an online resource like Catalog Choice to reduce the unsolicited mail your family receives.

DOOR DASH

An open door to an air-conditioned building can let 2.2 tons of carbon dioxide escape over one summer, about as much as a car on a 5,000-mile road trip. As your family visits shops and restaurants, ask to speak to a manager about closing the door if it’s ajar. You’ll be a model for your kids, showing what it looks like to (kindly) stand up for what you believe in.

FRESH FRUIT

Buying seasonal, local food cuts down on the energy needed to grow and transport it.

PHOTOGRAPH BY CHRISTIAN TISDALE / STOCKSY / ADOBE STOCK

Before taking your children to the grocery store, ask them to look up which fruits and vegetables are in season. Even better: Take a family trip to a farmers market so kids can talk to the experts about their food. Seasonal, local food cuts down on the energy needed to grow and transport it, plus the trip might encourage picky eaters to try something new.

APP IT

Can’t get your kids off their phones? Put it to good use by tracking or reporting the litter they spot in an app like Marine Debris Tracker or through your local environmental protection website. Some cities use the data to create new regulations that will combat pollution.

BOTTLE BRINGER

Let your children pick out their own reusable water bottle and decorate it however they’d like. Then bring those water bottles everywhere. It’ll save you some cash, plus keeping track of their bottles will help teach your kids about responsibility.

PLASTIC BUSTERS

Does your favorite local restaurant hand out plastic straws? Or does your downtown ice cream shop use those tiny plastic spoons to give out samples? Empower your kids to request no straws when they order their drink or ask for broken pieces of waffle cones instead of plastic spoons. And if your youngsters are super brave, help them ask the server or manager to change the policy. (Here’s a guide to get them started!)

CLEAN KICKS

Before and after going on a family hike, have everyone clean the bottoms of their shoes, because the mud caked in your sneakers could contain the seeds of invasive plants. It’s especially important to be careful when visiting an island or other vulnerable habitat.

BINOCULAR VIEWS

Pack binoculars on your next family outdoor adventure. They’ll allow your children to observe wildlife without disturbing the animals, which can stress them out. This also encourages kids to stay on the trail so that they don’t damage the ecosystem.

 

KID SCIENTISTS

Instantly transform your kids into scientists by signing up for a citizen science project that tags, tracks, or identifies animals. Just snapping a photo of a butterfly and uploading it to a site like iNaturalist can help biologists learn how these animals are adapting to a changing world.

STAY LEASHED

Keep Fido close at hand on walks.

PHOTOGRAPH BY SANDRA / ADOBE STOCK

If you’re bringing your family dog on a walk, always keep it on the leash. Dogs sometimes hunt or chase wildlife, and they can stress local animals just by running through their habitats.

BACK WHERE YOU FOUND IT

It’s fun to search for slugs under logs and salamanders under rocks, but teach your children to always put these things back. Rocks, leaves, and logs are animals’ homes, and moving them can upset the fragile ecosystem.

PURPOSEFUL TRIP

Plan a full family vacation or just an afternoon jaunt to a wildlife refuge, national or state park, bird sanctuary, or nature preserve. These places are more likely to receive funding to stay open if more people visit them.

ANIMAL AWARENESS

Be suspicious of experiences that promise up-close interactions with wild animals like big cats, elephants, sloths, and monkeys. Often these animals have been snatched from the wild and are suffering in captivity.

SAFE SOUVENIRS

Avoid souvenirs or other items made from animal parts like scales, teeth, feathers, tortoise shells, seashells, coral, and especially ivory. Instead, take your kids to local bazaars where you can meet the artists and search for items made of materials like fabric, aluminum cans, or magazine paper.

HANDY HOTELS

Many hotels offer guests the chance to reuse towels instead of sending them down to be cleaned after each use. Take advantage of this eco-friendly policy and ask your family to hang up their towels after each use. (And maybe they’ll even start doing it at home without being asked!)

The Tambora event was the largest volcanic eruption in the last millennium. On the U.S. Geological Survey’s Volcano Explosivity Index, Tambora scores a seven out of eight. That’s ten times bigger than the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption and a hundred times more powerful than the 1981 Mount St. Helens blast.

On the island, the immediate event killed at least 10,000 people and possibly more than 90,000, largely from exposure to the searing hot, toxic swells of gas and rock that came tumbling down the mountain, known as pyroclastic flows. But Tambora’s effects were felt even farther afield. The eruption injected about 100 megatons of sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere, a gaseous surge that eventually morphed into a global haze.

Two major hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—blasted the U.S. coast with winds exceeding 130 miles per hour (mph), and savage Hurricane Maria rocked Puerto Rico with winds exceeding 155 mph.

Totals are still being calculated, but early tabulations indicate that the U.S. suffered more than $200 billion worth of damage from 17 named storms during the season, which began June 1 and ends Thursday, November 30. That easily eclipses the previous record of about $159 billion, set during the summer of 2005, when Hurricane Katrina inflicted massive devastation on New Orleans.

Warmer waters fuel stronger storms, increasing the damage that hurricanes and tropical storms inflict. The added warmth hurts coral habitats and stresses fisheries.

Reefs are among the most fragile ecosystems on the planet and essential to marine life. They are also highly sensitive to climate change and are dying at a dramatic rate.

By the century’s end, virtually every reef in the ocean will suffer annual life-threatening bleaching events, according to a report published earlier this year in Nature’s Scientific Reports. Australian scientists who surveyed the Great Barrier Reef last month now say the world’s largest coral reef system, which lost about a fourth of its coral last year in its worst-ever bleaching event, faces another bleaching problem this year that could be even worse. A paper published Thursday on the cover of Nature confirmed those fears by documenting hundreds of miles of bleached Australian reef, a consequence of warmer water.

But—and here’s the hope—fake reefs may be less vulnerable to climate change and more durable in the changing ocean chemistry than natural reefs.

The $19-billion request for NASA—which still requires approval by Congress—would largely preserve plans for space exploration in the form of continued funding for a 2020 Mars rover, a flyby of Jupiter’s moon Europa, and the passenger-ferrying vehicles known as the Space Launch System and Orion capsule."

Trump said the 1,900-mile pipeline—which will cross much of the Great Plains in a path from Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico—will be “the first of many infrastructure projects” to stimulate jobs (see a map of the route).

TransCanada, the Calgary-based company behind the pipeline, was issued the construction permit from the State Department the same day.

The pipeline has been a hot-button issue for years, pitting the fossil-fuel industry against many environmentalists, who have said the project will increase the country’s reliance on oil (particularly dirty oil from Canada’s vast tar sands), harm sensitive lands and wildlife along its course, and signal to the world that the U.S. has not yet gotten serious about addressing the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. The country should invest more in renewable alternatives, a coalition of green groups has argued. (Learn about a young writer's five-month journey down the pipeline's proposed route.)

Can drones fight deforestation? Engineers at U.K.-based BioCarbon Engineering have developed seed-depositing drones designed to plant a billion trees a year. More nimble than current aerial methods, the drones can reach places humans can’t.

2. Plastic cleanup
The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch nonprofit, has an idea to clear out the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the sprawling expanse of floating plastic and trash in the North Pacific. Using floating screens and anchors, the system will corral plastic on the water and hold it until it can be collected.

3. Flying above ice

Since the first Earth Day in 1970, the United States and nations around the world have made significant progress in protecting the environment.

However, there is much work to be done, and new challenges have emerged. In this timeline, we examine the progress—and the setbacks—over the past 50 years.

50 YEARS OF PROGRESS

In wealthy countries, the air, water, and land are cleaner than 50 years ago. The task ahead: expand that success, develop clean energy, and conserve as never before.

1970: World population reaches 3.7 billion.

1970: First Earth Day
On April 22, an estimated 20 million people march in U.S. streets to call attention to the urgent need for environmental protections.

1970: “Environmental Magna Carta”
The National Environmental Policy Act takes effect in the U.S. It requires environmental impact assessments for federally permitted projects such as roads and dams.

1972: Cleaning up rivers
The Clean Water Act regulates pollution and leads to major cleanups in U.S. rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and coastal areas. Some even become fishable and swimmable again.

1972: U.S. bans notorious pesticide
Silent Spring had called for it; the new EPA does it: DDT is declared to be dangerous to wildlife, the environment, and potentially humans.

1972: Defending marine mammals
The Marine Mammal Protection Act shields declining populations—whales, dolphins, seals, and manatees—from hunting and harassment in U.S. waters. Their numbers begin a decades-long recovery.

1980: World population reaches 4.5 billion.

1980: Alaska wildlands protected
The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act sets aside more than 100 million acres of wilderness in national parks, preserves, and refuges.

1980: Superfund program launched
The fund enables the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to clean up hazardous waste sites. Polluters must perform the cleanup or pay for it.

1990: Fighting acid rain
Amendments to the U.S. Clean Air Act help reduce acid rain and ozone depletion, require cleaner gasoline, and target toxic emissions and urban air pollution.

1991: Bringing ferrets back
Black-footed ferrets, once extinct in the wild, are reintroduced to the American West by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service scientists after a captive-breeding program. They remain endangered.

500-year-old 'goatelope' mummy found in melting European glacier,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/500-year-old-goatelope-mummy-found-in-melting-european-glacier,08-11-2022,"The small chamois, a kind of goat-antelope, may herald more spectacular finds to come this summer—another Ötzi the Iceman?—as glaciers in the Alps melt at a record-breaking pace.","GEPATSCHFERNER, AUSTRIA — Her feet steady on the glacier, Andrea Fischer pulls the blade of her chainsaw in a circle through the ice, shards flying toward her face. Inside the circle: a mummified chamois, an endearing goat-antelope mix perfectly adapted to the Alps. This one was just a kid—a young female no more than two feet tall.

“We believe that she is about 500 years old,” says Fischer, an Alpine glaciologist from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Mountain Research of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Innsbruck.

The skin has slid off the animal’s head, pulling one horn with it and laying bare her deep eye sockets, but it’s still stretched taut and leathery over vertebrae and her ribcage. Tufts of walnut-colored fur, rippling in the wind, cover her hooved legs—powerful, agile limbs that in life would have launched her from rock to rock. In her last moments, she drew them close. She was probably around two years old.

6 Places Where Melting Snow Means Less Drinking Water,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/151112-river-basins-water-drought-snowpack-snowfall-climate-change-science,11-12-2015,"All basins will likely have less water from snowpack as the planet warms. But some regions will be in worse shape than others, a new report says.","Climate scientists have a pretty good idea what is going to happen to much of the Earth’s snow as the planet warms over the next century: It’s going to melt. But the melting will occur at different rates in different places, which has major implications for the 2 billion people who rely on snowmelt for water.

What’s more, over the next few decades, some areas are likely to see increased snow and rainfall as climate changes in complicated ways.

“Such confounding factors complicate how water managers will be able to respond to climate change,” says Justin Mankin, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s Earth Institute.

6 Reasons Why U.S. Paris Reversal Won't Derail Climate Progress,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/trump-climate-change-paris-agreement-california-emissions,06-01-2017,"Falling prices for renewables and a growing sustainability movement from the bottom up have changed the global picture, despite Thursday's announcement from Donald Trump.","After months of hinting, President Donald Trump finally announced his intention to pull the United States out of a global agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions on Thursday. He said that he would work toward negotiating a new climate deal that would be ""more fair"" to American workers instead, even though the original Paris Agreement was voluntary.

Trump's decision could severely undermine the pace of climate progress, discouraging other countries from meeting their own commitments, limiting the U.S.'s ability to steer discussion, and ceding jobs and the economic windfall of an ongoing energy revolution to countries such as China.

But 18 months after more than 190 countries agreed in Paris to take steps to avoid a two-degree Celsius rise in temperature, it's important to keep in mind that the switch to clean energy is happening already, according to an analysis unveiled earlier this month in Europe. Dramatic change is already taking shape in the three countries that need it most—the U.S., China and India.

6 ways our post-pandemic world will be different,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/how-our-post-pandemic-world-will-be-different-feature,10-13-2020,"When COVID-19 is reined in and humanity enters the new normal, expect transformations in learning, work, communication, and technology.","This story appears in the November 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.

The future has never been easy to forecast, and the coronavirus makes life even more unpredictable. To gather informed perspectives on how we most likely will live, learn, work, and communicate when we reach the new normal, National Geographic interviewed a range of experts and leaders.

New Ways to Learn

One positive aspect of schools closing may be how districts are innovating to improve learning from home. Although equal access to tech remains a barrier, tools will be designed that may bridge divides. K-12 students will use technology to help with homework, set goals, and measure progress. And college students may find campus to be optional, Arizona State University president Michael Crow says. ASU is one of a number of schools evolving into a new “national service university,” ballooning its enrollment to provide high-quality and low-cost education on a larger scale.

Balancing Work, Life

The future of work won’t be fully remote, but it won’t be clustered in offices, either. “It’ll be a hybrid,” says Martine Ferland, CEO of Mercer, a human resources firm. Smaller offices will be hubs for occasional in-person collaboration, while enhanced digital tools—such as better video chatting—will support workers at home. And more emphasis on balancing productivity with personal needs will allow employees to organize their work hours to fit their schedules. Flexibility, Ferland says, will be the ultimate job perk.

Tech Leads the Way

Broadband access has never been equal. The pandemic exposed that divide. Yet advances in high-speed 5G telecom networks will fuel a growth spurt in fields from telemedicine to banking, education, and transportation, offering faster connectivity and greater access. “This will be a tidal wave of change,” says David Grain, CEO of Grain Management, a private equity firm focused on the telecommunications industry. More efficient networks will reduce costs and help small businesses leveled by the pandemic reach new customers and grow.

Remote Possibilities

The internet has made it possible for millions of people to work remotely, but it’s put us at risk from cyberattacks. Jesper Andersen, CEO of cybersecurity firm Infoblox, says that “it’s a lot more complex to secure an all-remote business,” let alone a telehealth office or a network for self-driving cars. Today’s VPNs (virtual private networks) won’t function efficiently with millions working from home long term. Decentralized servers will increase speeds, and more elaborate ways to log in will strengthen online security.

Get Out and Stay Out

U.S. national parks saw dramatic drops in visitors last spring—but then numbers rebounded, as did sales for RVs and bikes. The Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics says that recreationists reported going outdoors more often this year and also shifting from adventure sports requiring travel—skiing, climbing, backpacking—to closer-to-home activities such as bird-watching, gardening, and bike riding. Many cities closed streets to make room for outdoor dining, public events, and parks.

One Planet, Two Crises

(by Robert Kunzig)

Public concern in the United States about global warming hit an all-time high last November, according to researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities. Large majorities of Americans think human-caused global warming is real, and they feel worried and even personally responsible. Surprisingly, a survey in April found that COVID-19 hadn’t displaced concern over the climate—though it had reduced media coverage of it. “The issue seems to have matured, seems to have solidified,” Anthony Leiserowitz of Yale said. “I think that’s a really encouraging sign.” (Follow National Geographic's comprehensive coronavirus coverage.)

"6,000 years of arrows emerge from melting Norwegian ice patch",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/6000-years-arrows-emerge-melting-norway-ice-patch,11-25-2020,The record-setting discovery of 68 projectiles from the Neolithic to the Viking Era also upends ideas on how ice both preserves and destroys archaeological finds.,"Archaeologists in Norway have discovered dozens of arrows—some dating back 6,000 years—melting out of a 60-acre ice patch in the county’s high mountains.

Expeditions to survey the Langfonne ice patch in 2014 and 2016, both particularly warm summers, also revealed copious reindeer bones and antlers, suggesting that hunters used the ice patch over the course of millennia. Their hunting technique stayed the same even as the weapons they used evolved from stone and river shell arrowheads to iron points.

Now the research team is revealing the finds in a paper published today in the journal Holocene. A record-setting total of 68 complete and partial arrows (and five arrowheads) were ultimately discovered by the team on and around the melting ice patch–more than archaeologists have recovered from any other frozen site in the world. Some of the projectiles date to the Neolithic period while the most “recent” finds are from the 14th century A.D.

60 hours on burning Kangaroo Island,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/kangaroo-island-wildfires-dispatch,01-17-2020,Dispatch from Australia: Our reporter describes the ongoing catastrophe of record bushfires on the continent's wildlife.,"3 p.m. (New Zealand time), January 5This is the day of the tangerine sky. It is midsummer, mid-afternoon, and the sky above Auckland, New Zealand, has turned dark orange, as if in an eclipse. Drivers turn on their headlights. Worried residents call the emergency number to ask what’s happening. Smoke from Australia’s bushfires is drifting across the ocean and turning our own sky fiery. We have seen the headlines: “Australia is burning,” “Australia is on fire,” even, “Australia is committing climate suicide.” We have seen the photos: a fire tornado, evacuated townsfolk sheltering on a beach, kangaroos leaping for their lives, flames turning forests incandescent, cockatoos dropping dead out of scorching skies. And now the disaster is above our heads, eerily present though 1,400 miles away. It used to be that the symbol of climate change in the South Pacific was a drowning atoll; now it’s a burning continent.



















On January 9, when this satellite image was
recorded, a third of Kangaroo Island had been burned. Hot weather and unfavorable
winds that day caused the fires to flare up and drive the fire front eastward,
almost to the airport. Nearly half the 1,700-square-mile island has now
suffered fire damage.

Photograph by Lauren Dauphin, NASA Earth Observatory/LandsatMidday, January 9I board a plane to Adelaide, South Australia, and stumble on an inflight movie miniseries about Chernobyl. I watch it obsessively for the next four hours. Its relevance feels uncanny. A nuclear meltdown in preparation for a climate meltdown, each cataclysm surrounded by its own political ecosystem of deception and denial, promulgated, in the words of Chernobyl’s narrator, by “an entire congregation of obedient fools.” Chernobyl was madness. Climate change is madness. When do we reach a tipping point with this? When do we start to become sane? 3 p.m. (New Zealand time), January 5This is the day of the tangerine sky. It is midsummer, mid-afternoon, and the sky above Auckland, New Zealand, has turned dark orange, as if in an eclipse. Drivers turn on their headlights. Worried residents call the emergency number to ask what’s happening. Smoke from Australia’s bushfires is drifting across the ocean and turning our own sky fiery.

Photograph by Lauren Dauphin, NASA Earth Observatory/LandsatMidday, January 9I board a plane to Adelaide, South Australia, and stumble on an inflight movie miniseries about Chernobyl. I watch it obsessively for the next four hours. Its relevance feels uncanny. A nuclear meltdown in preparation for a climate meltdown, each cataclysm surrounded by its own political ecosystem of deception and denial, promulgated, in the words of Chernobyl’s narrator, by “an entire congregation of obedient fools.” Chernobyl was madness. Climate change is madness. When do we reach a tipping point with this? When do we start to become sane?"

75% of Earth's Land Areas Are Degraded,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/ipbes-land-degradation-environmental-damage-report-spd,03-27-2018,A new report warns that environmental damage threatens the well-being of 3.2 billion people. Yet solutions are within reach.,"MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA — More than 75 percent of Earth’s land areas are substantially degraded, undermining the well-being of 3.2 billion people, according to the world’s first comprehensive, evidence-based assessment. These lands that have either become deserts, are polluted, or have been deforested and converted to agricultural production are also the main causes of species extinctions.

If this trend continues, 95 percent of the Earth’s land areas could become degraded by 2050. That would potentially force hundreds of millions of people to migrate, as food production collapses in many places, the report warns. (Learn more about biodiversity under threat.)

“Land degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change are three different faces of the same central challenge: the increasingly dangerous impact of our choices on the health of our natural environment,” said Sir Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which produced the report (launched Monday in Medellin, Colombia).

Last week, nine countries—the U.S., Canada, Russia, Norway, Greenland/Denmark, China, Japan, Iceland, South Korea, and the European Union (which includes 28 member states)—signed a treaty to hold off on commercial fishing in the high seas of the Arctic Ocean for at least 16 years while scientists study the potential impacts on wildlife in the far north. It was an extraordinary act of conservation—the rare case where major governments around the world proceeded with caution before racing into a new frontier to haul up sea life with boats and nets. They set aside 1.1 million square miles of ocean, an area larger than the Mediterranean Sea.

But to really grasp the significance of this milestone, consider why such a step was even possible, and what that says about our world today. For more than 100,000 years the central Arctic Ocean has been so thoroughly covered in ice that the very idea of fishing would have seemed ludicrous.

Speaking from his home in Pelham, New York, the author explains how the Tlingit people of Alaska helped shape Muir’s views on nature; how Alaskans get more hand-outs from the government than residents of any other state, though they love to depict themselves as rugged individualists, and why Alaska remains a magnet for people who want to reinvent themselves.

In the old days, before March 2020, I used to bike to work at National Geographic’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. Taking the bike instead of my car saved me sitting in traffic, which I despise, and paying to park downtown. It saved me running for a bus that came at infrequent and unpredictable intervals. The ride was less than four miles, and on the way in it was mostly downhill, which made the decision to ride each morning a little easier. Plus, all that biking, especially the uphill slog home, allowed me to skip going to the gym and still feel entitled to my wine and chocolate.

And oh yeah, it was better for the planet too.

The pandemic shut down my commute, like that of so many others, but it has inspired millions of people around the world to jump on bikes for the first time in years, Ilana Strauss writes for us this week. Most of that riding was recreational and probably didn’t displace much carbon pollution. But cities around the world are making lasting changes to their streets to encourage biking, in what may prove to be an enduring silver lining of COVID-19.

Fear of being maimed or worse by cars is what keeps many people from commuting by bike, surveys show. European cities don’t kill nearly as many cyclists as American ones; the fatality rate is five to 10 times higher in the U.S. than in countries like Denmark and the Netherlands, urban planners Ralph Buehler and John Pucher reported last year. But in Europe too urban biking used to be much more lethal—and much less common.

“Americans have this image, ‘Oh cycling is just paradise, and it’s always been paradise in Europe,’” Pucher tells Strauss in this week’s episode of Overheard, the National Geographic podcast. “Wrooong. Not true!” After World War II, European cities were overrun by cars too. It’s just that since the 1970s many have made concerted efforts, spearheaded sometimes by concerned citizens, to reclaim their streets for unmotorized people.

American cities are now following that trend, a few decades behind. Minneapolis is a leader, Stephanie Pearson writes for Nat Geo; its 5.5-mile-long Midtown Greenway (pictured above), which follows an old railway corridor, is lit at night and plowed in winter, and it’s often a quicker way across town than driving. In Minneapolis and other cities, however, the key to bikeability isn’t a gorgeous greenway or two. It’s a connected network of bike paths and lanes that make it possible to ride from any point A in the city to any point B, safely and easily.

New York City has added more than 60 miles of paths and lanes during the pandemic, Chicago around 30, Buehler and Pucher reported last spring. Washington hasn’t seen a surge like that, but it has seen a steady expansion of its network. The percentage of commuters traveling by bike in D.C. went from 1 percent in the late 1990s to 5 percent in 2018, Strauss writes.

I noticed the change myself. On some mornings, when I entered the final straightaway to the office, there would be a whole motley peloton of us rolling down 17th Street, fanning out as if we owned the road, as if we were Tour de France riders leading our chase cars down the Champs-Elysées. As we crossed Massachusetts Avenue, some of us would stand up on the pedals, pumping furiously to make the light at Rhode Island. For this aging boomer in cargo shorts and a goofy helmet, that sprint was a little morning jolt of childhood joy. You may think you can’t recapture that in your grown-up workday but think again: It’s just like riding a bike.

A fish that walks on the seafloor has gone extinct.

Other handfish may be next.","For the first time in modern history, a marine fish species has been declared extinct. The smooth handfish (Sympterichthys unipennis), a shallow-water bottom-dweller with spiky fins and a barb-like protrusion on its forehead, has not been seen since 1802, when French biologist François Péron helped scoop one up near the coast of Tasmania to bring back to Paris’s Natural History Museum.

Despite extensive searches over many years, no smooth handfish were ever seen again. In May, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a global consortium of scientists that sets the conservation statuses of species, formally listed it as extinct.

Thirteen other species of handfish—so named because they perch on the seafloor on fins that look like little hands and act like feet—are probably still around, though seven of the species haven’t been seen since 2000 or earlier. All but one species is considered endangered, critically endangered, or “data deficient,” meaning there’s not enough information available to decide their status.

What the repercussions of that approach are isn’t yet clear.,"A swarm of locusts is awe inspiring and terrible. It begins as a dark smudge on the horizon, then a gathering darkness. A rustle becomes a clatter that crescendos as tens of millions of voracious, finger-sized, bright yellow insects descend on the land.

So far, a ground and air spraying campaign over eight East African countries, coordinated by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), has staved off the worst—the very real prospect that the locusts would destroy the food supply for millions of people. Last year, the operation protected enough pastureland and food stocks, by the FAO’s calculations, to feed 28 million people in the Greater Horn of Africa and Yemen for an entire year.

The scale of the locust outbreak, which now affects seven East African countries, is like nothing in recent memory.

The insects behind the mayhem are desert locusts, which, despite their name, thrive following periods of heavy rainfall that trigger blooms of vegetation across their normally arid habitats in Africa and the Middle East. Experts say a prolonged bout of exceptionally wet weather, including several rare cyclones that struck eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula over the last 18 months, are the primary culprit.

City-sized swarms of the dreaded pests are wreaking havoc as they descend on crops and pasturelands, devouring everything in a matter of hours. The scale of the locust outbreak, which now affects seven East African countries, is like nothing in recent memory.

The insects behind the mayhem are desert locusts, which, despite their name, thrive following periods of heavy rainfall that trigger blooms of vegetation across their normally arid habitats in Africa and the Middle East. Experts say a prolonged bout of exceptionally wet weather, including several rare cyclones that struck eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula over the last 18 months, are the primary culprit.

Offshore drilling safety rules rolled back
May 2, 2019

The Trump administration announced that they will roll back some safety measures that regulate offshore drilling operations.

The previous set of safety rules were implemented in 2010, after a disastrous explosion at a BP oil well in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 people and spilled over 200 million gallons of oil into the sea. Oil from the disaster marred the nearby coasts and deep seas for years afterward.

After the explosion, the Obama administration tightened safety rules for offshore drilling operations. Amongst other measures, they required more tests on “blowout preventers” and other parts of the drilling apparatuses and required safety checks from independent investigators. The new rollbacks reduce or rescind these safety measures.

The rollbacks were welcomed by leaders in the oil and gas industry and criticized by many environmental groups.

Bernhardt confirmed as interior secretary
April 11, 2019

The U.S. Senate confirmed David Bernhardt as secretary of the interior on a 56-41 vote. It's a post he has held on an acting basis since previous office holder Ryan Zinke resigned earlier in the year amid allegations of ethics misconduct.

Democrats had criticized Bernhardt's nomination in part because of his long history as a lobbyist for the energy and agribusiness sectors. Environmentalists have expressed concern that he will continue working to expand extraction operations on public lands and roll back protections. Democrats have called for an investigation of Bernhardt's pass conduct.

“David Bernhardt spent years in the private sector advancing policy goals of special interests who profit off our public lands. Despite his clear conflicts, Zinke put him in charge of ripping apart the plans just to help those very industries that Bernhardt used to work for,” Jayson O’Neill, deputy director of the Western Values Project, a Montana-based nonprofit focused on public lands protections, said in a previous statement.

Trump signs pipeline orders
April 9, 2019

President Trump signed two executive orders that will smooth the path for companies to build oil and gas pipelines and limit the tools states have to block them.

The Trump administration, as part of their ""Energy Dominance"" initiative, has consistently sought to streamline the domestic energy production process. These two executive orders follow in that pattern.

The first order directs the EPA to reconsider a part of the Clean Water Act. ""Section 401"" of the Act requires any oil or gas project that could potentially contaminate waters regulated under the act to receive state-level certifications and approvals. In the past, states have occasionally denied those certifications, preventing pipelines and other infrastructure from being built. If the EPA re-evaluates this section of the act, companies would be able to sidestep the state certification process, streamlining the pathway to construction.

The second order asserts that the president has the authority to “issue, deny, or amend” any permits for pipelines or other infrastructure projects that cross international borders. Previously, that authority lay with the secretary of state. Most notably, this decision would apply to permitting decisions concerning TransCanada Corporation's controversial Keystone XL pipeline, a project that, if completed, could carry some 800,000 barrels of oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast each day.


Trump Greenlights Keystone XL Pipeline
March 29, 2019

President Donald Trump issued a new permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, which he had previously approved two years ago, after the Obama administration had delayed it. The pipeline would carry crude oil from the tar sands of western Canada to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Trump's previous approval had been blocked by a federal judge in Montana in November, who had said the government had not done enough to complete environmental reviews of the controversial project.

In response to the new order, a White House spokesperson told the Associated Press, “Specifically, this permit reinforces, as should have been clear all along, that the presidential permit is indeed an exercise of presidential authority that is not subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.”

Stephan Volker, a lawyer representing environmentalists opposed to the pipeline, told the AP he would be suing to block construction. “President Trump has launched a direct assault on our system of governance,” Volker said.

Oil and gas companies get access to sage grouse habitat
March 15, 2019

The sage grouse, an odd-looking western bird that has become a symbol of land conflict between environmentalists and energy companies, is again at risk of losing some of its habitat.

On Friday, the Trump administration announced it would be dismantling the 2015 Sage Grouse Conservation Plans, which had been negotiated by many stakeholders from industry to conservation groups. The new directive, led by acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, now gives states more control over which habitats they can open for fossil fuel extraction. Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, and parts of California will be impacted, and the National Wildlife Federation cites eight million acres of sage grouse territory that will be potentially at risk.

Those in favor of the change are saying it will give states more flexibility over their own territories and was praised by Utah Governor Gary Herbert.

Conservationists fear the regulatory rollback will push the species toward endangerment. Once numbering as many as 16 million, only about 500,000 are thought to exist today. The National Wildlife Federation classifies the bird as an indicator species, meaning when sage grouse populations are declining, the surrounding ecosystem is likely declining.


Trump signs bill protecting millions of acres of public lands
March 12, 2019

President Donald Trump signed a bill that provides protections to over two million acres of lands across the United States. The massive package was well-received by environmental groups, hunting and angling groups, and lawmakers from both parties; before Trump signed, it had easily passed in both the House and the Senate.

The package touches nearly every state, designating 1.3 million new acres of wilderness lands across several western states; creating new national monuments in Mississippi and Kentucky; and protecting hundreds of miles of rivers under the Wild and Scenic Rivers program. In addition, the bill guarantees authorization for the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund, a program that uses revenues from offshore oil and gas drilling to fund public lands and conservation efforts nationwide.

Andrew Wheeler confirmed as EPA administrator
February 28, 2019

Since Andrew Wheeler was made acting EPA director in July, he has issued a series of controversial environmental rollbacks. Wheeler is a former coal lobbyist who replaced Scott Pruitt, President Trump's first pick for EPA administrator who resigned last July.

Wheeler's confirmation comes at a time when Congress is deeply divided among party lines over how to approach climate change and the environment, with some Democrats pushing for a “Green New Deal.” Wheeler also faces intense pressure from environmentalists after the Washington Post revealed earlier this month that EPA inspections are at a 10-year low. Inspections are a key tool the agency uses to regulate polluters.

In the months that Wheeler has been in office, he has undone Obama-era regulations on emissions from coal power plants and automobiles. He has also dismissed a scientific review panel that advised the EPA on air pollution regulation and weakened the criminal enforcement arm of the agency.


Executive order calls for sharp logging increase on public lands
January 15, 2019

Earlier this week, the Washington Postrevealed that President Donald Trump quietly issued an executive order to increase logging of forests on federal land on December 21, a day before the government shutdown. The order states that logging will prevent future wildfires like the deadly blazes seen in California last year.

Both the Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture have been instructed to harvest more than 4 billion board feet of timber that will then be put up for sale. That figure is 31 percent more than what the agencies logged in 2017.

Last November, President Trump published a series of tweets blaming poor forest management for the deadly fires that destroyed homes and lives in California. Though it was soon revealed that many of those forests were federally managed, firefighters noted that clearing dry debris was essential to preventing large fires because it removes potential fuel sources.

Speaking with the Washington Post, a fire ecologist from the University of Colorado Boulder said the increased logging might help quell a small percent of the fires that occur near homes but would do little to halt large-scale wildfires. Logging would also do nothing to fight fires fueled by dry brush.

Critics of the president's executive order also say the decision to log does little to address concerns from scientists that wildfires are more frequently being caused by climate change-induced conditions. Logging can also have other negative impacts, including disruption to wildlife habitat and erosion.


EPA criminal enforcements hit 30-year low
January 15, 2019

A report by the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) found the Environmental Protection Agency's criminal prosecutions under the Trump administration have been the lowest they've been in 30 years.

Much of the EPA's authority comes from the agency's ability to prosecute organizations that have violated environmental standards, but the Trump administration has been vocal about scaling back regulations and reducing EPA legal authority.

Only 166 referrals were sent to the Department of Justice during the last fiscal quarter. The EPA hasn't filed such few cases since the Reagan administration. Under the Clinton administration, criminal referrals reached just under 600.

In a press release, PEER attributed the steep decline to the agency's reduced budget for enforcement staff. Before leaving office, former administrator Scott Pruitt reportedly pulled agents from regional offices to staff his large security detail.

Last August, the agency also renamed their National Enforcement Initiative to the National Compliance Initiative. The change brought with it a softer approach to reprimanding polluters. For instance, a company could be allowed to negotiate an agreement to change their actions instead of facing prosecution. Though decried by environmentalists, the EPA says the change will help them tackle a broader scope of violations.

Environmental groups say not enforcing violations is a subtle way for the agency to scale back the EPA without passing large policy changes.


Trump nominates Andrew Wheeler to permanent EPA job
January 9, 2019

Though the federal government remains shut down, President Donald Trump officially nominated Acting Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler to the post on a permanent basis on Wednesday. Wheeler had served in the acting role since July, when former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned after intense media scrutiny and ethics scandals (see below).

Confirmed by the Senate as acting administrator, Wheeler will now need an additional confirmation for the permanent job.

The former coal lobbyist has largely continued Pruitt's legacy in office. In August Wheeler released a proposed rule that would roll back fuel-efficiency and pollution standards for vehicles, as well as limit California's ability to set its own car standards. Wheeler also unveiled a proposed replacement for the Obama-era Clean Power Plan that would let states set their own rules. In December Wheeler rolled out a weakened redo of the Waters of the United States rule, which would limit oversight of a range of activities from farming to industry.

Trump said Wheeler has ""done a fantastic job"" in his acting role.

“For me, there is no greater responsibility than protecting human health and the environment, and I look forward to carrying out this essential task on behalf of the American public,” Wheeler said in a statement upon his nomination.

“Wheeler has advanced the same destructive agenda as Pruitt, but without sideshow antics slowing him down,” Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “If he’s confirmed, Wheeler would surpass Pruitt as the most dangerous EPA administrator of all time. The Senate must not give him the chance.”

Trump Administration Rolls Back Obama-Era Coal Rules
December 6, 2018

The Trump administration rolled back another Obama-era climate rule when it announced Thursday it will lift some restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal power plants.

The change, intended to spur construction of new coal plants, comes as scientists warned world leaders attending the UN’s annual climate conference that the consequences of unchecked global warming will be severe and costly. The meeting opened with a warning from Polish President Andrzej Duda: “We are trying to save the world from annihilation…”

The easing of coal rules was announced by the Environmental Protection Agency’s acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, who said the move would “rescind excessive burdens on America’s energy providers and level the playing field so that new energy technologies can be part of America’s future.”

Proposed changes to the New Source Performance Standards would no longer require that plants meet strict goals of achieving emissions equal to or less than what plants would have achieved with carbon capture and storage technology.

The Obama administration rule, adopted in 2015, restricted carbon dioxide pollution from future power plants and prompted a strong pushback from the coal industry that complained it inhibited new plant construction. Equipment required under the Obama rule was expensive, and criticized by the energy industry as technologically unproven.

The announcement also came the day after the U.S. Energy Information Administration released figures for coal consumption in 2018 that show a four percent decline from 2017 and the lowest level since 1979. The largest consumer of coal is the electric power sector, and the decline reflects the closing of coal plants and competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources. Energy analysts have predicted that coal is unlikely to recover in the energy market it once dominated.

Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, who appeared by Wheeler’s side at the EPA press conference, praised the proposal because it will make it feasible for new plant construction.

Clare Lockwood, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the proposal an “act of flailing, die-hard climate denial.”

Interior Eases Drilling Controls Protecting Sage Grouse
December 6, 2018

The U.S. Interior Department moved forward Thursday with plans to ease restrictions on oil and gas drilling across millions of acres of protected habitat in 11 western states where the imperiled greater sage grouse lives.

Documents released by the Bureau of Land Management show the Trump administration’s intention to open more public lands to lease and allow waivers for drilling in the grouse breeding grounds. The plan is the next step in the administration’s efforts to rework Obama administration protections for the grouse. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke had promised to remove obstacles to drilling. Protections of the ground-dwelling grouse have long been viewed by the energy industry as an obstacle to development.

“I completely believe that these plans are leaning forward on conservation of sage grouse,” Interior Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt told the Associated Press. “Do they do it in exactly the same way, no? We made some change in the plans and got rid of some things that are simply not necessary.”

Conservationists and wildlife advocates vigorously disagreed and warned that drilling could further threaten the birds’ survival. The sage grouse once numbered in the millions. The population is now estimated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service between 200,000 and 500,000.

“David Bernhardt spent years in the private sector advancing policy goals of special interests who profit off our public lands. Despite his clear conflicts, Zinke put him in charge of ripping apart the plans just to help those very industries that Bernhardt used to work for,” Jayson O’Neill, deputy director of the Western Values Project, a Montana-based nonprofit focused on public lands protections, said in a statement.

The administration’s plans would modify protections in seven states, including Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, California, Idaho, and Oregon. The documents released Thursday include environmental analysis of the changes in each state plan. The public can comment on that analysis before a final decision, expected to be announced in early 2019.

NOAA green lights seismic airgun blasts for oil and gas drilling
November 30, 2018

Five oil and gas companies have been given the green light to use seismic airgun blasts to search for lucrative oil and gas deposits that could be buried in the sea floor from New Jersey to Florida.

The proposal was shot down by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in 2017 after it was deemed unsafe for marine life, but a recent review by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) concluded the blasts could be done without significantly threatening the population status of threatened or endangered species. The basis of NOAA's investigation was to determine whether or not the activity would violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

Large marine mammals like whales and dolphin use sound communicating, feeding, and mating, meaning the blasts could impact all three of those essential activities.

Keystone XL Pipeline Blocked by Federal Judge
November 8, 2018

A federal judge in Montana blocked construction from beginning on the Keystone XL pipeline, a 1,200-mile-long project that would deliver 800,000 barrels a day of crude oil from the Alberta, Canada, oil sands to refineries in the U.S. Pipeline operator TransCanada first proposed the pipeline in 2008; the Obama administration rejected its permit application in 2015, citing concerns about the pipeline's impact on climate. Trump reversed that decision shortly after he was inaugurated in 2017. (What is the Keystone XL pipeline?)

Judge Brian Morris wrote that the Trump administration had “simply discarded prior factual findings related to climate change” in order to move the project forward. In so doing it had violated its responsibility under the Administrative Procedures Act to provide a “reasoned explanation” for the changed decision. The Trump administration, Morris wrote, had failed to fully consider the climate, cultural, economic, and environmental impacts of the project—neither incorporating the latest science on climate change nor the impact on indigenous cultural resources in the pipeline's path.


The pipeline has been controversial since it was first proposed, with many environmental groups and indigenous communities strongly opposed to its construction. Construction work had been scheduled to begin in 2019. How long it will now be delayed is uncertain. The administration could appeal the ruling.

Youth Climate Change Lawsuit Delayed
November 8, 2018

The trial in a climate change lawsuit brought by 21 youths has been delayed again, after a federal appeals court granted the Trump administration’s request that it consider halting the case.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday gave the youths’ lawyers 15 days to respond to the government’s petition. In a meeting with lawyers, District Court Judge Ann Aiken indicated she will promptly set a new trial date once the appeals court lifts its temporary stay, according to Meg Ward, a spokeswoman for the youths.

The trial had been set to begin on October 29 in Eugene, but was delayed after the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene and halt it. On November 2, the justices refused and advised the government to return to the Ninth Circuit, which it did on November 5. Trump administration lawyers filed a rarely-used appeal that asks the appellate court to rule on the case before the lower court has heard it at trial.

Supreme Court Refuses to Halt Youths' Climate Change Suit
November 2, 2018

The Supreme Court on Friday refused to halt the trial in a case brought by 21 youths who sued the federal government for its role in causing global warming. The youths, many of whom live in regions already suffering the effects of climate change and extreme weather events, want a federal judge in Oregon to order the government to write a plan to address climate change.

The trial was to have begun October 29 in Eugene, but was delayed after the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intercede and block the case.

In a three-page unsigned order, the justices advised the government to take its arguments back to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and left open the possibility that the government court return to the Supreme Court. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch said they would have granted the administration’s request. The other seven justices did not indicate how they decided the government’s appeal.

The justices noted the government’s description of the case as “based on an assortment of unprecedented legal theories, such as a substantive due process right to certain conditions, and an equal protection right to live in the same climate as enjoyed by prior generations.”

The order was the second time since July the justices denied the government’s effort to stop the case as premature.

Lawyers for the youths announced they would ask that the trial begin next week.

“The youth of our nation won an important decision today from the Supreme Court that shows even the most powerful government in the world must follow the rules and process of litigation in our democracy,” Julia Olson, executive director of Our Children’s Trust and the co-counsel in the lawsuit, said in a statement.

The case of Juliana v. United States was filed in 2015 during the Obama administration. The youths’ suit contends that the federal government pursued energy policies that caused climate change even though it knew for more than a half-century that carbon emissions would destabilize the climate, and the failure to protect future generations from the effects of climate change violated their generations’ constitutional right to live in a “climate system capable of sustaining human life.”

Both the Obama and Trump administration lawyers have argued repeatedly in numerous appeals that the policy-making on climate change does not belong in court, but more properly in the realm of Congress and the federal agencies that write laws and government regulations. The youths “seek nothing less than a complete transformation of the American energy system–including the abandonment of fossil fuels–ordered by a single district court….” Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote in a brief. He added: the “assertion of sweeping new fundamental rights to certain climate conditions has no basis in the nation’s history and tradition–and no place in federal court.”

In response to the government’s appeal, the youths’ lawyers argued that constitutional questions are traditionally addressed after trial, when a record of fact has been established, and not before. As to the potential injury, the lawyers wrote: “When a child suffers climate-induced flooding where the child sleeps, increased incidence of asthma attacks from climate-induced wildfire and smoke conditions in areas where the child exercises, dead coral reefs due to overly warm oceans where the child swims, and storm surges and rising seas perpetually attacking the barrier island where the child lives so that the child now routinely evacuates and experiences flooding in the child’s roads, home and school, those injuries are hardly generalized grievances.”

First offshore oil wells approved for the Arctic
October 24, 2018

After years of heated debate between conservationists and the petroleum industry about risks and rewards, the federally controlled waters of the U.S. Arctic are cleared to see their first oil and gas production wells. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a conditional permit to Houston-based Hilcorp to move forward with its Liberty Project, to begin drilling from an artificial island in the Beaufort Sea.

In announcing the approval, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, “Responsibly developing our resources, in Alaska especially, will allow us to use our energy diplomatically to aid our allies and check our adversaries.”

But environmentalists are concerned that the region's harsh climate, and threatened wildlife, make the project a risky gamble.

“Opening the Arctic to offshore oil drilling is a disaster waiting to happen,” Kristen Monsell, ocean legal director with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “This project sets us down a dangerous path of destroying the Arctic. An oil spill in the Arctic would be impossible to clean up and the region is already stressed by climate change.”

Hilcorp intends to move forward by creating a gravel island in 19 feet of water about 5.6 miles off Alaska's north shore. The island would have a footprint covering 24 acres of seafloor and an area above the surface of about 9 acres. The site lies a few miles east of the massive Prudhoe Bay oil field.

Hilcorp says it hopes to extract 60,000 to 70,000 barrels per day from up to 16 wells on the island, for a total haul of 80 million to 130 million barrels over 15 to 20 years. Oil will be conveyed via an underwater pipeline.

Regulators pointed to safety features in approving the plan, including a promise to only drill into oil-bearing rock when the Arctic is frozen and restrictions on ship traffic.

But environmentalists challenge that any cleanup efforts in the remote north would be exceedingly difficult. Noise and traffic to the island may disturb whales, seals, and other wildlife, Monsell said.

U.S. pushes to end children's climate change suit
October 19, 2018

A week before the start of a trial in a case brought by 21 children who sued the U.S. government for its role in causing climate change, the government is moving aggressively to end the case.

After failing to convince the Supreme Court to end the case in July, the Justice Department returned to the court this week to ask for a second time that the suit be blocked. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, in a new 38-page filing, asked the justices again to intervene and “end this profoundly misguided suit.”

On Friday, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted the case and has given the lawyers for the children until Wednesday to respond.

The youths contend that the U.S. government has pursued energy policies that caused climate change, despite knowing for more than 50 years that carbon emissions would destabilize the climate; they argue the failure to protect future generations from the effects of climate change violate their generation’s constitutional right to a “climate system capable of sustaining human life.”

The trial in the case of Juliana v. United States is scheduled to being Oct. 29 in Eugene, Oregon.

In a statement, Julia Olson, the youth’s co-counsel and executive director of Our Children’s Trust, expressed confidence in a statement that the trial will proceed once the justices receive the youth plaintiffs’ response to the government’s “mischaracterization” of the case.

“As the Supreme Court has recognized in innumerable cases, review of constitutional questions is better done on a full record where evidence is presented and weighed by the trier of fact,” Olson said. “This case is already about recognized fundamental rights and children’s rights of equal protection under the law.”

The government’s new appeal to the Supreme Court came as both sides await a ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the government’s effort to end the case.

“We are now facing a legal case where the district court is considering a matter, the Ninth Circuit is considering the same matter, and the Supreme Court has been asked to consider the matter,” says Phil Gregory, the youth’s co-counsel. “Every legal scholar I’ve talked to says they have never seen this before. It’s unprecedented.”

In July, when the Supreme Court justices declined to intercede, calling it “premature,” they also noted the “breadth” of some of the claims were “striking,” and that there are “substantial grounds for a difference of opinion.” The justices cautioned U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken to “take these concerns into account” when moving toward trial.

On Monday, in a sweeping ruling, Aiken rejected the government’s efforts to limit the case, although granted the government’s request to dismiss President Trump as a defendant. She ordered the case to proceed to trial as scheduled.

In the government’s new filing, Francisco argued that Aiken had failed to follow the high court’s admonishment to “meaningfully narrow” the case. He also harshly criticized the lawsuit, arguing that not only has the case cost “taxpayers millions of dollars” as government lawyers prepare for the court battle, but that the lawsuit itself is merely an “attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process.”

The government also moved this week, in a filing dated Oct. 15, to exclude climate experts from testifying for the plaintiffs because the government does not dispute their conclusions about climate change. That was a day after Trump, in an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, conceded that “something’s happening” to the climate, but added: “I don’t know that it’s man-made.”

President Trump Signs Bill to Clean Up Ocean Plastics
October 12, 2018

President Trump called out other nations, including China and Japan, for “making our oceans into their landfills” when he signed legislation last week to improve efforts to clean up plastic trash from the world’s oceans.

“As president, I will continue to do everything I can to stop other nations from making our oceans into their landfills,” Trump said at a White House signing ceremony. “That’s why I’m please—very pleased, I must say—to put my signature on this important legislation.”

The law, passed with bipartisan support, amends the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Marine Debris Act and funds the program through 2022. The law fosters efforts to clean up plastic trash from the world’s oceans and encourages federal trade negotiators to prod “leaders of nations responsible for the majority of marine debris” to improve management of waste that ends up in the oceans.

Trump agreed with Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, that trade talks with the Philippines should include plastic waste. “We’re okay with that,” he said. “I understand. A lot comes from there.”

Trump also blamed other unnamed countries that “abuse the oceans” and whose trash floats to the West Coast of the United States,” creating, he said, “a very unfair situation.”

“It’s incredible. It’s incredible when you look at it,” Trump said. “People don’t realize it, but all the time we’re being inundated by debris from other countries.”

Comparatively, the beaches of the United States are among the world’s cleanest. Kamilo Beach in Hawaii, which faces the Pacific gyre, where ocean trash collects, is the exception. But most of the world’s plastic trash collects in coastal regions and on beaches in developing nations that lack adequate municipal waste collection systems.

Japan has had for years one of the world’s highest recycling rates and earlier this year, China stopped buying the world’s trash. The United States was one of the top sellers of recycled plastic to China.

EPA to Disband Air Pollution Review Panel
October 11, 2018

The Environmental Protection Agency will not continue a scientific review panel that advises the agency about safe levels of pollution in the air, the New York Times reports.

The 20-member Particulate Matter Review Panel has been made up of scientists who are experts in the health dangers of soot. That panel will no longer meet next year, though the agency declined to disclose why.

Conservation groups have complained that eliminating the panel will make it easier to roll back pollution standards or push through other changes with less regard to the impact on human health.

The agency has said that a seven-member panel will review federal air standards going forward, with the goal of more revisions by 2020. Conservationists have warned that this group currently only includes one independent researcher and may not be robust enough to protect public health.

Ban on Mining Near Yellowstone Extended
October 8, 2018

U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke extended a ban on mining in a 30,000-acre area of his home state near Yellowstone National Park. Known as Paradise Valley, that part of southwestern Montana is popular with outdoor enthusiasts and tourists and is known for pricey second homes. Attractive to mining companies in recent years, the parcel of federal land is managed by the U.S. Forest Service.

Zinke's order extends the ban on all mineral extraction on the federal land for another 20 years, the maximum allowed by law. The previous Interior secretary, Sally Jewel, had enacted a two-year ban while more studies of the area were made. Meanwhile, mining companies had been making some exploratory efforts on nearby private land.

“I fully support multiple use of public lands, but multiple use is about balance and knowing that not all areas are right for all uses. There are places where it is appropriate to mine and places where it is not. Paradise Valley is one of the areas it's not,” Zinke said when extending the ban, as reported by The Hill.

The ban was supported by Montana's entire delegation to Congress—who have also floated a bill to make it permanent—and had strong bipartisan support in the state. It was opposed by the state's mining association.

While praising the move, Aaron Weiss of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities also noted that “Secretary Zinke always seems to support conservation in his home state of Montana, while backing the most aggressive forms of industrial development in the other 49 states.""

Weiss pointed to recent efforts supported by Zinke to expand mining in Bears Ears, Grand Staircase-Escalante, and the Boundary Waters as examples of the latter.

Report: Trump Administration Predicts 7 Degrees of Global Warming by 2100
September 28, 2018

A Washington Post story highlights a startling footnote in a U.S. government agency report: a forecast that global carbon emissions will nearly double by 2100. Trump administration officials are using the dire forecast to support a rollback of Obama-era fuel efficiency standards that would increase U.S. carbon emissions.

The draft report, recently published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), intends to justify the SAFE Vehicles Rule, the Trump administration's proposed changes to fuel efficiency standards for model year 2021-2026 passenger cars and light trucks. Trump officials would prefer to freeze these average fuel economy standards to 37 miles per gallon. The Obama-era policy would have made these standards stricter over time, to an average of 46.7 miles per gallon for model year 2025 vehicles.

According to the NHTSA report, this change would increase these vehicles' carbon emissions by nine percent from 2021 through the end of the century, an upswing of about 7.8 billion tons of CO2. But to minimize this impact, the report emphasizes that the rollback would increase global CO2 levels by “just” 0.65 parts per million—from a baseline of 789.11 parts per million.

It's this baseline estimate that's raising eyebrows. Currently, global CO2 levels are about 410 parts per million, smashing natural CO2 records from the last 800,000 years by a third. The last time CO2 levels were this high, roughly three million years ago, sea levels were 20 feet higher than they are today.

Against this backdrop, setting a 2100 baseline of 789 parts per million is astonishing. For one, this forecast assumes that the Paris Agreement makes no dent in global CO2 levels in coming decades. The global pact calls for limiting warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, four degrees less than the NHTSA predicts. A full seven degrees would mark a dramatic twist of Earth's thermostat knob: From the height of the last ice age to now, tropical sea surface temperatures have increased by roughly that much.

In an interview with the Washington Post, MIT Sloan School of Management professor John Sterman called the forecast “a textbook example of how to lie with statistics.”

“First, the administration proposes vehicle efficiency policies that would do almost nothing [to fight climate change],” he said. “Then [the administration] makes their impact seem even smaller by comparing their proposals to what would happen if the entire world does nothing.”

The Trump administration says the rule is a necessary safety fix, arguing that it would lower the cost of newer vehicles and thus encourage people to get newer, safer cars. In an August 2018 story in the New York Times, outside experts questioned these arguments.

EPA Repeals Obama-Era Methane Rules
September 18, 2018

This week, the Trump administration Environmental Protection Agency announced final new rollbacks to Obama-era climate change policy, reducing requirements on oil and gas companies to monitor and mitigate releases of methane from wells and other operations.

Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas and regularly seeps from energy activities. Some in the industry had complained that the Obama-era rules were too burdensome.

The Interior Department is also expected to soon release a plan to return to allowing companies to intentionally flare off methane, an activity that environmentalists had said was wasteful and contributing to carbon emissions.

Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, praised the new changes to the New York Times. The Obama rules were ""a record-keeping nightmare that was technically impossible to execute in the field,” she told the paper. Yet environmentalists warn that more leaks will lead to more pollution.

The rules allow companies to follow laxer state guidelines and decrease the time required between inspections of equipment and for repairing leaks. The 2016 rule was expected to cost the industry $530 million by 2025. Yet the Obama administration had estimated that the fuel being wasted by leaks actually costs taxpayers $330 million a year in lost natural gas royalties.

When the new EPA rule was announced attorneys general in California and New Mexico filed suit, challenging the change.

 

Trump EPA Unveils Plan to Nullify Federal Rules on Coal Power Plants
August 21, 2018

As a candidate, one of Donald Trump’s signature promises was to weaken air pollution rules on coal-fired power plants. In a speech in West Virginia Tuesday, President Trump detailed the Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to reverse Obama Administration rules designed to curtail coal emissions of carbon dioxide and methane that contribute to climate change.

The Trump Administration’s new plan—called the Affordable Clean Energy rule—dismantles Obama’s federal rules over all American coal plants and gives regulating authority to each state. Some states, like California, may propose even harsher targets. But others, such as coal-rich states like West Virginia and Pennsylvania, are likely to loosen emissions regulations that coal industry leaders have called burdensome and expensive.

Despite legal challenges to the Obama plan, known as the Clean Power Plan, coal plants have declined in recent years. Since 2010, more than 200 American coal plants have been retired or taken offline. In that time, other energy sources including renewables like wind and solar have become more cost-effective and reliable. Yet Trump’s rules are likely to most affect aging coal plants across the country that pollute the most, making them more cost effective to run longer.

The move is likely to have a lasting effect on climate change. The U.S. is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses. Obama’s Clean Power Plan had intended to cut U.S. emissions 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. By the same measure, the Trump plan is expected to cut emissions only as much as 1.5 percent.

After the rule is submitted to the Federal Register, the public will have 60 days to comment before it is finalized. Environmental groups are expected to challenge it in court.

Trump Announces Plan to Weaken Obama-Era Fuel Economy Rules
August 2, 2018

The Trump administration announced a long-expected plan to dismantle an Obama-era policy that would have increased vehicle mileage standards for cars made over the next decade. The Obama rules were intended to limit vehicle emissions of greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change.

The vehicle emissions standards had been one of the signature policies of the Obama administration to confront climate change. They required light cars made after 2012 to become almost twice as efficient by 2025—averaging nearly 54 miles per gallon—in hopes of saving billions of barrels of oil needed to burn for fuel.

The Trump administration proposal, announced by both the Department or Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency, wouldn't nix the rules entirely but would halt the mileage targets at 34 miles per gallon by 2021. Beyond that number, some automakers complained, the targets would be too difficult to reach, and the added expense to innovate technology and alter production lines would cost jobs and increase prices for car buyers.

Other carmakers approved of the Obama rules, acknowledging that even if they were burdensome, they leveled the playing field for all automakers in all states, ensuring that no company could sell cheaper, less-efficient cars while others tried to innovate.

DOT and EPA officials cited passenger safety as their primary objective in rolling back the rules. People who owned more efficient cars would drive more, they said, putting them at greater risk of accidents. They also said that cars with better mileage would delay people from getting new cars with enhanced safety features. Some experts interviewed by the New York Times expressed skepticism at these explanations.

The Trump administration's move sets up a legal battle with more than a dozen states, led by California, that have passed their own set of higher fuel standards. Despite the relief from the Trump Administration's move, several companies have urged the administration to return to negotiations with states to agree on a uniform set of standards across the country. They argued that a fragmented system between federal and state rules, like the one Trump's rollback creates, would be a worst-case scenario.

Supreme Court Lets Children's Climate Change Lawsuit Move to Trial
July 30, 2018

Juliana v. United States, a lawsuit filed by 21 children against the federal government over climate change, is headed to trial later this year, after the Supreme Court rejected the Trump Administration’s efforts to derail the case.

In a four-sentence order issued July 30, Justice Anthony Kennedy rejected the government’s request that the case be stayed as “premature.” Kennedy noted that the “breadth of the (children’s) claim is striking…” But he cautioned that the complicated case presents “substantial grounds for difference of opinion” and warned the trial court to “take these concerns into account in assessing the burdens of discovery and trial…”

The trial is scheduled to begin October 29 in Eugene, Oregon.

- Laura Parker

The children’s suit, filed in federal court in 2015 by the non-profit Our Children’s Trust, alleges that the government has failed to protect Earth from the effects of climate change, putting the lives of future generations at risk and violating their basic constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property.

The Obama Administration sought unsuccessfully to have the case dismissed, arguing remedies for climate change are better addressed by Congress than in court. The Trump Administration was named as a defendant in the case in January 2017. In March, Trump Administration lawyers filed the first of several attempts to have the case dismissed or delayed. None succeeded, prompting the appeal to the high court.

Trump Officials Set Aside Evidence of National Monuments' Successes
July 23, 2018

As the Trump administration downsized Utah's Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments and reviewed dozens more, U.S. Department of the Interior officials dismissed evidence that the monument designations brought benefits, the Washington Post reports.

On July 16, the Interior Department's Freedom of Information Act team uploaded thousands of pages of documents that had not been completely redacted. The next day, officials took down these documents and replaced them.

The erroneously un-redacted documents contain facts that cast some monuments in a positive light. One 2017 analysis by the Bureau of Land Management mentioned that once Grand Staircase-Escalante became a national monument, the annual rate of archaeological listings in the area more than doubled, and vandalism dropped. In December 2017, President Trump moved to shrink the monument by 46 percent.

In another document, Interior Department official Randal Bowman recommended deleting fishing data from an assessment of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. The administration reviewed the Atlantic Ocean monument—which President Obama created in 2016—amid concerns that the monument's ban on fishing hurt local fishers.

Bowman sought to nix data showing that from 2005 to 2014, about two-thirds of the area's shipping vessels generated less than five percent of their annual landings from the waters that became the monument.

“This section is based on information provided by NOAA and the Fishery Management Council, and so can be presumed accurate,” he wrote in a comment. “However, including all this information undercuts the case for the ban being harmful.”

According to legal experts interviewed by the Post, Trump officials could argue that the intended redactions fall under the “deliberative privilege” exemption of the Freedom of Information Act. That clause aims to protect executive branch staffers as they honestly discuss and hone policies.

Trump Officials Propose Rollbacks of Endangered Species Act Rules
July 19, 2018

On Thursday, the Trump administration unveiled a proposal that would make several key changes to the Endangered Species Act—the 1973 law that has served as a bulwark against the bald eagle's extinction, among thousands of other species.

The plan calls for nixing a rule that forbids referring to the economic impacts of listing an endangered or threatened species. That said, the plan makes pains to say that determinations would still be based only on biological considerations. It also would give regulators greater freedom to avoid designating critical habitat for threatened and endangered species.

It also would tweak how the risks facing threatened species—which aren't endangered yet but could be in the foreseeable future—would be weighed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would constrain the definition of “foreseeable future” to “only so far into the future as the Services can reasonably determine that the conditions potentially posing a danger of extinction in the foreseeable future are probable.”

What's more, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed eliminating the blanket section 4(d) rule. Since the 1970s, this FWS policy gave threatened species all the protections given to endangered species, which face a more immediate risk of extinction, by default.

Unlike FWS, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service tacks on protections for threatened species one by one. The new proposal calls on FWS to adopt NOAA's case-by-case approach for future listings of threatened species. The hundreds of threatened plants and animals that currently have blanket 4(d) protections will continue to have them, according to FWS.

Already, environmental groups are strongly criticizing the plan.

“These proposals would slam a wrecking ball into the most crucial protections for our most endangered wildlife,” added Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “If these regulations had been in place in the 1970s, the bald eagle and the gray whale would be extinct today. If they’re finalized now, Zinke will go down in history as the extinction secretary.”

The proposed changes will be posted to the Federal Register in a matter of days. The Trump administration has invited public comment on the rules, which will be open for 60 days on regulations.gov after they are posted.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Resigns
July 5, 2018

EPA administrator Scott Pruitt resigned on Thursday, ending the tenure of the most divisive U.S. environmental lead in decades.

Pruitt's resignation, confirmed by President Trump in a statement on Twitter, comes after months of criticism and an ever-growing pile of ethics scandals.

Media reports found that Pruitt had racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in first-class flights, a $43,000 soundproof office phone booth, and more than $1,500 in fountain pens. A recent CNN report also alleges that Pruitt made his staff omit parts of his schedule from the public record.

Pruitt also caught fire for asking his staff for personal help. Pruitt reportedly asked his unprecedentedly large security detail to turn on their emergency lights as he ran late to a meal at a chic D.C. French restaurant. He also asked his detail to track down his favorite lotion, and he asked his top aides to retrieve his dry cleaning, pick up snacks, track down used hotel mattresses, and help find his wife a job.

Beyond his cavalcade of scandals, Pruitt also brought abrupt changes to U.S. environmental policy.

He halted an Obama-era request that fossil-fuel producers track methane emissions and overruled EPA scientists' plea to ban the insecticide chlorpyrifos. While Pruitt's EPA moved to make the water contaminant PFAS a national priority, officials also reportedly sought to delay a CDC report about the compound's toxicity.

The EPA under Pruitt moved hastily to end the Obama administration's signature environmental policies. Pruitt stalled the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration's effort to regulate power-plant emissions; wanted to weaken 2022-2025 car fuel economy standards; delayed the “Waters of the United States” rule for two years; and wanted to downwardly revise the “social cost of carbon,” a crucial stat when weighing the costs and benefits of fighting climate change.

Pruitt also advocated for the U.S. to leave the Paris climate accords—leaving the U.S. globally isolated on what scientists broadly agree is an environmental crisis.

In a contentious letter recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, two Harvard University researchers argue that the Trump administration's environmental policies, as championed by Pruitt, could kill an additional 80,000 people per decade when compared to prior policy.

Deputy EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, is now acting EPA administrator. He is widely expected to continue Pruitt’s policies.

White House Cuts NASA Climate Monitoring Program
May 9, 2018

Science magazine reports that the Trump administration has ended NASA's Carbon Monitoring System, a $10-million-per-year effort to fund pilot programs intended to improve the monitoring of global carbon emissions.

Congress directed the CMS's creation in 2010, but as Science reporter Paul Voosen notes, the March 2018 spending deal didn't specifically dedicate funds to the program—giving the White House sufficient latitude to wind it down. Researchers say that CMS-supported work is particularly relevant to the global Paris Agreement, especially for verifying whether the nations of the world are actually meeting their pledges to reduce carbon emissions.

“If you cannot measure emissions reductions, you cannot be confident that countries are adhering to the agreement,” said Kelly Sims Gallagher, a Tufts University climate policy expert, in an interview with Science.

The move marks the latest efforts of the Trump administration, which has rejected the Paris Agreement and an array of prior U.S. climate policies, to downsize NASA's climate science program. The White House has repeatedly called for the elimination of CMS and several other NASA climate missions, including the planned PACE, OCO-3, and CLARREO Pathfinder instruments. Trump officials also advocate the shutdown of the Earth-viewing instruments aboard DSCOVR, which have taken high-res pictures of our planet's sunlit half nearly every hour since July 2015.

Despite the closure of CMS, NASA will continue to operate several climate-monitoring satellites, and the agency is scheduled to launch two climate instruments to the International Space Station by the end of 2018. “The winding down of the CMS research program does not curb NASA’s ability or commitment to monitoring carbon and its effects on our changing planet,"" said NASA spokesperson Steve Cole in a statement to National Geographic.

Yet researchers contend that without CMS's support, research into how to make sense of these data will slow.

“The topic of climate mitigation and carbon monitoring is maybe not the highest priority now in the United States,” said University of Maryland climate scientist George Hurtt, the CMS science team leader, in an interview with Science. “But it is almost everywhere else.”

EPA Issues Controversial Rule on Science 'Transparency'
April 24, 2018

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt proposed a rule Tuesday that would only allow the agency to consider in its rule making scientific studies for which the underlying data are made available publicly. “The science that we use is going to be transparent. It’s going to be reproducible,” Pruitt told reporters.

Industry and conservative groups have called for this change for some time, while some environmental groups warn that it could reduce the EPA's ability to consider all the evidence available when making rules on tough questions like power plant emissions and the safety of everything from pesticides to consumer products.

In a letter, nearly 1,000 scientists (many of whom used to work at the EPA) asked Pruitt to abandon the proposal, which they said “would greatly weaken EPA's ability to comprehensively consider the scientific evidence.” Much of the data that would be excluded is based on reviews of personal health information, which is often not publicly available because of privacy laws or practical challenges.

“This proposal would mean throwing out the studies we rely on to protect the public, for no good reason,” said Betsy Southerland, a longtime EPA scientist, in a press release from the Union of Concerned Scientists. “This would have an enormous and negative impact on the EPA’s ability to enforce the law and protect people’s health. Administrator Pruitt can’t carry out the basic responsibilities of his job if he insists that his agency ignore the evidence.”

The rule change is subject to a 30-day public comment period.

Threatened Species Protection Rule Under Review
April 2, 2018

The White House is currently reviewing a regulation that some environmental groups fear could nix protections granted to nearly 300 threatened species.

In a surprise rule change submitted on Monday, the U.S. Department of the Interior has proposed removing what's called the “blanket section 4(d) rule.” Since the 1970s, this U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) policy has stated that by default, threatened species receive the full protections of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

The ESA affords wide-ranging protections to species on the brink of extinction, barring everything from outright poaching to coming too close to the species in the wild. These restrictions don't automatically apply to threatened species, but section 4(d) of the ESA says that departments can protect threatened species at their discretion.

Historically, different departments have used this discretion in different ways. By default, FWS's blanket section 4(d) rule gives threatened species every ESA protection, which regulators then clarify and whittle down. When the National Marine Fisheries Service lists a threatened species, however, it adds protections bit by bit.

The proposed removal of the blanket section 4(d) rule concerns environmental groups because it's possible that the move would jeopardize protections for hundreds of threatened species, which aren't yet facing the threat of extinction but could in the future.

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group, 294 species listed as threatened by the FWS are afforded protections only because of the blanket rule. The affected species include the northern spotted owl, the southern sea otter, the spotted seal, as well as eight species of coral and numerous plants.

“How are they going to deal with the species that are already listed as threatened?” asks Noah Greenwald, the endangered species director of the Center for Biological Diversity. “I think that's pretty critical, because there's no way they can publish 300 individual rules ... This certainly looks like a regulatory rollback.”

That said, the rule change's impact remains unclear. The proposed regulation hasn't been released, and once it is, it will be subject to a period of public comment. The Interior Department has not yet responded to National Geographic's emailed questions about the proposed rule change.

“The Center for Biological Diversity thinks it's the worst-case scenario—it's hard for me to assume that,” says Defenders of Wildlife vice president Bob Dreher, an FWS associate director during the Obama administration. “We are of course concerned, and we're going to be watching it very, very carefully.”

In gearing up for the rule change, the Trump administration appears to be responding to two legal petitions filed in 2016 by the Pacific Legal Foundation—a conservative public-interest law firm—on behalf of the Washington Cattlemen's Association and the National Federation of Independent Businesses.

The groups argue that by giving threatened species all ESA protections as a default, the blanket rule functionally eliminates the distinction between endangered and threatened species. They say the arrangement illegally flouts Congress and penalizes private landowners.

Jonathan Wood, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, maintains that rescinding the blanket rule won't hurt conservation. He argues that if threatened species have fewer protections than endangered species, then private landowners have an incentive to help endangered species recover to threatened status—since the upgrade in status removes onerous regulations. (Read more about the debate over the Endangered Species Act.)

“Recovery for endangered species is abysmally low ... By varying the protections, you better align the incentives of the property owners with the incentives of the endangered species,” he says. “Ideally, we boost that recovery rate.”

Environmental groups and Wood disagree vehemently on the ESA's efficacy. But they agree on one major point: the text of the regulation may take months to be released, and until then, it's unclear how threatened species will be treated.

“Without seeing the proposed rule and the reasons it gives, it's hard to say too much,” says Wood.

That said, Dreher offers a word of caution to the Department of the Interior: “If they take an approach which leaves threatened species arbitrarily unprotected, you can be sure that we and other organizations will sue.”

EPA Starts Rollback of Car Emissions Standards
April 2, 2018

In a press release, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced that the U.S. government would revisit the Obama administration's fuel efficiency standards for cars and light-duty trucks—the first step in a rollback of one of the U.S.'s biggest efforts to curb carbon emissions.

In July 2011, President Obama announced he would tighten regulations of vehicle greenhouse gas emissions, with rules that were first finalized in August 2012. Under Obama-era policy, cars and light-duty trucks would be required to have average fuel efficiencies equivalent to 54.5 miles per gallon by model year 2025.

About a sixth of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 came from passenger cars and light-duty trucks. Overall, the Obama program would've reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons—more than the total CO2 the U.S. emitted in 2016.

The EPA committed to finishing a midterm evaluation of the 2022-2025 standards by no later than April 1, 2018. On January 12, 2017, outgoing Obama EPA administrator Gina McCarthy finalized the evaluation and reaffirmed the stringent emissions standards.

At the time, car manufacturers argued that the 2022-2025 standards were unrealistic, expensive, and politically rushed. The Trump administration has enthusiastically echoed these sentiments; it restarted the midterm evaluation in March 2017.

“The Obama administration's determination was wrong,” Pruitt said in a statement. “Obama’s EPA cut the Midterm Evaluation process short with politically charged expediency, made assumptions about the standards that didn’t comport with reality, and set the standards too high.”

Automakers struck a guardedly pleased tone in releases about the announcement, seemingly leery that they may be getting more rollbacks out of the Trump EPA than they originally bargained for. Already, environmental and public health groups are voicing fierce opposition.

“Starting a process to weaken clean car standards marks yet another step backward from the fight to curb climate change,” said Harold P. Wimmer, the national president and CEO of the American Lung Association, in a statement. “Climate change poses serious threats to millions of people, especially to some of the most vulnerable Americans, including children, older adults and those living with chronic diseases such as asthma.”

“Pruitt’s rollback of the EPA clean car standards is a U-turn in the fight against climate change. We don’t know exactly how far the agency will back-track until they publish new standards, but we can be sure that it will make achieving a low-carbon transportation system more difficult and likely more expensive,” wrote Luke Tonachel, the clean vehicles director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.

Globally, lowering U.S. emissions standards could bolster other countries to weaken their own emissions standards. Within the U.S., a rollback would set up a legal trench war between the EPA and the state of California. Under a waiver it received at the dawn of the EPA, California has the authority to set its own, more stringent emissions standards. Twelve other states and the District of Columbia—in all, a third of the U.S. population—follow California's lead.

“We’re ready to file suit if needed to protect these critical standards and to fight the administration’s war on our environment,” said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a statement. “California didn’t become the sixth-largest economy in the world by spectating.”

Zinke Offers Support for Grizzlies in North Cascades
March 23, 2018

In a move that pleased conservationists and infuriated cattlemen, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke announced his support for efforts to return the grizzly bear to the North Cascades ecosystem.

""The grizzly bear is part of the environment, as it once was here. It's part of a healthy environment,"" he said according to The Seattle Times.

Zinke said that by the end of 2018, U.S. officials would complete a plan for returning the grizzly bear to the North Cascades, a rugged ecosystem that straddles the U.S. state of Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that fewer than 50 grizzly bears now live in the region, which is isolated from other grizzly populations in North America.

In 2013, the Fish and Wildlife Service found that the North Cascades grizzly bear warranted an endangered listing under the Endangered Species Act. The following year, the Seattle Times reports that the Obama administration announced a three-year recovery study. In 2017, the study was halted; now, with Zinke's support, it will presumably continue.

FEMA Expels ""Climate Change"" From Strategic Plan
March 16, 2018

NPR reports that the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has stricken “climate change” and associated verbiage from its strategic plan, on the heels of one of the most expensive years of natural disasters in modern U.S. history.

The plan, published on March 15, says that one of the agency’s major strategic goals is to “ready the nation for catastrophic disasters.” As NPR noted, it does discuss the potential for rising disaster costs:

Disaster costs are expected to continue to increase due to rising natural hazard risk, decaying critical infrastructure, and economic pressures that limit investments in risk resilience. As good stewards of taxpayer dollars, FEMA must ensure that our programs are fiscally sound. Additionally, we will consider new pathways to long-term disaster risk reduction, including increased investments in pre-disaster mitigation.

In a statement to NPR, FEMA Public Affairs Director William Booher said that “this strategic plan fully incorporates future risks from all hazards regardless of cause.”

In the plan, FEMA does not elaborate on the causes of “rising natural hazard risk,” which include human-caused climate change. As National Geographic previously reported, two recent studies found that the record rainfall from Hurricane Harvey—which cost roughly $125 billion—got a 15-percent boost thanks to climate change. The studies also found that climate change roughly tripled the odds of a storm of Harvey’s intensity.

The threats of climate change featured in FEMA strategic plans drafted under the Obama administration, as well as earlier ones. In a 2008 strategic plan drafted under the George W. Bush administration, then-FEMA director R. David Paulison said that future years “will likely present our nation with equally challenging events, including technological incidents, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or extreme weather events spawned by global warming.”

EPA Mulls Shake-Up to Environmental Research Program
February 26, 2018

The Trump administration is thinking about reorganizing an EPA group that funds research on children’s health and environmental health disparities affecting minorities and the poor.

According to the proposal, the EPA would consolidate its National Center for Environmental Research (NCER), a branch of the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, with two other offices related to grant-making. The combined office would field Freedom of Information Requests, manage EPA records, and administer grants.

In a statement to Earther, EPA spokesperson Liz Bowman said that the move is intended to make the agency more efficient. She added that the management of research grants would continue and that none of NCER’s current staff would be fired.

When news of the reorganization first broke, some raised concerns that NCER’s work would fall by the wayside. Currently, NCER oversees EPA’s STAR (Science to Achieve Results) program, which issues grants and fellowships to outside environmental researchers. STAR funding helps support the U.S.’s Children’s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers, which examine pollution’s effects on children’s health.

In 2017, STAR earned acclaim from the National Academies—the U.S.’s preeminent scientific body—for its support of high-quality science, including work showing that infants could be exposed to arsenic via rice cereal. Yet from 2002 to 2016, STAR’s budget declined by more than 70 percent (adjusting for inflation) to $36 million, E&E News reports. In its FY2019 budget request, the Trump EPA called for STAR’s elimination.

In an interview with National Geographic, a senior EPA official said that the reorganized office would continue STAR if Congress funds it. The official added that new STAR grants would probably dovetail with the EPA’s priorities under administrator Scott Pruitt, which the agency laid out in its 2018-2022 strategic plan.

Pruitt’s “back-to-basics” plan calls for a focus on maintaining air quality, implementing recent chemical-safety reforms, funding infrastructure for drinking water, and accelerating the cleanup of Superfund sites. Missing from the document is any mention of climate change or carbon dioxide, points of emphasis in Obama-era EPA strategic plans.

Trump Proposes Cuts to Climate and Clean-Energy Programs
February 12, 2018

In its FY2019 budget and addendum, the Trump administration has proposed sweeping rollbacks to U.S. programs designed to study and mitigate the effects of climate change, as well as cuts to research on renewable energy.

At this point, the budget is merely an opening bid in negotiations with Congress; last year, lawmakers largely ignored similar proposed cuts. Nevertheless, the budget provides insight into the White House's priorities.

For instance, the EPA budget suggests eliminating the environmental agency's climate-change research program, which currently costs the agency $16 million per year. In addition, the EPA has proposed axing several voluntary emissions-reductions programs and STAR, which funds environmental research and graduate student fellowships.

Other parts of the budget trim environmental services, such as the EPA's Report on the Environment, and cut the agency's Human Health Risk Assessment program by nearly 40 percent.

As it did in 2017, the Trump administration has proposed axing several NASA Earth-science missions, including PACE and OCO-3. (Read more about the targeted missions.)

The budget also calls for shutting down the Earth-facing instruments aboard DSCOVR, which is already flying. These instruments include EPIC, which continually photographs Earth's sunlit half to measure the planet's energy budget.

The White House has proposed eliminating the U.S. State Department's Global Climate Change Initiative, which in 2017 received $160 million in funding. The program primarily aims to help other countries better weather the impacts of climate change. Though most developing countries did little to contribute to ongoing climate change, developing countries will be more severely affected.

The Trump administration's 2019 budget also advocates for a 55-percent cut in spending on the Department of Energy's applied R&D programs. The cuts would shrink the agency's $3.77-billion budget to slightly less than $1.7 billion. In its justification, the White House says that the move would refocus R&D efforts from late-stage development to early-stage research.

At the same time, the budget cuts investments in early-stage research by axing ARPA-E, the Department of Energy's $305-million advanced research program. The budget also calls for nearly a 40-percent cut to the department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, even after accounting for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), which recently increased FY2019 spending levels.

At the same time, the budget calls for increases in spending on fossil fuels. Including the BBA, the Department of Energy's budget calls for an extra $281 million on fossil-fuel R&D, $200 million of which would be spent on “clean coal.” (Can coal ever be clean?)

Unlike last year, the Trump administration is no longer proposing the destruction of the popular ENERGY STAR program, which certifies energy-efficient appliances. Instead, it wants to charge companies that seek the labeling, using those “user fees” to make the program financially self-sufficient.

Report: Trump Mulling Major Cuts to Clean Energy Research
January 31, 2018

The Washington Post reports that in its 2019 budget, the Trump administration is seeking to slash Department of Energy funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives by 72 percent.

Congress would likely oppose such steep cuts in any future budget negotiations, but the move further signals the Trump administration's avowed support of fossil-fuel industries.

News of the proposed cuts comes the day after President Trump praised “beautiful clean coal” in his State of the Union address, and several days after Trump announced steep tariffs on imported solar panels. (Find out more about the myth of “clean coal.”)

According to Post reporters Chris Mooney and Steven Mufson, leaked budget documents reportedly show that the administration is seeking to cut funding for the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by more than 70 percent, from an enacted 2017 budget of $2.04 billion to $575.5 million. The Post also reports that the budget suggests staffing cuts, from 680 staffers in 2017 to a proposed 450 in 2019.

“I will not comment on a budget that has not been released. However, I will suggest that anyone who questions this administration’s commitment to an all-of-the-above energy approach simply look at our record,"" Department of Energy spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said in a statement. ""Last year the Energy Department awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to solar and wind energy.

""Though it may not fit into the narrative of the environmental lobby and their pundits, the truth is that Secretary Perry believes that there is a role for all fuels—including renewables—in our energy mix.”

This would not be the first time that the Trump administration has attempted to slash this sort of funding. In its 2018 budget, the Trump administration sought cuts of more than two-thirds for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which Congress rejected.

EPA LOOSENS REGULATIONS ON TOXIC AIR POLLUTION
January 25, 2018

In a brief legal memo, the Trump EPA has dropped “once in, always in” (OIAI), a Clinton-era EPA policy that aimed to lock in reductions of hazardous air pollution from industrial sources.

Industry lawyers and Senate Republicans have long argued that eliminating OIAI will actually provide a stronger incentive for businesses to reduce emissions, since they can now more easily lower emissions and avoid the regulations that major pollution sources must endure.

However, environmental activists and lawyers are concerned with the abrupt change, saying that it may actually increase exposure to hazardous air pollution—especially among vulnerable populations, who live near major industrial polluters more often.

“They’re really going to be killing people,” said Hip-Hop Caucus vice president Mustafa Ali, the former environmental justice head at EPA, in an interview with Earther. “You’re going to have all types of public health problems.”

To see how OIAI worked, imagine a business that emits 11 tons of a given hazardous air pollutant (HAP) per year. Under EPA regulations, facilities that emit more than 10 tons of one HAP, or 25 tons of HAPs in total, are reclassified from area sources to major sources.

By law, major sources must retool their processes to get their emissions down to the lowest levels set by peers within the industry. These benchmarks are called the Maximum Achievable Control Technology, or MACT, standards.

By hewing to MACT standards, let's say the company's HAP emissions go down from 11 tons per year to three tons. According to OIAI, the company would have to abide by MACT standards permanently, locking in eight tons of annual emissions reductions.

Under the new EPA policy, however, the company could do just enough to reduce emissions from 11 tons to nine. By dropping below the 10-ton threshold, the company goes from being a major source to being an area source—thereby jettisoning the MACT requirement.

While going from 11 tons of emissions to nine is technically a reduction, it's actually more pollution relative to what the facility could have achieved by complying with MACT standards. This phenomenon, called “backsliding,” is what OIAI aimed to prevent.

Environmental groups are poised to sue the EPA to block the policy change.

“This is among the most dangerous actions that the Trump EPA has taken yet against public health,” said John Walke, clean air director at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), in a statement. “NRDC will fight this terrible decision to unleash toxic pollutants with every available tool.”

Most of National Parks Advisory Board Resigns in Protest
January 15, 2018

Nine of the 12 members of the National Park System Advisory Board resigned on January 15, the Washington Post reported on January 16, in protest of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's refusal to meet with them.

First chartered by Congress in 1935, the civilian group is required to contain academic experts, experienced park managers, and at least one former elected official from an area adjacent to a national park.

The board advises the National Park System, the National Park Service, and the Secretary of the Interior on a wide range of matters, and it also helps to select national historic landmarks. Its members are unpaid.

""I wasn't voted in, but I realize I represent people beyond myself,"" says Carolyn Finney, a University of Kentucky geographer who had served on the board since 2010. ""When you slam the door in the face of me and the board, you're also slamming the door on a whole lot of other people.""

In a joint letter, Finney and other departing board members expressed frustration at Secretary Zinke's refusal to meet with them.

""For the last year we have stood by waiting for the chance to meet... We understand the complexity of transition but our requests to engage have been ignored, and the matters on which we wanted to brief the new Department team are clearly not part of its agenda,"" wrote Tony Knowles, the board's departing chair and a former Alaska governor, in a resignation letter co-signed by Finney and seven other board members.

""I wish the National Park System and Service well and will always be dedicated to their success,"" Knowles's letter continued. ""However, from all of the events of this past year I have a profound concern that the mission of stewardship, protection, and advancement of our National Parks has been set aside.""

In May, the Washington Post reported that the Interior Department began a sweeping review of more than 200 advisory boards and other entities associated with the department. Around the same time, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt dismissed several members of the agency's Board of Scientific Counselors.

Report: Climate Change Web Sites 'Censored' Under Trump
January 10, 2018

A new report finds that in the first year of the Trump administration, U.S. government websites have been systematically altered to cut mentions of climate change. However, there is no evidence of tampering with climate data.

The report, published by the nonprofit Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI), says that several government agencies—notably the EPA—have removed or reduced their web content about climate change.

Since Trump's inauguration, the group has monitored thousands of government web pages for changes or deletions. In some instances, ""climate change"" is replaced with the vaguer words ""sustainability"" or ""resiliency."" In others, some climate change webpages are taken down entirely.

For instance, the Bureau of Land Management's web page on climate change was taken down between May and November 2017, the report states. The EPA's ""Student's Guide to Global Climate Change"" went offline sometime between February and April 2017.

""While we cannot determine the reasons for these changes from monitoring websites alone, our work reveals shifts in stated priorities and governance and an overall reduction in access to climate change information, particularly at the EPA,"" the group says.

EDGI emphasizes that, so far, it hasn't seen evidence of the removal or deletion of climate data sets, as some scientists and activists had feared.

(Full disclosure: the National Geographic Society has given grants to Data Refuge and the Climate Adaptation Knowledge Exchange, which are archiving U.S. climate data.)

TRUMP INTERIOR DEPARTMENT DECLARES THAT ACCIDENTAL BIRD DEATHS ARE LEGAL
December 22, 2017

Reversing Obama-era policy, the Trump administration has decreed that it will no longer consider the accidental killing of birds—from eagles colliding with wind turbines to ducks zapped on power lines—a violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA).

“It reverses decades of precedent over 20 administrations,” says Sarah Greenberger, the National Audubon Society’s vice president of conservation policy. “It’s a shocking step to break with that kind of tradition, and it’s of great concern.”

The law, which turns a hundred years old in 2018, is among the United States’ oldest and widest-reaching environmental protections. Originally envisioned to save birds from overhunting, the law now safeguards more than 1,025 migratory bird species and their eggs, feathers, and nests. Illegally killing a protected bird can result in a $15,000 fine and up to six months in jail.

The law—which prohibits harming protected species ""at any time, or in any manner""—had been interpreted as forbidding “incidental takes,” the accidental yet foreseeable deaths of birds from industrial activity. But the phrase itself does not appear in the law. Through the years, some U.S. courts had questioned whether the MBTA really does cover incidental takes.

In a memo published on January 10, 2017, Hilary Tompkins—the outgoing solicitor for the Obama Interior Department—found that all forms of incidental take were prohibited under the MBTA. In her memo, she cites the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s longtime interpretation of the law and decades of successful prosecutions.

Tompkins also notes that Canada—the co-signer of the Migratory Bird Treaty of 1916, which sparked the MBTA—interprets it as requiring the prohibition of incidental takes.

But on February 6, the incoming Trump administration rescinded Tompkins’ guidance, pending a review. On December 22, it was replaced entirely by a memo reaching the opposite conclusion, relying in part on some U.S. courts’ skeptical rulings.

The analysis, penned by Daniel Jorjani—one of the Trump Interior Department’s highest-ranking lawyers and a former adviser to the Koch brothers—instead finds that the word “take” describes a willful, deliberate act. What’s more, he says that for industry, the threat of being prosecuted for incidental takes is an undue burden.

“Interpreting the MBTA to apply to incidental or accidental actions hangs the sword of Damocles over a host of otherwise lawful and productive actions,” Jorjani wrote in the new memo.

Conservation groups are outraged by the decision. If the MBTA no longer covers incidental take, some experts fear that industry may not invest in systems that save many birds’ lives, such as covers for oil pits, more widely spaced power lines, or camera systems that slow wind turbines when birds are present.

""The statement made by this administration basically says that the real problem...is poaching birds for feathers for ladies' hats,"" says Defenders of Wildlife vice president Bob Dreher, who served as associate director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under Obama. ""They're turning this thing into an antique.""

Energy companies, in particular, have been regularly penalized for incidental takes. After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, the largest in U.S. history, federal officials used the MBTA to secure $100 million in fines from BP that went toward bird conservation efforts.

One 2014 study found that the spill killed anywhere from 600,000 to 800,000 birds in the Gulf of Mexico, including a third of the northern Gulf’s laughing gull population.

Renewable energy and fossil-fuel groups alike have praised the MBTA reversal. “This commonsense approach ensures that lawful activities are not held hostage to unnecessary threats of criminalization,” the National Ocean Industries Association said in a statement.

“We don’t dispute the need for energy,” says Greenberger. “It just seems so unnecessary to have taken this step.”

News of the reversal comes as National Geographic, the National Audubon Society, and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology kick off the Year of the Bird. The joint effort will explore and celebrate birds, as well as document the threats facing them.

“I think we will celebrate, but we also intend to use this partnership to remind people how much of a part of our lives birds are—and what it takes to protect them,” says Greenberger.

This entry has been updated to include comment from Bob Dreher.

Trump Drops Climate Change From List of National Security Threats
December 18, 2017

President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will no longer regard climate change by name as a national security threat.

The stance marks an abrupt turn from the Obama administration, which in 2015 described climate change as “an urgent and growing threat to our national security,” given its effects on natural disasters, conflicts over food and water, and refugee crises.

In contrast, the Trump administration’s national security strategy, published Monday, discusses climate change only within the context of U.S. energy policy.

“Climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system, [and] U.S. leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests,” the report reads. “Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty.”

As National Geographic has previously reported, humans’ dramatic alteration of the global climate is not only scientific fact, but it also poses numerous security threats to the United States and the world.

Depending on the region, extreme weather events—such as droughts, wildfires, heatwaves, and torrential rains—may become more frequent and intense under climate change, posing threats to military installations and civilian communities alike. As weather patterns change, some disease-bearing creatures such as mosquitoes will enjoy longer active seasons over wider areas, exacerbating threats to public health.

In addition, rising seas threaten to cripple coastal military infrastructure, an ongoing concern at the U.S. Navy’s installation in Norfolk, Virginia. Melting ice means that the normally ice-clogged Arctic is poised to transform into a major shipping route, altering regional geopolitics. Warmer, more acidic waters will kill off many coral reefs, which supply food and income to millions. And as sea levels rise, flooding will displace coastal populations.

“We’ve seen that 700,000 refugees coming from Syria have shaken the European Union to its core. Take that number and multiply it by 100 who would be forced to leave the coasts, and that’s the kind of change we are going to unleash upon ourselves,” said David Titley, a climate scientist at Penn State University and retired U.S. Navy rear admiral, in a previous interview.

“The impacts of that on security or economics are fundamentally unknowable,” he added. “But anybody who thinks that’s not a huge risk is probably smoking something.”

Despite Trump’s change in emphasis, it’s possible that U.S. government research on climate change will continue—under an assumed name. Since Trump’s inauguration, U.S. government websites seeking to scrub “climate change” from their records have opted to swap out the phrase for the word “resilience.”

For instance, a division within the Department of Defense’s environmental research programs that had been named for climate change is now named for “resiliency.” An EPA web page devoted to “climate ready” water management now discusses “resilient water utilities.”

What does President Trump’s national security strategy say about “resilience,” then?

“Resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover rapidly from deliberate attacks, accidents, natural disasters, as well as unconventional stresses, shocks, and threats to our economy and democratic system,” the report states. “Through risk-informed investments, we will build resilient communities and infrastructure to protect and benefit future generations.”

Trump Unveils Plan to Dramatically Downsize Two National Monuments
December 4, 2017

In a speech delivered in Salt Lake City, President Trump announced his intention to sharply reduce two Utah national monuments established by his predecessors.

In a move presaged by leaked government documents, Trump announced that he would reduce the 1.35-million acre Bears Ears National Monument, created by President Barack Obama in late 2016, by 85 percent. The president also said he would cut the 1.88-million acre Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, designated by President Bill Clinton in 1996, nearly in half.

Indian nations, conservation groups, and paleontologists have filed suit over the expected changes, among the most sweeping efforts taken by a U.S. president to downsize national monuments.

Interior Department Proposes Largest-Ever Oil and Gas Lease Auction
October 23, 2017

The U.S. Department of Interior has proposed auctioning off oil and gas leases for 77 million acres of federal waters within the Gulf of Mexico—the largest lease auction of its kind ever announced.

In an October 23 statement, the Interior Department says that it will auction off the oil and gas leases for all available unleased areas on the Gulf of Mexico’s outer continental shelf, in waters off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The auction is about a million acres larger than the most recent auction of its ilk, which occurred under the Obama administration in August 2016.

“In today’s low-price energy environment, providing the offshore industry access to the maximum amount of opportunities possible is part of our strategy to spur local and regional economic dynamism and job creation and a pillar of President Trump’s plan to make the United States energy dominant,” said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in a statement.

The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimates that the Gulf of Mexico’s outer continental shelf contains over 48 billion barrels of oil and 141 trillion cubic feet of gas that are technically recoverable. EPA estimates suggest that if these fossil fuels were burned completely, they would add the equivalent of more than 28 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere—more than five times the United States’ total carbon footprint in 2016.

The announcement comes days after an oil pipeline off the coast of Louisiana spilled some 672,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, the largest oil leak in the Gulf since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, which was more than 300 times bigger. Forecasters say that the oil, which dispersed under 5,000 feet of water, is not expected to impact the shoreline, according to an ABC report.

Trump EPA Poised to Scrap Clean Power Plan
October 9, 2017

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is poised to withdraw the Clean Power Plan, the lynchpin of the Obama Administration's effort to combat climate change, the New York Times reported Monday.

In a speech delivered in Hazard, Kentucky, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt declared that he will sign a proposal on Tuesday that would eliminate the Clean Power Plan (CPP), claiming that “the war on coal is over.”

Unveiled in 2015, the Clean Power Plan mandated that the U.S. power sector's carbon emissions be cut by 32 percent from 2005 by 2030 (870 million tons of CO2), slashing the single biggest contributor to the country's overall carbon footprint.

Utility companies and 27 states sued the EPA over the rule, arguing that because the CPP encouraged a broader shift away from coal-fired power plants, the EPA had overstepped its authority under the Clean Air Act. The rule remained in legal limbo as a result.

President Trump campaigned on repealing the CPP, decrying it as an unfair burden on the coal industry and overall economy. EPA Administrator Pruitt, a longtime ally of fossil-fuel interests, advocated for the CPP's repeal when he was Oklahoma's attorney general.

A new report by the Rhodium Group, a policy research firm, finds that the U.S. power sector is now on track to reduce its 2030 emissions by 27 to 35 percent relative to 2005, in line with the CPP's initial goal. However, as the New York Times noted, that same report finds that the CPP would have required up to 21 states to cut their emissions more deeply than existing regulations call for. As a result, the CPP likely would have reduced U.S. power-sector emissions even further.

Beyond the potential climate hazards, experts and advocates have criticized the CPP's repeal on public health grounds. Not only do coal-fired power plants emit carbon dioxide, but they also emit sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter—all potent respiratory irritants. The Obama Administration's EPA had estimated that the CPP would bring up to $54 billion in climate and public health benefits, avoiding 1,500 to 3,600 premature deaths and 90,000 asthma attacks in children.

The EPA under Trump has taken a different tack. In a leaked draft obtained by POLITICO, the cost-benefit analysis for repealing the CPP at times assumes that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards pose no health hazard. There is little scientific evidence to support this claim, says George Thurston, an expert on air pollutants' health risks at the New York University School of Medicine.

“It's just as specious as saying people are at absolutely no risk of a car accident below the legal speed limit,” Thurston said in a teleconference organized by the American Lung Association.

Mining Health Study Halted; Climate Advisory Panel Disbanded
August 22, 2017

The Trump administration has suspended a study of health risks to residents who live near mountaintop removal coal mine sites in the Appalachian Mountains. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine was asked by the Interior Department’s Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement in an August 18 letter to “cease all activities” involved in the two-year, $1 million research project while the department undertakes a review of projects costing more than $100,000. The review was prompted by “the department’s changing budget situation,” the letter said.

The academies undertook the study last year at the request of West Virginia’s state government, after researchers at the University of West Virginia and other institutions found increased risks of birth defects, cancer, and premature death, according to reporting by Ken Ward, Jr. of the Charleston, West Virginia Gazette-Mail.

President Trump proposed cutting $1.6 billion—or 12 percent—from the Interior budget in 2018. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told a Senate committee in June that he supports the budget cuts, which includes cutting 4,000 jobs. “This is what a balanced budget looks like,” he said.

The academies went ahead with previously planned meetings in Hazard and Lexington, Kentucky communities to hear from coal country residents.

“The National Academies believes this is an important study and we stand ready to resume it as soon as the Department of Interior review is completed,” William Kearney, the academies executive director said in a statement. The academies are private, nonprofit institutions that conduct independent analysis and provide advice on complex public policy issues related to science, technology, and medicine, the statement says. They operate under an 1863 congressional charter signed by President Lincoln.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration also disbanded a federal advisory panel for the National Climate Assessment. The 15-member group was created in 2015 to help businesses and state and local governments understand and prepare for the government’s next National Climate Assessment. That report, required by law to be issued every four years, is due in 2018. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokeswoman said the disbanding of the advisory panel, whose charter expired August 20, will not affect completion of the National Climate Assessment.

TRUMP REVOKES FLOOD STANDARDS ACCOUNTING FOR SEA-LEVEL RISE
August 15, 2017

President Trump has signed an executive order revoking federal flood-risk standards that incorporated rising sea levels predicted by climate science.

Trump’s new executive order claims to improve federal infrastructure decisions by quickening and streamlining the environmental review process. A single sentence takes the additional step of revoking Executive Order 13690, signed by President Barack Obama on January 30, 2015.

That executive order required that federally funded projects hew to a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, to reduce the risk of future flood damage. Specifically, the order required that floodplains had to be based on the “best-available, actionable hydrologic and hydraulic data and methods that integrate current and future changes in flooding based on climate science.”

From 1993 to 2016, global average sea level has increased by about 3.25 inches and is projected to rise one to four feet by the end of the century. Higher sea-level rise cannot be ruled out, due to incomplete data on Antarctic ice-shelf stability. Since the 1960s, tidal flooding has increased at least fivefold in several U.S. cities.

U.S. cities are predicted to see more floods in the coming years. A recent Union of Concerned Scientists report found that chronic flooding—a flood roughly every two weeks—will come to affect more than 170 U.S. coastal communities in less than 20 years and some 670 communities by 2100.

REPORT: EPA ENFORCEMENT LAGS UNDER TRUMP
August 10, 2017

A newly published report asserts that in its first six months, the EPA under the Trump administration is off to a slow start enforcing environmental laws.

The report, published by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project, examined lawsuits filed by the EPA from January 20 to July 31, 2017, roughly the Trump administration’s first six months in power. Over that time, the EPA has filed fewer lawsuits against companies for breaking pollution control laws than the agency had during the opening months of the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations.

The Trump EPA also lags by other key metrics, the report finds. So far, its actions against violators have avoided 22 estimated premature deaths, and it has collected $12 million of civil penalties. In comparison, the Obama administration had avoided some 229 premature deaths and collected $36 million in penalties—and in its first six months, the EPA under George W. Bush had avoided some 618 premature deaths and had collected $30 million in penalties.

“This is the weakest start any of us has seen in at least 24 years,” says Eric Schaeffer, the executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and the EPA’s former director of civil enforcement.

In a press call, Schaeffer and the report’s other coauthors expressed concern that the Trump EPA will not make enforcement a priority—a fear they say is only reinforced by proposed budget cuts. The Trump administration has called for a 23-percent cut to the agency’s enforcement budget and an agency-wide budget cut of 31 percent.

In a statement, EPA deputy assistant administrator Patrick Traylor emphasized that the report’s short time window can’t account for the months to years it can take to police possible violators.

“This ‘snapshot’ assertions (sic) say much more about enforcement actions commenced in the later years of the Obama administration than it does about actions taken in the beginning of the Trump administration,” he adds. “Despite this unfair report, EPA is committed to enforcing environmental laws to correct noncompliance and promote cleanup of contaminated sites.”

Interior Department Relaxes Aspects of Sage Grouse Protection
August 7, 2017

The Department of the Interior has released the results of a 60-day review of the Obama administration’s conservation plan to protect the greater sage grouse. The review, ordered in June by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, was intended to determine if that plan interferes with Trump administration efforts to increase energy production on federal lands.

In light of the newly published review, Secretary Zinke recommends reprioritizing oil development within the broader 2015 plan, among other changes. Environmental groups have rebuked the overhaul, arguing that changes to the 2015 plan could dilute protections for the species.

“Today, the administration’s review opens the door to significant changes to the sage-grouse plans, which could undercut the sound science used to develop those plans and jeopardize what we know the bird needs to live and thrive,” said Eric Holst, the associate vice president of working lands for the Environmental Defense Fund, in a statement. “By reopening the federal plans, we risk undermining and undoing one of the greatest collaborative conservation efforts in our nation’s history.”

The Obama plan was drawn up as an alternative to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decision to list the sage grouse for protection under the Endangered Species Act. The approach, which involved a five-year negotiation between 1,100 ranchers, environmental groups, and state and federal agencies, was hailed as an unprecedented collaboration that had reduced the threat to sage grouse habitat while avoiding a more stringent regulatory intervention that might hinder economic development. Fish and Wildlife declined to list the sage grouse after the collaborative conservation plan was unveiled in 2015.

The sage grouse habitat spans 173 million acres in 11 western states, including the Dakotas, and three Canadian provinces. Before the West was settled, the sage grouse once roamed over 290 million acres. In launching the 60-day review, Zinke said: “While the federal government has a responsibility under the Endangered Species Act to responsibly manage wildlife, destroying local communities and levying onerous regulations on the public lands that they rely on is no way to be a good neighbor.” Rewriting the Obama plan could extend beyond President Trump’s term, when public comment periods, new proposals and legal challenges are taken into account.

EPA DROPS DELAY OF OBAMA-ERA OZONE STANDARDS
August 2, 2017

In an about-face spurred by a 16-state lawsuit, the Trump administration EPA has dropped its decision to delay Obama-era regulations on ozone. The potent lung irritant forms when strong sunlight irradiates emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources.

In October 2015, the Obama administration tightened the ozone national standard from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion, citing ozone’s toll on public health. The Obama administration estimated that the reduction would yield $2.9 to $5.9 billion worth of health benefits in 2025, outweighing its estimated annual cost of $1.4 billion.

Few were entirely thrilled with the 2015 regulations. Environmental and public-health groups criticized the regulation as not stringent enough, citing evidence that ozone still poses a public health threat at 70 parts per billion, the upper end of the ozone standards recommended by scientists advising the EPA. Meanwhile, industry groups and their allies in Congress criticized the rule for the costs it would inflict.

In June, the EPA announced its intent to delay the implementation of the rule from October 1, 2017, to October 1, 2018, citing lingering questions and the regulation’s complexities. In response, 16 Democratic state attorneys general and the District of Columbia petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the one-year delay.

In its reversal the next day, the EPA cited its “commitment to working with the states.”

NOAA CANCELS RULE TO PROTECT WHALES FROM FISHING NETS
June 13, 2017

The Trump Administration this week cancelled a rule that would have helped prevent endangered whales and sea turtles from becoming entangled in fishing nets off the U.S. West Coast. Proposed in 2015, the rule would have closed the swordfish gill net fishery for up to two years if any two individual endangered whales or sea turtles were killed or seriously hurt within a two-year period. The same penalties would have applied if any combination of four bottlenose dolphins or short-finned pilot whales were injured or killed within a two-year period.

This week, however, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s fisheries division announced that the rule is no longer necessary because other protections have reduced the number of marine mammals entangled in gill nets. “What changed is that our more detailed analysis demonstrated to us that the hard caps would likely impose significant additional cost on the fleet without much additional conservation benefit,” says Michael Milstein, a NOAA fisheries spokesman.

Entanglements were common in the 1990s. But only two gray whales have been killed or seriously injured since 2012, according to NOAA. The short-beaked dolphin is the most frequently entangled marine mammal, and the number of annual entanglements of this species has declined from 200 killed in the early 1990s to fewer than 10 injured or killed in 2015.

New net design has helped reduce casualties, NOAA says. But environmentalists say that a more likely explanation for the reduced entanglements is the significant drop in the number of fishermen working the waters. The swordfish fleet has declined by almost 90 percent since the 1990s—from 141 boats in 1990 to just 20 boats in 2016. Leatherback turtles, humpback whales, and sperm whales are still being killed in gill nets, a spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity told the Los Angeles Times.

Interior Suggests Shrinking Bears Ears
June 12, 2017

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended that Bears Ears National Monument in southern Utah’s red rock country be shrunk by President Trump. Zinke declined to say at a press conference how much Bears Ears’ boundaries should be downsized. But he suggested the rich cache of ancient tribal artifacts inside the monument—one of the largest collections in the nation—could be protected in a much smaller area surrounding the Bears Ears twin butte formation and another section to the north of what is now a 1.3-million-acre expanse.

The boundary details will be forwarded to Trump later this summer, Zinke said, along with his review of 26 other national monuments. Zinke says legislation will also be proposed so that Congress determines how areas inside national monuments are managed. Bears Ears, for example, also contains wilderness areas inside its boundaries.

The president had asked Zinke in April to review large monuments as part of an effort to increase development on federal lands. Bears Ears is one of two controversial Utah national monuments that drew the ire of Utah lawmakers, who asked Trump to consider rescinding or shrinking them. Bears Ears, created by President Barack Obama last December after several years of negotiations with state and tribal leaders, was singled out by Trump as a “massive federal land grab.” The other is Grand Staircase Escalante, created by President Clinton in 1996, with little public involvement.

Zinke said the Utah delegation and state lawmakers, including Gov. Gary Herbert, support his recommendations. But supporters of Bears Ears existing boundaries expressed disappointment as well as doubts that Trump’s efforts to shrink Bears Ears would survive a court challenge. Randi Spivak, spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group based in Tucson, Arizona, said the recommendation to downsize Bears Ears contradicts the intentions of the Antiquities Act, which enables presidents to set aside federal land for protection and signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. “It’s time for Zinke to stop pretending he’s a Teddy Roosevelt kind of guy,” Spivak said.

Interior to Review Greater Sage Grouse Protection
June 8, 2017

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Wednesday ordered a review of an Obama administration conservation plan to protect the greater sage grouse to determine if that plan interferes with Trump administration efforts to increase energy production on federal lands. The Obama plan was drawn up as an alternative to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decision to list the sage grouse for protection under the Endangered Species Act. The approach, which involved a five-year negotiation between 1,100 ranchers, environmental groups, and state and federal agencies, was hailed as an unprecedented collaboration that had reduced the threat to sage grouse habitat while avoiding a more stringent regulatory intervention that might hinder economic development. Fish and Wildlife declined to list the sage grouse after the collaborative conservation plan was unveiled in 2015.

The sage grouse habitat spans 173 million acres in 11 western states, including the Dakotas, and three Canadian provinces. Before the West was settled, the sage grouse once roamed over 290 million acres. In launching the 60-day review, Zinke said: “While the federal government has a responsibility under the Endangered Species Act to responsibly manage wildlife, destroying local communities and levying onerous regulations on the public lands that they rely on is no way to be a good neighbor.” Rewriting the Obama plan could extend beyond President Trump’s term, when public comment periods, new proposals and legal challenges are taken into account.

U.S. Pulls Out of Paris Climate Agreement
June 1, 2017

President Trump said that he will pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, steering away from a group of 194 other countries that have promised to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The news came just days after he attended the G7 Summit in Italy, where the six other member countries—Germany, Italy, Canada, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom—reaffirmed their commitment to the 2015 climate pact.

As part of the accord, the U.S. had agreed to cut its emissions between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. In abandoning that promise, the U.S. effectively cedes leadership on the issue to other countries, including the world’s top emitter, China. Chinese President Xi Jinping has stood by the agreement in the face of a wavering U.S., calling it a “hard-won achievement” that should be honored. Still, plummeting prices for wind and solar energy and corporations’ support of clean energy are among the reasons why climate progress will likely continue.

Trump Budget Proposes Steep Cuts for the Environment
May 23, 2017

President Trump’s 2018 budget, sent to Congress Tuesday, calls for massive cuts in scientific research and in a slew of environmental programs that protect air and water. The proposed budget, titled “A New Foundation for American Greatness,” slashes the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by 31 percent – a steeper cut than any other agency. Those cuts could translate into a $2.7 billion spending reduction and the loss of 3,200 jobs, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute. The proposed budget eliminates major programs to restore the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, and Puget Sound. It ends the EPA’s lead-risk reduction and radon detection programs and cuts funding for the Superfund cleanup program.

The budget proposal does, however, retain funding for grants and financing to states and cities for drinking water and wastewater programs. S. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, told the Washington Post that he “was amazed” that the final EPA budget is nearly identical to the preliminary budget released in March, despite strong opposition at the time from many members of Congress. In addition, the Interior Department would undergo a 12 percent funding cut, and the Energy Department a six percent cut.

Obama Methane Rule Remains Law of Land
May 10, 2017

In a surprise 51-49 defeat, the U.S. Senate rejects a measure that would have repealed Obama-era regulations on methane emissions. That regulation, which the House of Representatives voted to rescind on February 3, limits the venting and flaring of natural gas from oil and gas facilities on U.S. Bureau of Land Management lands. The Obama administration had argued that the practices wasted tens of billions of cubic feet of natural gas annually—and also posed a climate threat. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with 25 times the warming capacity of carbon dioxide.

EPA Dismisses Science Advisors
May 5, 2017

The EPA dismisses several members of the Board of Scientific Counselors, an 18-member advisory board that reviews the research of EPA scientists. Some of the dismissed scientists had been assured that their three-year terms on the board would be renewed. In a May 7 story by the New York Times, critics assailed the move, casting it as a gift to business interests at the expense of science. An EPA spokesperson said the decision allowed the agency to consider a more diverse pool of applicants, including industry representatives, for the board.

In addition, the Washington Post reported on May 8 that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has started reviewing more than 200 advisory boards and other entities associated with the Interior Department.

EPA Scrubs Climate Change Website
April 28, 2017

The EPA announces that it is reviewing its web content related to climate change. An immediate casualty of the review: the agency’s longtime website devoted to explaining climate change. (The new page, which says it’s being updated “to reflect EPA’s priorities under the leadership of President Trump and Administrator Pruitt,” prominently links to an archived version of the page.) On May 2, 2017, the EPA also purged the Spanish-language version of its climate change web page.

Order Aims to Expand Offshore Drilling
April 28, 2017

President Trump signs an executive order that orders a review of Obama-era bans on offshore oil and gas drilling in parts of the Arctic, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. The Obama policies under review include a five-year oil leasing roadmap that excluded Alaska’s Beaufort and Chukchi Seas and a December 2016 attempt to permanently ban drilling on wide swaths of Arctic and Atlantic waters. NPR reports that the order also halts the designation or expansion of National Marine Sanctuaries, unless the move includes an Interior Department estimate of the area’s “energy or mineral resource potential.” Conservation groups immediately announce their intent to defend Obama’s December 2016 effort in court.

Trump Inner Circle Discusses Paris Agreement
April 27, 2017

Key Trump advisers and Cabinet officials meet to discuss whether the U.S. should stay in the Paris Agreement, according to an April 27 Bloomberg Politics report. The global climate pact was absent from Trump’s March 28 executive order on climate, and debate over whether the U.S. should leave the agreement has divided the White House. Bloomberg Politics and Politico report that Trump is expected to make a final decision on the global climate pact by late May.

Trump Orders Review of National Monuments
April 26, 2017

In a sweeping executive order with few precedents, Trump instructs Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to review as many as 40 national monuments created since 1996 to determine if any of Trump’s three predecessors exceeded their authority when protecting large tracts of already-public land under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The review targets monuments that are at least 100,000 acres in size and reaches back to Utah’s 1.7-million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, which President Bill Clinton created in 1996 in the face of intense opposition. (Read more about the executive order’s potential repercussions.)

Scientists March on Washington
April 22, 2017

On a drizzly Earth Day, thousands of scientists and science enthusiasts march through Washington, D.C., to the U.S. Capitol, voicing support for science’s role in society. The sign-toting crowds—many wearing lab coats and crocheted hats resembling brains—also protest the Trump administration’s environmental and science policies. Satellite events of the March for Science held around the world, more than 600 in all, draw tens of thousands more attendees.

Interior Department Scrubs Climate Change Website
April 19, 2017

An Interior Department official updates the department’s climate change website, deleting much of its content in the process, Motherboard reports. The page now carries a sole mention of “climate change”—and does not explain what the phenomenon is, how it affects the U.S., and what the department is doing about it. (The Interior Department has eight regional Climate Science Centers, which work under the direction of the U.S. Geological Survey “to help resource managers cope with a changing climate,” according to the archived web page.)

Pruitt Calls for Exiting Paris Agreement
April 14, 2017

In an interview on “Fox & Friends,” EPA administrator Scott Pruitt says that he’s personally opposed to the Paris Agreement, the international pact to fight climate change negotiated in 2015. While Pruitt calls the pact “a bad deal for America,” the Trump administration has remained noncommittal on withdrawing from the agreement, reports the Washington Post.

EPA Announces “Back-to-Basics” Agenda
April 13, 2017

With Pennsylvania’s Harvey coal mine as his backdrop, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announces a “back-to-basics” agenda for the environmental agency, which he describes as “protecting the environment by engaging with state, local, and tribal partners to create sensible regulations that enhance economic growth.” The agenda includes reviews of the Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the United States rule, two key Obama-era environmental regulations, as well as promises to clear the backlog of new chemicals awaiting EPA approval. (Read the whole agenda here.)

Climate Change Staffers Reassigned
April 7, 2017

News outlets report that several staff members at EPA’s headquarters who specialized in climate change adaptation have been reassigned. However, an EPA official interviewed by The Hill emphasizes that the agency’s regional offices “have always taken the lead on adaptation and will continue to do so.” An EPA official interviewed by National Geographic says that the staff—four employees in all—will continue at the agency’s Office of Policy, bringing their knowledge to a broader set of issues.

Trump Donates to National Parks
April 3, 2017

The White House announces that President Trump has donated the first quarter of his salary ($78,333.32) to the National Park Service. The gift will reportedly chip away at the $100 to $230 million in deferred maintenance backlogs that the nation’s battlefields currently bear. (The National Park Service’s total deferred maintenance backlog is valued at $12 billion.) Trump’s 2018 budget blueprint calls for a $1.5-billion cut to the U.S. Department of the Interior, to which the National Park Service and its $3.4-billion budget belong. Among other things, the 12-percent cut would eliminate funding for unspecified National Heritage Areas—lived-in, cohesive landscapes deemed by Congress to be nationally important. Several National Heritage Areas contain preserved battlefields.

Scientific Integrity Office Reviewing Pruitt
March 31, 2017

In response to inquiries from the Sierra Club, the EPA’s Office of Inspector General refers Scott Pruitt’s March 9 CNBC interview to the agency’s scientific integrity office for review. In that interview, Pruitt had downplayed carbon emissions’ central role in driving Earth’s changing climate—a position at odds with scientific consensus. EPA spokespeople defend Pruitt, claiming that the administrator is within his right to have a differing opinion. As of April 6, 2017, the Office of Inspector General said that the review had no specified timeframe.

EPA Scientist Retires with a Bang
March 31, 2017

Environmental scientist Michael Cox retires from the EPA after more than 25 years with the agency, penning a scorching farewell letter to agency administrator Scott Pruitt. The letter, which garners significant media coverage, lambasts the Trump administration for “working to dismantle EPA and its staff as quickly as possible.”

Pesticide Avoids Total Ban
March 29, 2017

Against the advice of the EPA’s chemical safety experts, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt rejects a decade-old petition asking that the EPA ban all use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos. In 2000, the EPA banned its use in most household settings, but the pesticide is still used on some 40,000 farms, which EPA scientists recommended stop. Research suggests that chlorpyrifos may be associated with brain damage in children and farm workers, even at low exposures—though Dow Chemical, chlorpyrifos’ manufacturer, argues that it is safe when properly used. The U.S. Department of Agriculture welcomes Pruitt’s decision as helpful for U.S. farmers.

Climate Actions Undone
March 28, 2017

President Trump signs an executive order that seeks to dismantle much of the work on climate change enacted by the Obama administration. The order takes steps to downplay the future costs of carbon emissions, walks back tracking of the federal government’s carbon emissions, rescinds a 2016 moratorium on coal leases on federal lands, and strikes down Obama-era executive orders and memoranda aimed at helping the country prepare for climate change's worst impacts, including threats to national security.

Most notably, the executive order begins the process of rescinding the EPA's Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing power plants. (Read more about the order—and how China may take up global leadership on climate change.)

Dakota Access Pipeline Prepared for Use

Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline, notifies a federal court that it has pumped oil into the pipeline laid underneath North Dakota’s Lake Oahe. The pipeline, which aims to connect North Dakota’s shale oil fields with pipeline networks in Illinois, runs near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and through land promised under the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie but later taken away. The pipeline sparked protests over its potential to contaminate water and damage a sacred tribal site—a movement that grew into the largest Native American protest in recent history. (Meet the defiant “water protectors” of Standing Rock.)

Keystone XL Pipeline Approved
March 24, 2017

The Trump administration’s State Department grants a permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The 1,200-mile pipeline would connect Alberta’s oil sands to refineries in Texas. President Obama had rejected the project in late 2015, amid concerns that the pipeline’s economic benefits were hype—and fears that the pipeline would exacerbate future carbon emissions. In 2014, the U.S. State Department found that the project would increase emissions but no more than other transport methods.

U.S. Bumblebee Officially Listed as Endangered
March 21, 2017

The rusty patched bumblebee (Bombus affinis) officially becomes listed as an endangered species, the first bumblebee and eighth U.S. bee species to receive federal protection. Originally, its listing was to be finalized on February 10—but a January 20 executive order delayed it by over a month, as the Trump administration reviewed Obama-era regulations that hadn’t yet taken effect. (Read more about the bumblebee listing.)

Flint Funding Continued
March 17, 2017

The EPA issues a news release saying that the agency has awarded $100 million to Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality. The money—provided in a law signed by President Obama in December 2016—will fund drinking water infrastructure upgrades in Flint, Michigan, where drinking water remains contaminated with lead. (These intimate portraits of Flint’s citizens reveal their frustration, fear, and perseverance.)

Fuel Efficiency Standards Reconsidered
March 15, 2017

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao announce that the EPA will reconsider the Obama-era emissions requirements for vehicles with model years between 2022 and 2025. The move may presage a rollback of Obama’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, regulations that aim to improve cars’ fuel economy. On January 12, 2017, the Obama EPA attempted to lock in its CAFE standards, which require light-duty vehicles to have average fuel efficiencies of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The Trump administration and automakers have argued that this goal is unachievable.

Science and Environment Budget Threatened
March 13, 2017

The White House releases its first preliminary budget under President Trump. Confirming weeks of speculation, the budget outlines deep cuts to U.S. science and environmental agencies—notably EPA and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—and a vast array of social programs, in an effort to increase defense spending by $54 billion. Congressional and public opposition to the budget crystallizes almost immediately. (Read more about the budget cuts’ potential effects on the environment.)

EPA Chief Downplays Climate
March 9, 2017

In a sharp break with scientific consensus, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt says in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that carbon dioxide’s role in the Earth’s changing climate remains unclear. U.S. and international scientists have repeatedly connected rising carbon emissions to the Earth’s changing climate. A 2014 review by the National Academy of Sciences, the United States’ preeminent scientific advisory body, observed that the Earth’s warming since the 1970s “is mainly a result of the increased concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.”

‘Science’ Scrubbed
March 7, 2017

The New Republic reports that the EPA’s Office of Science and Technology removed the word “science” from its mission statement, based on information provided by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. The updated language, which instead emphasizes ""economically and technologically achievable performance standards,"" marks the latest change to the EPA’s website under Trump, as website updates downplay the Obama administration’s previous climate initiatives.

Emissions Info Request Nixed
March 2, 2017

The EPA withdraws an Obama EPA request for more detailed information on oil and natural-gas facilities. That request, finalized by the Obama administration on November 10, 2016, had aimed to better track the industry’s methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. (Oil and gas facilities are the country’s largest industrial emitters of methane.) The Trump EPA had criticized the rule for its estimated $42-million cost on oil and gas industries.

Federal Lands Won’t Be Unleaded
March 2, 2017

After riding to work on a horse, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke spends his first day on the job rescinding an Obama-era prohibition of lead ammunition on federal lands and waters. The Obama Administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service had issued the ban on January 19, 2017, the day before Trump’s inauguration. The National Rifle Association and hunting groups laud Zinke’s move as supportive of hunting’s economic contribution, while conservation groups decry it, noting that lead ammunition can poison wildlife. (Learn how a ban on lead ammunition could save California’s rare condors.)

Water Protection May Dry Up
February 28, 2017

President Trump issues an executive order formally asking the EPA to review the “Waters of the United States” rule, an Obama-era rule meant to clarify which U.S. waters fall under federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction. The rule had extended federal protections to some headwaters of larger waterways, wetlands, and isolated lakes. (Read more about the controversy surrounding the rule.)

Scott Pruitt Confirmed as EPA Chief
February 17, 2017

The U.S. Senate confirms Scott Pruitt as the head of the U.S. EPA. In his prior role as Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt frequently sued the EPA over its regulations, notably leading a 27-state lawsuit against the Clean Power Plan. Emails released days after Pruitt’s confirmation show that in his time as Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt’s office maintained a cozy relationship with oil and gas companies.

Streams Reopened to Mining Waste
February 16, 2017

President Trump signs a joint resolution passed by Congress revoking the U.S. Department of the Interior’s “Stream Protection Rule.” That rule, finalized shortly before President Obama left office, placed stricter restrictions on dumping mining waste into surrounding waterways. Congressional Republicans characterized the rule as redundant and onerous. (Read “Why Trump Can’t Make Coal Great Again.”)

Fossil Fuel CEO Becomes Chief Diplomat
February 1, 2017

The U.S. Senate confirms ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Tillerson’s extensive ties to fossil fuels—and difficult-to-pin-down stance on climate science—sparked fierce opposition to his nomination among environmentalists. Questions linger over what Tillerson and the Trump administration will do about U.S. involvement in the Paris Agreement, the international climate pact negotiated under the Obama administration.

March for Science Materializes
January 25, 2017

After news that the Trump administration had removed all references to climate change from the White House’s website, online commenters begin calling for a “Scientists’ March on Washington,” styled after the record-breaking Women’s March on January 21. Momentum quickly builds, resulting in plans for the March for Science, scheduled for April 22.

Pipelines Greenlit
January 24, 2017

President Trump issues several memoranda aiming to hasten permitting for the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. Trump also calls for the U.S. Department of Commerce to come up with a plan ensuring that pipelines built across the United States are made with U.S. steel. However, later reports clarify that the memo does not apply to the Keystone XL pipeline.

Park Service #Resists
January 20, 2017

Trump is inaugurated president. Minutes later, the National Park Service posts a photo on Twitter comparing Trump’s crowds with the much larger crowds at Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration. Trump’s subsequent criticism of the National Park Service triggers an unofficial “resistance” movement of social media accounts that claim to be run by U.S. government officials. (Read more about the “science rebellion” blossoming under Trump.)

Scramble to Save Science Data
December 10, 2016

Fearing that the incoming Trump administration may attempt to delete or bury U.S. climate databases, meteorologist and climate journalist Eric Holthaus asks on Twitter for suggestions of important databases to back up. His query sparks a movement across academia to back up key databases, resulting in “data refuges” and the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative.

Trump Takes All
November 8, 2016

Real estate developer Donald Trump wins the 2016 U.S. presidential election. His upset victory comes after a months-long campaign that focused little on environmental issues, but did denounce the Obama administration’s climate policies and champion the U.S. fossil fuels industry. In 2017, the arrival of the Trump Administration brought a flurry of changes to U.S. environmental policy—from the decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement to cutting federal funding for science and the environment initiatives. To keep track of it all, National Geographic kept a running list, below, of these developments for the first two years of the administration. Now, with campaign season in full swing, we’re keeping track of environmental actions and promises from both the Trump Administration and Democratic presidential nominee Joseph Biden. Follow along here.

Offshore drilling safety rules rolled back
May 2, 2019

The Trump administration announced that they will roll back some safety measures that regulate offshore drilling operations.

The previous set of safety rules were implemented in 2010, after a disastrous explosion at a BP oil well in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 people and spilled over 200 million gallons of oil into the sea. Oil from the disaster marred the nearby coasts and deep seas for years afterward.

After the explosion, the Obama administration tightened safety rules for offshore drilling operations. Amongst other measures, they required more tests on “blowout preventers” and other parts of the drilling apparatuses and required safety checks from independent investigators. The new rollbacks reduce or rescind these safety measures.

The rollbacks were welcomed by leaders in the oil and gas industry and criticized by many environmental groups.

Bernhardt confirmed as interior secretary
April 11, 2019

The U.S. Senate confirmed David Bernhardt as secretary of the interior on a 56-41 vote. It's a post he has held on an acting basis since previous office holder Ryan Zinke resigned earlier in the year amid allegations of ethics misconduct.

Democrats had criticized Bernhardt's nomination in part because of his long history as a lobbyist for the energy and agribusiness sectors. Environmentalists have expressed concern that he will continue working to expand extraction operations on public lands and roll back protections. Democrats have called for an investigation of Bernhardt's pass conduct.

“David Bernhardt spent years in the private sector advancing policy goals of special interests who profit off our public lands. Despite his clear conflicts, Zinke put him in charge of ripping apart the plans just to help those very industries that Bernhardt used to work for,” Jayson O’Neill, deputy director of the Western Values Project, a Montana-based nonprofit focused on public lands protections, said in a previous statement.

Trump signs pipeline orders
April 9, 2019

President Trump signed two executive orders that will smooth the path for companies to build oil and gas pipelines and limit the tools states have to block them.

The Trump administration, as part of their ""Energy Dominance"" initiative, has consistently sought to streamline the domestic energy production process. These two executive orders follow in that pattern.

The first order directs the EPA to reconsider a part of the Clean Water Act. ""Section 401"" of the Act requires any oil or gas project that could potentially contaminate waters regulated under the act to receive state-level certifications and approvals. In the past, states have occasionally denied those certifications, preventing pipelines and other infrastructure from being built. If the EPA re-evaluates this section of the act, companies would be able to sidestep the state certification process, streamlining the pathway to construction.

The second order asserts that the president has the authority to “issue, deny, or amend” any permits for pipelines or other infrastructure projects that cross international borders. Previously, that authority lay with the secretary of state. Most notably, this decision would apply to permitting decisions concerning TransCanada Corporation's controversial Keystone XL pipeline, a project that, if completed, could carry some 800,000 barrels of oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast each day.


Trump Greenlights Keystone XL Pipeline
March 29, 2019

President Donald Trump issued a new permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, which he had previously approved two years ago, after the Obama administration had delayed it. The pipeline would carry crude oil from the tar sands of western Canada to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Trump's previous approval had been blocked by a federal judge in Montana in November, who had said the government had not done enough to complete environmental reviews of the controversial project.

In response to the new order, a White House spokesperson told the Associated Press, “Specifically, this permit reinforces, as should have been clear all along, that the presidential permit is indeed an exercise of presidential authority that is not subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.”

Stephan Volker, a lawyer representing environmentalists opposed to the pipeline, told the AP he would be suing to block construction. “President Trump has launched a direct assault on our system of governance,” Volker said.

Oil and gas companies get access to sage grouse habitat
March 15, 2019

The sage grouse, an odd-looking western bird that has become a symbol of land conflict between environmentalists and energy companies, is again at risk of losing some of its habitat.

On Friday, the Trump administration announced it would be dismantling the 2015 Sage Grouse Conservation Plans, which had been negotiated by many stakeholders from industry to conservation groups. The new directive, led by acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, now gives states more control over which habitats they can open for fossil fuel extraction. Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, and parts of California will be impacted, and the National Wildlife Federation cites eight million acres of sage grouse territory that will be potentially at risk.

Those in favor of the change are saying it will give states more flexibility over their own territories and was praised by Utah Governor Gary Herbert.

Conservationists fear the regulatory rollback will push the species toward endangerment. Once numbering as many as 16 million, only about 500,000 are thought to exist today. The National Wildlife Federation classifies the bird as an indicator species, meaning when sage grouse populations are declining, the surrounding ecosystem is likely declining.


Trump signs bill protecting millions of acres of public lands
March 12, 2019

President Donald Trump signed a bill that provides protections to over two million acres of lands across the United States. The massive package was well-received by environmental groups, hunting and angling groups, and lawmakers from both parties; before Trump signed, it had easily passed in both the House and the Senate.

The package touches nearly every state, designating 1.3 million new acres of wilderness lands across several western states; creating new national monuments in Mississippi and Kentucky; and protecting hundreds of miles of rivers under the Wild and Scenic Rivers program. In addition, the bill guarantees authorization for the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund, a program that uses revenues from offshore oil and gas drilling to fund public lands and conservation efforts nationwide. (Read more about the law.)

 

Andrew Wheeler confirmed as EPA administrator
February 28, 2019

Since Andrew Wheeler was made acting EPA director in July, he has issued a series of controversial environmental rollbacks. Wheeler is a former coal lobbyist who replaced Scott Pruitt, President Trump's first pick for EPA administrator who resigned last July.

Wheeler's confirmation comes at a time when Congress is deeply divided among party lines over how to approach climate change and the environment, with some Democrats pushing for a “Green New Deal.” Wheeler also faces intense pressure from environmentalists after the Washington Post revealed earlier this month that EPA inspections are at a 10-year low. Inspections are a key tool the agency uses to regulate polluters.

In the months that Wheeler has been in office, he has undone Obama-era regulations on emissions from coal power plants and automobiles. He has also dismissed a scientific review panel that advised the EPA on air pollution regulation and weakened the criminal enforcement arm of the agency.


Executive order calls for sharp logging increase on public lands
January 15, 2019

Earlier this week, the Washington Postrevealed that President Donald Trump quietly issued an executive order to increase logging of forests on federal land on December 21, a day before the government shutdown. The order states that logging will prevent future wildfires like the deadly blazes seen in California last year.

Both the Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture have been instructed to harvest more than 4 billion board feet of timber that will then be put up for sale. That figure is 31 percent more than what the agencies logged in 2017.

Last November, President Trump published a series of tweets blaming poor forest management for the deadly fires that destroyed homes and lives in California. Though it was soon revealed that many of those forests were federally managed, firefighters noted that clearing dry debris was essential to preventing large fires because it removes potential fuel sources.

Speaking with the Washington Post, a fire ecologist from the University of Colorado Boulder said the increased logging might help quell a small percent of the fires that occur near homes but would do little to halt large-scale wildfires. Logging would also do nothing to fight fires fueled by dry brush.

Critics of the president's executive order also say the decision to log does little to address concerns from scientists that wildfires are more frequently being caused by climate change-induced conditions. Logging can also have other negative impacts, including disruption to wildlife habitat and erosion.


EPA criminal enforcements hit 30-year low
January 15, 2019

A report by the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) found the Environmental Protection Agency's criminal prosecutions under the Trump administration have been the lowest they've been in 30 years.

Much of the EPA's authority comes from the agency's ability to prosecute organizations that have violated environmental standards, but the Trump administration has been vocal about scaling back regulations and reducing EPA legal authority.

Only 166 referrals were sent to the Department of Justice during the last fiscal quarter. The EPA hasn't filed such few cases since the Reagan administration. Under the Clinton administration, criminal referrals reached just under 600.

In a press release, PEER attributed the steep decline to the agency's reduced budget for enforcement staff. Before leaving office, former administrator Scott Pruitt reportedly pulled agents from regional offices to staff his large security detail.

Last August, the agency also renamed their National Enforcement Initiative to the National Compliance Initiative. The change brought with it a softer approach to reprimanding polluters. For instance, a company could be allowed to negotiate an agreement to change their actions instead of facing prosecution. Though decried by environmentalists, the EPA says the change will help them tackle a broader scope of violations.

Environmental groups say not enforcing violations is a subtle way for the agency to scale back the EPA without passing large policy changes.


Trump nominates Andrew Wheeler to permanent EPA job
January 9, 2019

Though the federal government remains shut down, President Donald Trump officially nominated Acting Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler to the post on a permanent basis on Wednesday. Wheeler had served in the acting role since July, when former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned after intense media scrutiny and ethics scandals (see below).

Confirmed by the Senate as acting administrator, Wheeler will now need an additional confirmation for the permanent job.

The former coal lobbyist has largely continued Pruitt's legacy in office. In August Wheeler released a proposed rule that would roll back fuel-efficiency and pollution standards for vehicles, as well as limit California's ability to set its own car standards. Wheeler also unveiled a proposed replacement for the Obama-era Clean Power Plan that would let states set their own rules. In December Wheeler rolled out a weakened redo of the Waters of the United States rule, which would limit oversight of a range of activities from farming to industry.

Trump said Wheeler has ""done a fantastic job"" in his acting role.

“For me, there is no greater responsibility than protecting human health and the environment, and I look forward to carrying out this essential task on behalf of the American public,” Wheeler said in a statement upon his nomination.

“Wheeler has advanced the same destructive agenda as Pruitt, but without sideshow antics slowing him down,” Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “If he’s confirmed, Wheeler would surpass Pruitt as the most dangerous EPA administrator of all time. The Senate must not give him the chance.”

Trump Administration Rolls Back Obama-Era Coal Rules
December 6, 2018

The Trump administration rolled back another Obama-era climate rule when it announced Thursday it will lift some restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal power plants.

The change, intended to spur construction of new coal plants, comes as scientists warned world leaders attending the UN’s annual climate conference that the consequences of unchecked global warming will be severe and costly. The meeting opened with a warning from Polish President Andrzej Duda: “We are trying to save the world from annihilation…”

The easing of coal rules was announced by the Environmental Protection Agency’s acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, who said the move would “rescind excessive burdens on America’s energy providers and level the playing field so that new energy technologies can be part of America’s future.”

Proposed changes to the New Source Performance Standards would no longer require that plants meet strict goals of achieving emissions equal to or less than what plants would have achieved with carbon capture and storage technology.

The Obama administration rule, adopted in 2015, restricted carbon dioxide pollution from future power plants and prompted a strong pushback from the coal industry that complained it inhibited new plant construction. Equipment required under the Obama rule was expensive, and criticized by the energy industry as technologically unproven.

The announcement also came the day after the U.S. Energy Information Administration released figures for coal consumption in 2018 that show a four percent decline from 2017 and the lowest level since 1979. The largest consumer of coal is the electric power sector, and the decline reflects the closing of coal plants and competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources. Energy analysts have predicted that coal is unlikely to recover in the energy market it once dominated.

Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, who appeared by Wheeler’s side at the EPA press conference, praised the proposal because it will make it feasible for new plant construction.

Clare Lockwood, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the proposal an “act of flailing, die-hard climate denial.”

Interior Eases Drilling Controls Protecting Sage Grouse
December 6, 2018

The U.S. Interior Department moved forward Thursday with plans to ease restrictions on oil and gas drilling across millions of acres of protected habitat in 11 western states where the imperiled greater sage grouse lives.

Documents released by the Bureau of Land Management show the Trump administration’s intention to open more public lands to lease and allow waivers for drilling in the grouse breeding grounds. The plan is the next step in the administration’s efforts to rework Obama administration protections for the grouse. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke had promised to remove obstacles to drilling. Protections of the ground-dwelling grouse have long been viewed by the energy industry as an obstacle to development.

“I completely believe that these plans are leaning forward on conservation of sage grouse,” Interior Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt told the Associated Press. “Do they do it in exactly the same way, no? We made some change in the plans and got rid of some things that are simply not necessary.”

Conservationists and wildlife advocates vigorously disagreed and warned that drilling could further threaten the birds’ survival. The sage grouse once numbered in the millions. The population is now estimated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service between 200,000 and 500,000.

“David Bernhardt spent years in the private sector advancing policy goals of special interests who profit off our public lands. Despite his clear conflicts, Zinke put him in charge of ripping apart the plans just to help those very industries that Bernhardt used to work for,” Jayson O’Neill, deputy director of the Western Values Project, a Montana-based nonprofit focused on public lands protections, said in a statement.

The administration’s plans would modify protections in seven states, including Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, California, Idaho, and Oregon. The documents released Thursday include environmental analysis of the changes in each state plan. The public can comment on that analysis before a final decision, expected to be announced in early 2019.

NOAA green lights seismic airgun blasts for oil and gas drilling
November 30, 2018

Five oil and gas companies have been given the green light to use seismic airgun blasts to search for lucrative oil and gas deposits that could be buried in the sea floor from New Jersey to Florida.

The proposal was shot down by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in 2017 after it was deemed unsafe for marine life, but a recent review by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) concluded the blasts could be done without significantly threatening the population status of threatened or endangered species. The basis of NOAA's investigation was to determine whether or not the activity would violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

Large marine mammals like whales and dolphin use sound communicating, feeding, and mating, meaning the blasts could impact all three of those essential activities.

Keystone XL Pipeline Blocked by Federal Judge
November 8, 2018

A federal judge in Montana blocked construction from beginning on the Keystone XL pipeline, a 1,200-mile-long project that would deliver 800,000 barrels a day of crude oil from the Alberta, Canada, oil sands to refineries in the U.S. Pipeline operator TransCanada first proposed the pipeline in 2008; the Obama administration rejected its permit application in 2015, citing concerns about the pipeline's impact on climate. Trump reversed that decision shortly after he was inaugurated in 2017. (What is the Keystone XL pipeline?)

Judge Brian Morris wrote that the Trump administration had “simply discarded prior factual findings related to climate change” in order to move the project forward. In so doing it had violated its responsibility under the Administrative Procedures Act to provide a “reasoned explanation” for the changed decision. The Trump administration, Morris wrote, had failed to fully consider the climate, cultural, economic, and environmental impacts of the project—neither incorporating the latest science on climate change nor the impact on indigenous cultural resources in the pipeline's path.


The pipeline has been controversial since it was first proposed, with many environmental groups and indigenous communities strongly opposed to its construction. Construction work had been scheduled to begin in 2019. How long it will now be delayed is uncertain. The administration could appeal the ruling.

Youth Climate Change Lawsuit Delayed
November 8, 2018

The trial in a climate change lawsuit brought by 21 youths has been delayed again, after a federal appeals court granted the Trump administration’s request that it consider halting the case.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday gave the youths’ lawyers 15 days to respond to the government’s petition. In a meeting with lawyers, District Court Judge Ann Aiken indicated she will promptly set a new trial date once the appeals court lifts its temporary stay, according to Meg Ward, a spokeswoman for the youths.

The trial had been set to begin on October 29 in Eugene, but was delayed after the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene and halt it. On November 2, the justices refused and advised the government to return to the Ninth Circuit, which it did on November 5. Trump administration lawyers filed a rarely-used appeal that asks the appellate court to rule on the case before the lower court has heard it at trial.

Supreme Court Refuses to Halt Youths' Climate Change Suit
November 2, 2018

The Supreme Court on Friday refused to halt the trial in a case brought by 21 youths who sued the federal government for its role in causing global warming. The youths, many of whom live in regions already suffering the effects of climate change and extreme weather events, want a federal judge in Oregon to order the government to write a plan to address climate change.

The trial was to have begun October 29 in Eugene, but was delayed after the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intercede and block the case.

In a three-page unsigned order, the justices advised the government to take its arguments back to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and left open the possibility that the government court return to the Supreme Court. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch said they would have granted the administration’s request. The other seven justices did not indicate how they decided the government’s appeal.

The justices noted the government’s description of the case as “based on an assortment of unprecedented legal theories, such as a substantive due process right to certain conditions, and an equal protection right to live in the same climate as enjoyed by prior generations.”

The order was the second time since July the justices denied the government’s effort to stop the case as premature.

Lawyers for the youths announced they would ask that the trial begin next week.

“The youth of our nation won an important decision today from the Supreme Court that shows even the most powerful government in the world must follow the rules and process of litigation in our democracy,” Julia Olson, executive director of Our Children’s Trust and the co-counsel in the lawsuit, said in a statement.

The case of Juliana v. United States was filed in 2015 during the Obama administration. The youths’ suit contends that the federal government pursued energy policies that caused climate change even though it knew for more than a half-century that carbon emissions would destabilize the climate, and the failure to protect future generations from the effects of climate change violated their generations’ constitutional right to live in a “climate system capable of sustaining human life.”

Both the Obama and Trump administration lawyers have argued repeatedly in numerous appeals that the policy-making on climate change does not belong in court, but more properly in the realm of Congress and the federal agencies that write laws and government regulations. The youths “seek nothing less than a complete transformation of the American energy system–including the abandonment of fossil fuels–ordered by a single district court….” Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote in a brief. He added: the “assertion of sweeping new fundamental rights to certain climate conditions has no basis in the nation’s history and tradition–and no place in federal court.”

In response to the government’s appeal, the youths’ lawyers argued that constitutional questions are traditionally addressed after trial, when a record of fact has been established, and not before. As to the potential injury, the lawyers wrote: “When a child suffers climate-induced flooding where the child sleeps, increased incidence of asthma attacks from climate-induced wildfire and smoke conditions in areas where the child exercises, dead coral reefs due to overly warm oceans where the child swims, and storm surges and rising seas perpetually attacking the barrier island where the child lives so that the child now routinely evacuates and experiences flooding in the child’s roads, home and school, those injuries are hardly generalized grievances.”

First offshore oil wells approved for the Arctic
October 24, 2018

After years of heated debate between conservationists and the petroleum industry about risks and rewards, the federally controlled waters of the U.S. Arctic are cleared to see their first oil and gas production wells. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a conditional permit to Houston-based Hilcorp to move forward with its Liberty Project, to begin drilling from an artificial island in the Beaufort Sea.

In announcing the approval, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, “Responsibly developing our resources, in Alaska especially, will allow us to use our energy diplomatically to aid our allies and check our adversaries.”

But environmentalists are concerned that the region's harsh climate, and threatened wildlife, make the project a risky gamble.

“Opening the Arctic to offshore oil drilling is a disaster waiting to happen,” Kristen Monsell, ocean legal director with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “This project sets us down a dangerous path of destroying the Arctic. An oil spill in the Arctic would be impossible to clean up and the region is already stressed by climate change.”

Hilcorp intends to move forward by creating a gravel island in 19 feet of water about 5.6 miles off Alaska's north shore. The island would have a footprint covering 24 acres of seafloor and an area above the surface of about 9 acres. The site lies a few miles east of the massive Prudhoe Bay oil field.

Hilcorp says it hopes to extract 60,000 to 70,000 barrels per day from up to 16 wells on the island, for a total haul of 80 million to 130 million barrels over 15 to 20 years. Oil will be conveyed via an underwater pipeline.

Regulators pointed to safety features in approving the plan, including a promise to only drill into oil-bearing rock when the Arctic is frozen and restrictions on ship traffic.

But environmentalists challenge that any cleanup efforts in the remote north would be exceedingly difficult. Noise and traffic to the island may disturb whales, seals, and other wildlife, Monsell said.

U.S. pushes to end children's climate change suit
October 19, 2018

A week before the start of a trial in a case brought by 21 children who sued the U.S. government for its role in causing climate change, the government is moving aggressively to end the case.

After failing to convince the Supreme Court to end the case in July, the Justice Department returned to the court this week to ask for a second time that the suit be blocked. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, in a new 38-page filing, asked the justices again to intervene and “end this profoundly misguided suit.”

On Friday, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted the case and has given the lawyers for the children until Wednesday to respond.

The youths contend that the U.S. government has pursued energy policies that caused climate change, despite knowing for more than 50 years that carbon emissions would destabilize the climate; they argue the failure to protect future generations from the effects of climate change violate their generation’s constitutional right to a “climate system capable of sustaining human life.”

The trial in the case of Juliana v. United States is scheduled to being Oct. 29 in Eugene, Oregon.

In a statement, Julia Olson, the youth’s co-counsel and executive director of Our Children’s Trust, expressed confidence in a statement that the trial will proceed once the justices receive the youth plaintiffs’ response to the government’s “mischaracterization” of the case.

“As the Supreme Court has recognized in innumerable cases, review of constitutional questions is better done on a full record where evidence is presented and weighed by the trier of fact,” Olson said. “This case is already about recognized fundamental rights and children’s rights of equal protection under the law.”

The government’s new appeal to the Supreme Court came as both sides await a ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the government’s effort to end the case.

“We are now facing a legal case where the district court is considering a matter, the Ninth Circuit is considering the same matter, and the Supreme Court has been asked to consider the matter,” says Phil Gregory, the youth’s co-counsel. “Every legal scholar I’ve talked to says they have never seen this before. It’s unprecedented.”

In July, when the Supreme Court justices declined to intercede, calling it “premature,” they also noted the “breadth” of some of the claims were “striking,” and that there are “substantial grounds for a difference of opinion.” The justices cautioned U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken to “take these concerns into account” when moving toward trial.

On Monday, in a sweeping ruling, Aiken rejected the government’s efforts to limit the case, although granted the government’s request to dismiss President Trump as a defendant. She ordered the case to proceed to trial as scheduled.

In the government’s new filing, Francisco argued that Aiken had failed to follow the high court’s admonishment to “meaningfully narrow” the case. He also harshly criticized the lawsuit, arguing that not only has the case cost “taxpayers millions of dollars” as government lawyers prepare for the court battle, but that the lawsuit itself is merely an “attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process.”

The government also moved this week, in a filing dated Oct. 15, to exclude climate experts from testifying for the plaintiffs because the government does not dispute their conclusions about climate change. That was a day after Trump, in an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, conceded that “something’s happening” to the climate, but added: “I don’t know that it’s man-made.”

President Trump Signs Bill to Clean Up Ocean Plastics
October 12, 2018

President Trump called out other nations, including China and Japan, for “making our oceans into their landfills” when he signed legislation last week to improve efforts to clean up plastic trash from the world’s oceans.

“As president, I will continue to do everything I can to stop other nations from making our oceans into their landfills,” Trump said at a White House signing ceremony. “That’s why I’m please—very pleased, I must say—to put my signature on this important legislation.”

The law, passed with bipartisan support, amends the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Marine Debris Act and funds the program through 2022. The law fosters efforts to clean up plastic trash from the world’s oceans and encourages federal trade negotiators to prod “leaders of nations responsible for the majority of marine debris” to improve management of waste that ends up in the oceans.

Trump agreed with Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, that trade talks with the Philippines should include plastic waste. “We’re okay with that,” he said. “I understand. A lot comes from there.”

Trump also blamed other unnamed countries that “abuse the oceans” and whose trash floats to the West Coast of the United States,” creating, he said, “a very unfair situation.”

“It’s incredible. It’s incredible when you look at it,” Trump said. “People don’t realize it, but all the time we’re being inundated by debris from other countries.”

Comparatively, the beaches of the United States are among the world’s cleanest. Kamilo Beach in Hawaii, which faces the Pacific gyre, where ocean trash collects, is the exception. But most of the world’s plastic trash collects in coastal regions and on beaches in developing nations that lack adequate municipal waste collection systems.

Japan has had for years one of the world’s highest recycling rates and earlier this year, China stopped buying the world’s trash. The United States was one of the top sellers of recycled plastic to China.

EPA to Disband Air Pollution Review Panel
October 11, 2018

The Environmental Protection Agency will not continue a scientific review panel that advises the agency about safe levels of pollution in the air, the New York Times reports.

The 20-member Particulate Matter Review Panel has been made up of scientists who are experts in the health dangers of soot. That panel will no longer meet next year, though the agency declined to disclose why.

Conservation groups have complained that eliminating the panel will make it easier to roll back pollution standards or push through other changes with less regard to the impact on human health.

The agency has said that a seven-member panel will review federal air standards going forward, with the goal of more revisions by 2020. Conservationists have warned that this group currently only includes one independent researcher and may not be robust enough to protect public health.

Ban on Mining Near Yellowstone Extended
October 8, 2018

U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke extended a ban on mining in a 30,000-acre area of his home state near Yellowstone National Park. Known as Paradise Valley, that part of southwestern Montana is popular with outdoor enthusiasts and tourists and is known for pricey second homes. Attractive to mining companies in recent years, the parcel of federal land is managed by the U.S. Forest Service.

Zinke's order extends the ban on all mineral extraction on the federal land for another 20 years, the maximum allowed by law. The previous Interior secretary, Sally Jewel, had enacted a two-year ban while more studies of the area were made. Meanwhile, mining companies had been making some exploratory efforts on nearby private land.

“I fully support multiple use of public lands, but multiple use is about balance and knowing that not all areas are right for all uses. There are places where it is appropriate to mine and places where it is not. Paradise Valley is one of the areas it's not,” Zinke said when extending the ban, as reported by The Hill.

The ban was supported by Montana's entire delegation to Congress—who have also floated a bill to make it permanent—and had strong bipartisan support in the state. It was opposed by the state's mining association.

While praising the move, Aaron Weiss of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities also noted that “Secretary Zinke always seems to support conservation in his home state of Montana, while backing the most aggressive forms of industrial development in the other 49 states.""

Weiss pointed to recent efforts supported by Zinke to expand mining in Bears Ears, Grand Staircase-Escalante, and the Boundary Waters as examples of the latter.

Report: Trump Administration Predicts 7 Degrees of Global Warming by 2100
September 28, 2018

A Washington Post story highlights a startling footnote in a U.S. government agency report: a forecast that global carbon emissions will nearly double by 2100. Trump administration officials are using the dire forecast to support a rollback of Obama-era fuel efficiency standards that would increase U.S. carbon emissions.

The draft report, recently published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), intends to justify the SAFE Vehicles Rule, the Trump administration's proposed changes to fuel efficiency standards for model year 2021-2026 passenger cars and light trucks. Trump officials would prefer to freeze these average fuel economy standards to 37 miles per gallon. The Obama-era policy would have made these standards stricter over time, to an average of 46.7 miles per gallon for model year 2025 vehicles.

According to the NHTSA report, this change would increase these vehicles' carbon emissions by nine percent from 2021 through the end of the century, an upswing of about 7.8 billion tons of CO2. But to minimize this impact, the report emphasizes that the rollback would increase global CO2 levels by “just” 0.65 parts per million—from a baseline of 789.11 parts per million.

It's this baseline estimate that's raising eyebrows. Currently, global CO2 levels are about 410 parts per million, smashing natural CO2 records from the last 800,000 years by a third. The last time CO2 levels were this high, roughly three million years ago, sea levels were 20 feet higher than they are today.

Against this backdrop, setting a 2100 baseline of 789 parts per million is astonishing. For one, this forecast assumes that the Paris Agreement makes no dent in global CO2 levels in coming decades. The global pact calls for limiting warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, four degrees less than the NHTSA predicts. A full seven degrees would mark a dramatic twist of Earth's thermostat knob: From the height of the last ice age to now, tropical sea surface temperatures have increased by roughly that much.

In an interview with the Washington Post, MIT Sloan School of Management professor John Sterman called the forecast “a textbook example of how to lie with statistics.”

“First, the administration proposes vehicle efficiency policies that would do almost nothing [to fight climate change],” he said. “Then [the administration] makes their impact seem even smaller by comparing their proposals to what would happen if the entire world does nothing.”

The Trump administration says the rule is a necessary safety fix, arguing that it would lower the cost of newer vehicles and thus encourage people to get newer, safer cars. In an August 2018 story in the New York Times, outside experts questioned these arguments.

EPA Repeals Obama-Era Methane Rules
September 18, 2018

This week, the Trump administration Environmental Protection Agency announced final new rollbacks to Obama-era climate change policy, reducing requirements on oil and gas companies to monitor and mitigate releases of methane from wells and other operations.

Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas and regularly seeps from energy activities. Some in the industry had complained that the Obama-era rules were too burdensome.

The Interior Department is also expected to soon release a plan to return to allowing companies to intentionally flare off methane, an activity that environmentalists had said was wasteful and contributing to carbon emissions.

Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, praised the new changes to the New York Times. The Obama rules were ""a record-keeping nightmare that was technically impossible to execute in the field,” she told the paper. Yet environmentalists warn that more leaks will lead to more pollution.

The rules allow companies to follow laxer state guidelines and decrease the time required between inspections of equipment and for repairing leaks. The 2016 rule was expected to cost the industry $530 million by 2025. Yet the Obama administration had estimated that the fuel being wasted by leaks actually costs taxpayers $330 million a year in lost natural gas royalties.

When the new EPA rule was announced attorneys general in California and New Mexico filed suit, challenging the change.

 

Trump EPA Unveils Plan to Nullify Federal Rules on Coal Power Plants
August 21, 2018

As a candidate, one of Donald Trump’s signature promises was to weaken air pollution rules on coal-fired power plants. In a speech in West Virginia Tuesday, President Trump detailed the Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to reverse Obama Administration rules designed to curtail coal emissions of carbon dioxide and methane that contribute to climate change.

The Trump Administration’s new plan—called the Affordable Clean Energy rule—dismantles Obama’s federal rules over all American coal plants and gives regulating authority to each state. Some states, like California, may propose even harsher targets. But others, such as coal-rich states like West Virginia and Pennsylvania, are likely to loosen emissions regulations that coal industry leaders have called burdensome and expensive.

Despite legal challenges to the Obama plan, known as the Clean Power Plan, coal plants have declined in recent years. Since 2010, more than 200 American coal plants have been retired or taken offline. In that time, other energy sources including renewables like wind and solar have become more cost-effective and reliable. Yet Trump’s rules are likely to most affect aging coal plants across the country that pollute the most, making them more cost effective to run longer.

The move is likely to have a lasting effect on climate change. The U.S. is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses. Obama’s Clean Power Plan had intended to cut U.S. emissions 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. By the same measure, the Trump plan is expected to cut emissions only as much as 1.5 percent.

After the rule is submitted to the Federal Register, the public will have 60 days to comment before it is finalized. Environmental groups are expected to challenge it in court.

Trump Announces Plan to Weaken Obama-Era Fuel Economy Rules
August 2, 2018

The Trump administration announced a long-expected plan to dismantle an Obama-era policy that would have increased vehicle mileage standards for cars made over the next decade. The Obama rules were intended to limit vehicle emissions of greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change.

The vehicle emissions standards had been one of the signature policies of the Obama administration to confront climate change. They required light cars made after 2012 to become almost twice as efficient by 2025—averaging nearly 54 miles per gallon—in hopes of saving billions of barrels of oil needed to burn for fuel.

The Trump administration proposal, announced by both the Department or Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency, wouldn't nix the rules entirely but would halt the mileage targets at 34 miles per gallon by 2021. Beyond that number, some automakers complained, the targets would be too difficult to reach, and the added expense to innovate technology and alter production lines would cost jobs and increase prices for car buyers.

Other carmakers approved of the Obama rules, acknowledging that even if they were burdensome, they leveled the playing field for all automakers in all states, ensuring that no company could sell cheaper, less-efficient cars while others tried to innovate.

DOT and EPA officials cited passenger safety as their primary objective in rolling back the rules. People who owned more efficient cars would drive more, they said, putting them at greater risk of accidents. They also said that cars with better mileage would delay people from getting new cars with enhanced safety features. Some experts interviewed by the New York Times expressed skepticism at these explanations.

The Trump administration's move sets up a legal battle with more than a dozen states, led by California, that have passed their own set of higher fuel standards. Despite the relief from the Trump Administration's move, several companies have urged the administration to return to negotiations with states to agree on a uniform set of standards across the country. They argued that a fragmented system between federal and state rules, like the one Trump's rollback creates, would be a worst-case scenario.

Supreme Court Lets Children's Climate Change Lawsuit Move to Trial
July 30, 2018

Juliana v. United States, a lawsuit filed by 21 children against the federal government over climate change, is headed to trial later this year, after the Supreme Court rejected the Trump Administration’s efforts to derail the case.

In a four-sentence order issued July 30, Justice Anthony Kennedy rejected the government’s request that the case be stayed as “premature.” Kennedy noted that the “breadth of the (children’s) claim is striking…” But he cautioned that the complicated case presents “substantial grounds for difference of opinion” and warned the trial court to “take these concerns into account in assessing the burdens of discovery and trial…”

The trial is scheduled to begin October 29 in Eugene, Oregon.

- Laura Parker

The children’s suit, filed in federal court in 2015 by the non-profit Our Children’s Trust, alleges that the government has failed to protect Earth from the effects of climate change, putting the lives of future generations at risk and violating their basic constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property.

The Obama Administration sought unsuccessfully to have the case dismissed, arguing remedies for climate change are better addressed by Congress than in court. The Trump Administration was named as a defendant in the case in January 2017. In March, Trump Administration lawyers filed the first of several attempts to have the case dismissed or delayed. None succeeded, prompting the appeal to the high court.

Trump Officials Set Aside Evidence of National Monuments' Successes
July 23, 2018

As the Trump administration downsized Utah's Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments and reviewed dozens more, U.S. Department of the Interior officials dismissed evidence that the monument designations brought benefits, the Washington Post reports.

On July 16, the Interior Department's Freedom of Information Act team uploaded thousands of pages of documents that had not been completely redacted. The next day, officials took down these documents and replaced them.

The erroneously un-redacted documents contain facts that cast some monuments in a positive light. One 2017 analysis by the Bureau of Land Management mentioned that once Grand Staircase-Escalante became a national monument, the annual rate of archaeological listings in the area more than doubled, and vandalism dropped. In December 2017, President Trump moved to shrink the monument by 46 percent.

In another document, Interior Department official Randal Bowman recommended deleting fishing data from an assessment of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. The administration reviewed the Atlantic Ocean monument—which President Obama created in 2016—amid concerns that the monument's ban on fishing hurt local fishers.

Bowman sought to nix data showing that from 2005 to 2014, about two-thirds of the area's shipping vessels generated less than five percent of their annual landings from the waters that became the monument.

“This section is based on information provided by NOAA and the Fishery Management Council, and so can be presumed accurate,” he wrote in a comment. “However, including all this information undercuts the case for the ban being harmful.”

According to legal experts interviewed by the Post, Trump officials could argue that the intended redactions fall under the “deliberative privilege” exemption of the Freedom of Information Act. That clause aims to protect executive branch staffers as they honestly discuss and hone policies.

Trump Officials Propose Rollbacks of Endangered Species Act Rules
July 19, 2018

On Thursday, the Trump administration unveiled a proposal that would make several key changes to the Endangered Species Act—the 1973 law that has served as a bulwark against the bald eagle's extinction, among thousands of other species.

The plan calls for nixing a rule that forbids referring to the economic impacts of listing an endangered or threatened species. That said, the plan makes pains to say that determinations would still be based only on biological considerations. It also would give regulators greater freedom to avoid designating critical habitat for threatened and endangered species.

It also would tweak how the risks facing threatened species—which aren't endangered yet but could be in the foreseeable future—would be weighed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would constrain the definition of “foreseeable future” to “only so far into the future as the Services can reasonably determine that the conditions potentially posing a danger of extinction in the foreseeable future are probable.”

What's more, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed eliminating the blanket section 4(d) rule. Since the 1970s, this FWS policy gave threatened species all the protections given to endangered species, which face a more immediate risk of extinction, by default.

Unlike FWS, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service tacks on protections for threatened species one by one. The new proposal calls on FWS to adopt NOAA's case-by-case approach for future listings of threatened species. The hundreds of threatened plants and animals that currently have blanket 4(d) protections will continue to have them, according to FWS.

Already, environmental groups are strongly criticizing the plan.

“These proposals would slam a wrecking ball into the most crucial protections for our most endangered wildlife,” added Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “If these regulations had been in place in the 1970s, the bald eagle and the gray whale would be extinct today. If they’re finalized now, Zinke will go down in history as the extinction secretary.”

The proposed changes will be posted to the Federal Register in a matter of days. The Trump administration has invited public comment on the rules, which will be open for 60 days on regulations.gov after they are posted.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Resigns
July 5, 2018

EPA administrator Scott Pruitt resigned on Thursday, ending the tenure of the most divisive U.S. environmental lead in decades.

Pruitt's resignation, confirmed by President Trump in a statement on Twitter, comes after months of criticism and an ever-growing pile of ethics scandals.

Media reports found that Pruitt had racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in first-class flights, a $43,000 soundproof office phone booth, and more than $1,500 in fountain pens. A recent CNN report also alleges that Pruitt made his staff omit parts of his schedule from the public record.

Pruitt also caught fire for asking his staff for personal help. Pruitt reportedly asked his unprecedentedly large security detail to turn on their emergency lights as he ran late to a meal at a chic D.C. French restaurant. He also asked his detail to track down his favorite lotion, and he asked his top aides to retrieve his dry cleaning, pick up snacks, track down used hotel mattresses, and help find his wife a job.

Beyond his cavalcade of scandals, Pruitt also brought abrupt changes to U.S. environmental policy.

He halted an Obama-era request that fossil-fuel producers track methane emissions and overruled EPA scientists' plea to ban the insecticide chlorpyrifos. While Pruitt's EPA moved to make the water contaminant PFAS a national priority, officials also reportedly sought to delay a CDC report about the compound's toxicity.

The EPA under Pruitt moved hastily to end the Obama administration's signature environmental policies. Pruitt stalled the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration's effort to regulate power-plant emissions; wanted to weaken 2022-2025 car fuel economy standards; delayed the “Waters of the United States” rule for two years; and wanted to downwardly revise the “social cost of carbon,” a crucial stat when weighing the costs and benefits of fighting climate change.

Pruitt also advocated for the U.S. to leave the Paris climate accords—leaving the U.S. globally isolated on what scientists broadly agree is an environmental crisis.

In a contentious letter recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, two Harvard University researchers argue that the Trump administration's environmental policies, as championed by Pruitt, could kill an additional 80,000 people per decade when compared to prior policy.

Deputy EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, is now acting EPA administrator. He is widely expected to continue Pruitt’s policies.

White House Cuts NASA Climate Monitoring Program
May 9, 2018

Science magazine reports that the Trump administration has ended NASA's Carbon Monitoring System, a $10-million-per-year effort to fund pilot programs intended to improve the monitoring of global carbon emissions.

Congress directed the CMS's creation in 2010, but as Science reporter Paul Voosen notes, the March 2018 spending deal didn't specifically dedicate funds to the program—giving the White House sufficient latitude to wind it down. Researchers say that CMS-supported work is particularly relevant to the global Paris Agreement, especially for verifying whether the nations of the world are actually meeting their pledges to reduce carbon emissions.

“If you cannot measure emissions reductions, you cannot be confident that countries are adhering to the agreement,” said Kelly Sims Gallagher, a Tufts University climate policy expert, in an interview with Science.

The move marks the latest efforts of the Trump administration, which has rejected the Paris Agreement and an array of prior U.S. climate policies, to downsize NASA's climate science program. The White House has repeatedly called for the elimination of CMS and several other NASA climate missions, including the planned PACE, OCO-3, and CLARREO Pathfinder instruments. Trump officials also advocate the shutdown of the Earth-viewing instruments aboard DSCOVR, which have taken high-res pictures of our planet's sunlit half nearly every hour since July 2015.

Despite the closure of CMS, NASA will continue to operate several climate-monitoring satellites, and the agency is scheduled to launch two climate instruments to the International Space Station by the end of 2018. “The winding down of the CMS research program does not curb NASA’s ability or commitment to monitoring carbon and its effects on our changing planet,"" said NASA spokesperson Steve Cole in a statement to National Geographic.

Yet researchers contend that without CMS's support, research into how to make sense of these data will slow.

“The topic of climate mitigation and carbon monitoring is maybe not the highest priority now in the United States,” said University of Maryland climate scientist George Hurtt, the CMS science team leader, in an interview with Science. “But it is almost everywhere else.”

EPA Issues Controversial Rule on Science 'Transparency'
April 24, 2018

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt proposed a rule Tuesday that would only allow the agency to consider in its rule making scientific studies for which the underlying data are made available publicly. “The science that we use is going to be transparent. It’s going to be reproducible,” Pruitt told reporters.

Industry and conservative groups have called for this change for some time, while some environmental groups warn that it could reduce the EPA's ability to consider all the evidence available when making rules on tough questions like power plant emissions and the safety of everything from pesticides to consumer products.

In a letter, nearly 1,000 scientists (many of whom used to work at the EPA) asked Pruitt to abandon the proposal, which they said “would greatly weaken EPA's ability to comprehensively consider the scientific evidence.” Much of the data that would be excluded is based on reviews of personal health information, which is often not publicly available because of privacy laws or practical challenges.

“This proposal would mean throwing out the studies we rely on to protect the public, for no good reason,” said Betsy Southerland, a longtime EPA scientist, in a press release from the Union of Concerned Scientists. “This would have an enormous and negative impact on the EPA’s ability to enforce the law and protect people’s health. Administrator Pruitt can’t carry out the basic responsibilities of his job if he insists that his agency ignore the evidence.”

The rule change is subject to a 30-day public comment period.

Threatened Species Protection Rule Under Review
April 2, 2018

The White House is currently reviewing a regulation that some environmental groups fear could nix protections granted to nearly 300 threatened species.

In a surprise rule change submitted on Monday, the U.S. Department of the Interior has proposed removing what's called the “blanket section 4(d) rule.” Since the 1970s, this U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) policy has stated that by default, threatened species receive the full protections of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

The ESA affords wide-ranging protections to species on the brink of extinction, barring everything from outright poaching to coming too close to the species in the wild. These restrictions don't automatically apply to threatened species, but section 4(d) of the ESA says that departments can protect threatened species at their discretion.

Historically, different departments have used this discretion in different ways. By default, FWS's blanket section 4(d) rule gives threatened species every ESA protection, which regulators then clarify and whittle down. When the National Marine Fisheries Service lists a threatened species, however, it adds protections bit by bit.

The proposed removal of the blanket section 4(d) rule concerns environmental groups because it's possible that the move would jeopardize protections for hundreds of threatened species, which aren't yet facing the threat of extinction but could in the future.

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group, 294 species listed as threatened by the FWS are afforded protections only because of the blanket rule. The affected species include the northern spotted owl, the southern sea otter, the spotted seal, as well as eight species of coral and numerous plants.

“How are they going to deal with the species that are already listed as threatened?” asks Noah Greenwald, the endangered species director of the Center for Biological Diversity. “I think that's pretty critical, because there's no way they can publish 300 individual rules ... This certainly looks like a regulatory rollback.”

That said, the rule change's impact remains unclear. The proposed regulation hasn't been released, and once it is, it will be subject to a period of public comment. The Interior Department has not yet responded to National Geographic's emailed questions about the proposed rule change.

“The Center for Biological Diversity thinks it's the worst-case scenario—it's hard for me to assume that,” says Defenders of Wildlife vice president Bob Dreher, an FWS associate director during the Obama administration. “We are of course concerned, and we're going to be watching it very, very carefully.”

In gearing up for the rule change, the Trump administration appears to be responding to two legal petitions filed in 2016 by the Pacific Legal Foundation—a conservative public-interest law firm—on behalf of the Washington Cattlemen's Association and the National Federation of Independent Businesses.

The groups argue that by giving threatened species all ESA protections as a default, the blanket rule functionally eliminates the distinction between endangered and threatened species. They say the arrangement illegally flouts Congress and penalizes private landowners.

Jonathan Wood, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, maintains that rescinding the blanket rule won't hurt conservation. He argues that if threatened species have fewer protections than endangered species, then private landowners have an incentive to help endangered species recover to threatened status—since the upgrade in status removes onerous regulations. (Read more about the debate over the Endangered Species Act.)

“Recovery for endangered species is abysmally low ... By varying the protections, you better align the incentives of the property owners with the incentives of the endangered species,” he says. “Ideally, we boost that recovery rate.”

Environmental groups and Wood disagree vehemently on the ESA's efficacy. But they agree on one major point: the text of the regulation may take months to be released, and until then, it's unclear how threatened species will be treated.

“Without seeing the proposed rule and the reasons it gives, it's hard to say too much,” says Wood.

That said, Dreher offers a word of caution to the Department of the Interior: “If they take an approach which leaves threatened species arbitrarily unprotected, you can be sure that we and other organizations will sue.”

EPA Starts Rollback of Car Emissions Standards
April 2, 2018

In a press release, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced that the U.S. government would revisit the Obama administration's fuel efficiency standards for cars and light-duty trucks—the first step in a rollback of one of the U.S.'s biggest efforts to curb carbon emissions.

In July 2011, President Obama announced he would tighten regulations of vehicle greenhouse gas emissions, with rules that were first finalized in August 2012. Under Obama-era policy, cars and light-duty trucks would be required to have average fuel efficiencies equivalent to 54.5 miles per gallon by model year 2025.

About a sixth of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 came from passenger cars and light-duty trucks. Overall, the Obama program would've reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons—more than the total CO2 the U.S. emitted in 2016.

The EPA committed to finishing a midterm evaluation of the 2022-2025 standards by no later than April 1, 2018. On January 12, 2017, outgoing Obama EPA administrator Gina McCarthy finalized the evaluation and reaffirmed the stringent emissions standards.

At the time, car manufacturers argued that the 2022-2025 standards were unrealistic, expensive, and politically rushed. The Trump administration has enthusiastically echoed these sentiments; it restarted the midterm evaluation in March 2017.

“The Obama administration's determination was wrong,” Pruitt said in a statement. “Obama’s EPA cut the Midterm Evaluation process short with politically charged expediency, made assumptions about the standards that didn’t comport with reality, and set the standards too high.”

Automakers struck a guardedly pleased tone in releases about the announcement, seemingly leery that they may be getting more rollbacks out of the Trump EPA than they originally bargained for. Already, environmental and public health groups are voicing fierce opposition.

“Starting a process to weaken clean car standards marks yet another step backward from the fight to curb climate change,” said Harold P. Wimmer, the national president and CEO of the American Lung Association, in a statement. “Climate change poses serious threats to millions of people, especially to some of the most vulnerable Americans, including children, older adults and those living with chronic diseases such as asthma.”

“Pruitt’s rollback of the EPA clean car standards is a U-turn in the fight against climate change. We don’t know exactly how far the agency will back-track until they publish new standards, but we can be sure that it will make achieving a low-carbon transportation system more difficult and likely more expensive,” wrote Luke Tonachel, the clean vehicles director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.

Globally, lowering U.S. emissions standards could bolster other countries to weaken their own emissions standards. Within the U.S., a rollback would set up a legal trench war between the EPA and the state of California. Under a waiver it received at the dawn of the EPA, California has the authority to set its own, more stringent emissions standards. Twelve other states and the District of Columbia—in all, a third of the U.S. population—follow California's lead.

“We’re ready to file suit if needed to protect these critical standards and to fight the administration’s war on our environment,” said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a statement. “California didn’t become the sixth-largest economy in the world by spectating.”

Zinke Offers Support for Grizzlies in North Cascades
March 23, 2018

In a move that pleased conservationists and infuriated cattlemen, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke announced his support for efforts to return the grizzly bear to the North Cascades ecosystem.

""The grizzly bear is part of the environment, as it once was here. It's part of a healthy environment,"" he said according to The Seattle Times.

Zinke said that by the end of 2018, U.S. officials would complete a plan for returning the grizzly bear to the North Cascades, a rugged ecosystem that straddles the U.S. state of Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that fewer than 50 grizzly bears now live in the region, which is isolated from other grizzly populations in North America.

In 2013, the Fish and Wildlife Service found that the North Cascades grizzly bear warranted an endangered listing under the Endangered Species Act. The following year, the Seattle Times reports that the Obama administration announced a three-year recovery study. In 2017, the study was halted; now, with Zinke's support, it will presumably continue.

FEMA Expels ""Climate Change"" From Strategic Plan
March 16, 2018

NPR reports that the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has stricken “climate change” and associated verbiage from its strategic plan, on the heels of one of the most expensive years of natural disasters in modern U.S. history.

The plan, published on March 15, says that one of the agency’s major strategic goals is to “ready the nation for catastrophic disasters.” As NPR noted, it does discuss the potential for rising disaster costs:

Disaster costs are expected to continue to increase due to rising natural hazard risk, decaying critical infrastructure, and economic pressures that limit investments in risk resilience. As good stewards of taxpayer dollars, FEMA must ensure that our programs are fiscally sound. Additionally, we will consider new pathways to long-term disaster risk reduction, including increased investments in pre-disaster mitigation.

In a statement to NPR, FEMA Public Affairs Director William Booher said that “this strategic plan fully incorporates future risks from all hazards regardless of cause.”

In the plan, FEMA does not elaborate on the causes of “rising natural hazard risk,” which include human-caused climate change. As National Geographic previously reported, two recent studies found that the record rainfall from Hurricane Harvey—which cost roughly $125 billion—got a 15-percent boost thanks to climate change. The studies also found that climate change roughly tripled the odds of a storm of Harvey’s intensity.

The threats of climate change featured in FEMA strategic plans drafted under the Obama administration, as well as earlier ones. In a 2008 strategic plan drafted under the George W. Bush administration, then-FEMA director R. David Paulison said that future years “will likely present our nation with equally challenging events, including technological incidents, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or extreme weather events spawned by global warming.”

EPA Mulls Shake-Up to Environmental Research Program
February 26, 2018

The Trump administration is thinking about reorganizing an EPA group that funds research on children’s health and environmental health disparities affecting minorities and the poor.

According to the proposal, the EPA would consolidate its National Center for Environmental Research (NCER), a branch of the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, with two other offices related to grant-making. The combined office would field Freedom of Information Requests, manage EPA records, and administer grants.

In a statement to Earther, EPA spokesperson Liz Bowman said that the move is intended to make the agency more efficient. She added that the management of research grants would continue and that none of NCER’s current staff would be fired.

When news of the reorganization first broke, some raised concerns that NCER’s work would fall by the wayside. Currently, NCER oversees EPA’s STAR (Science to Achieve Results) program, which issues grants and fellowships to outside environmental researchers. STAR funding helps support the U.S.’s Children’s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers, which examine pollution’s effects on children’s health.

In 2017, STAR earned acclaim from the National Academies—the U.S.’s preeminent scientific body—for its support of high-quality science, including work showing that infants could be exposed to arsenic via rice cereal. Yet from 2002 to 2016, STAR’s budget declined by more than 70 percent (adjusting for inflation) to $36 million, E&E News reports. In its FY2019 budget request, the Trump EPA called for STAR’s elimination.

In an interview with National Geographic, a senior EPA official said that the reorganized office would continue STAR if Congress funds it. The official added that new STAR grants would probably dovetail with the EPA’s priorities under administrator Scott Pruitt, which the agency laid out in its 2018-2022 strategic plan.

Pruitt’s “back-to-basics” plan calls for a focus on maintaining air quality, implementing recent chemical-safety reforms, funding infrastructure for drinking water, and accelerating the cleanup of Superfund sites. Missing from the document is any mention of climate change or carbon dioxide, points of emphasis in Obama-era EPA strategic plans.

Trump Proposes Cuts to Climate and Clean-Energy Programs
February 12, 2018

In its FY2019 budget and addendum, the Trump administration has proposed sweeping rollbacks to U.S. programs designed to study and mitigate the effects of climate change, as well as cuts to research on renewable energy.

At this point, the budget is merely an opening bid in negotiations with Congress; last year, lawmakers largely ignored similar proposed cuts. Nevertheless, the budget provides insight into the White House's priorities.

For instance, the EPA budget suggests eliminating the environmental agency's climate-change research program, which currently costs the agency $16 million per year. In addition, the EPA has proposed axing several voluntary emissions-reductions programs and STAR, which funds environmental research and graduate student fellowships.

Other parts of the budget trim environmental services, such as the EPA's Report on the Environment, and cut the agency's Human Health Risk Assessment program by nearly 40 percent.

As it did in 2017, the Trump administration has proposed axing several NASA Earth-science missions, including PACE and OCO-3. (Read more about the targeted missions.)

The budget also calls for shutting down the Earth-facing instruments aboard DSCOVR, which is already flying. These instruments include EPIC, which continually photographs Earth's sunlit half to measure the planet's energy budget.

The White House has proposed eliminating the U.S. State Department's Global Climate Change Initiative, which in 2017 received $160 million in funding. The program primarily aims to help other countries better weather the impacts of climate change. Though most developing countries did little to contribute to ongoing climate change, developing countries will be more severely affected.

The Trump administration's 2019 budget also advocates for a 55-percent cut in spending on the Department of Energy's applied R&D programs. The cuts would shrink the agency's $3.77-billion budget to slightly less than $1.7 billion. In its justification, the White House says that the move would refocus R&D efforts from late-stage development to early-stage research.

At the same time, the budget cuts investments in early-stage research by axing ARPA-E, the Department of Energy's $305-million advanced research program. The budget also calls for nearly a 40-percent cut to the department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, even after accounting for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), which recently increased FY2019 spending levels.

At the same time, the budget calls for increases in spending on fossil fuels. Including the BBA, the Department of Energy's budget calls for an extra $281 million on fossil-fuel R&D, $200 million of which would be spent on “clean coal.” (Can coal ever be clean?)

Unlike last year, the Trump administration is no longer proposing the destruction of the popular ENERGY STAR program, which certifies energy-efficient appliances. Instead, it wants to charge companies that seek the labeling, using those “user fees” to make the program financially self-sufficient.

Report: Trump Mulling Major Cuts to Clean Energy Research
January 31, 2018

The Washington Post reports that in its 2019 budget, the Trump administration is seeking to slash Department of Energy funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives by 72 percent.

Congress would likely oppose such steep cuts in any future budget negotiations, but the move further signals the Trump administration's avowed support of fossil-fuel industries.

News of the proposed cuts comes the day after President Trump praised “beautiful clean coal” in his State of the Union address, and several days after Trump announced steep tariffs on imported solar panels. (Find out more about the myth of “clean coal.”)

According to Post reporters Chris Mooney and Steven Mufson, leaked budget documents reportedly show that the administration is seeking to cut funding for the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by more than 70 percent, from an enacted 2017 budget of $2.04 billion to $575.5 million. The Post also reports that the budget suggests staffing cuts, from 680 staffers in 2017 to a proposed 450 in 2019.

“I will not comment on a budget that has not been released. However, I will suggest that anyone who questions this administration’s commitment to an all-of-the-above energy approach simply look at our record,"" Department of Energy spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said in a statement. ""Last year the Energy Department awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to solar and wind energy.

""Though it may not fit into the narrative of the environmental lobby and their pundits, the truth is that Secretary Perry believes that there is a role for all fuels—including renewables—in our energy mix.”

This would not be the first time that the Trump administration has attempted to slash this sort of funding. In its 2018 budget, the Trump administration sought cuts of more than two-thirds for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which Congress rejected.

EPA LOOSENS REGULATIONS ON TOXIC AIR POLLUTION
January 25, 2018

In a brief legal memo, the Trump EPA has dropped “once in, always in” (OIAI), a Clinton-era EPA policy that aimed to lock in reductions of hazardous air pollution from industrial sources.

Industry lawyers and Senate Republicans have long argued that eliminating OIAI will actually provide a stronger incentive for businesses to reduce emissions, since they can now more easily lower emissions and avoid the regulations that major pollution sources must endure.

However, environmental activists and lawyers are concerned with the abrupt change, saying that it may actually increase exposure to hazardous air pollution—especially among vulnerable populations, who live near major industrial polluters more often.

“They’re really going to be killing people,” said Hip-Hop Caucus vice president Mustafa Ali, the former environmental justice head at EPA, in an interview with Earther. “You’re going to have all types of public health problems.”

To see how OIAI worked, imagine a business that emits 11 tons of a given hazardous air pollutant (HAP) per year. Under EPA regulations, facilities that emit more than 10 tons of one HAP, or 25 tons of HAPs in total, are reclassified from area sources to major sources.

By law, major sources must retool their processes to get their emissions down to the lowest levels set by peers within the industry. These benchmarks are called the Maximum Achievable Control Technology, or MACT, standards.

By hewing to MACT standards, let's say the company's HAP emissions go down from 11 tons per year to three tons. According to OIAI, the company would have to abide by MACT standards permanently, locking in eight tons of annual emissions reductions.

Under the new EPA policy, however, the company could do just enough to reduce emissions from 11 tons to nine. By dropping below the 10-ton threshold, the company goes from being a major source to being an area source—thereby jettisoning the MACT requirement.

While going from 11 tons of emissions to nine is technically a reduction, it's actually more pollution relative to what the facility could have achieved by complying with MACT standards. This phenomenon, called “backsliding,” is what OIAI aimed to prevent.

Environmental groups are poised to sue the EPA to block the policy change.

“This is among the most dangerous actions that the Trump EPA has taken yet against public health,” said John Walke, clean air director at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), in a statement. “NRDC will fight this terrible decision to unleash toxic pollutants with every available tool.”

Most of National Parks Advisory Board Resigns in Protest
January 15, 2018

Nine of the 12 members of the National Park System Advisory Board resigned on January 15, the Washington Post reported on January 16, in protest of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's refusal to meet with them.

First chartered by Congress in 1935, the civilian group is required to contain academic experts, experienced park managers, and at least one former elected official from an area adjacent to a national park.

The board advises the National Park System, the National Park Service, and the Secretary of the Interior on a wide range of matters, and it also helps to select national historic landmarks. Its members are unpaid.

""I wasn't voted in, but I realize I represent people beyond myself,"" says Carolyn Finney, a University of Kentucky geographer who had served on the board since 2010. ""When you slam the door in the face of me and the board, you're also slamming the door on a whole lot of other people.""

In a joint letter, Finney and other departing board members expressed frustration at Secretary Zinke's refusal to meet with them.

""For the last year we have stood by waiting for the chance to meet... We understand the complexity of transition but our requests to engage have been ignored, and the matters on which we wanted to brief the new Department team are clearly not part of its agenda,"" wrote Tony Knowles, the board's departing chair and a former Alaska governor, in a resignation letter co-signed by Finney and seven other board members.

""I wish the National Park System and Service well and will always be dedicated to their success,"" Knowles's letter continued. ""However, from all of the events of this past year I have a profound concern that the mission of stewardship, protection, and advancement of our National Parks has been set aside.""

In May, the Washington Post reported that the Interior Department began a sweeping review of more than 200 advisory boards and other entities associated with the department. Around the same time, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt dismissed several members of the agency's Board of Scientific Counselors.

Report: Climate Change Web Sites 'Censored' Under Trump
January 10, 2018

A new report finds that in the first year of the Trump administration, U.S. government websites have been systematically altered to cut mentions of climate change. However, there is no evidence of tampering with climate data.

The report, published by the nonprofit Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI), says that several government agencies—notably the EPA—have removed or reduced their web content about climate change.

Since Trump's inauguration, the group has monitored thousands of government web pages for changes or deletions. In some instances, ""climate change"" is replaced with the vaguer words ""sustainability"" or ""resiliency."" In others, some climate change webpages are taken down entirely.

For instance, the Bureau of Land Management's web page on climate change was taken down between May and November 2017, the report states. The EPA's ""Student's Guide to Global Climate Change"" went offline sometime between February and April 2017.

""While we cannot determine the reasons for these changes from monitoring websites alone, our work reveals shifts in stated priorities and governance and an overall reduction in access to climate change information, particularly at the EPA,"" the group says.

EDGI emphasizes that, so far, it hasn't seen evidence of the removal or deletion of climate data sets, as some scientists and activists had feared.

(Full disclosure: the National Geographic Society has given grants to Data Refuge and the Climate Adaptation Knowledge Exchange, which are archiving U.S. climate data.)

TRUMP INTERIOR DEPARTMENT DECLARES THAT ACCIDENTAL BIRD DEATHS ARE LEGAL
December 22, 2017

Reversing Obama-era policy, the Trump administration has decreed that it will no longer consider the accidental killing of birds—from eagles colliding with wind turbines to ducks zapped on power lines—a violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA).

“It reverses decades of precedent over 20 administrations,” says Sarah Greenberger, the National Audubon Society’s vice president of conservation policy. “It’s a shocking step to break with that kind of tradition, and it’s of great concern.”

The law, which turns a hundred years old in 2018, is among the United States’ oldest and widest-reaching environmental protections. Originally envisioned to save birds from overhunting, the law now safeguards more than 1,025 migratory bird species and their eggs, feathers, and nests. Illegally killing a protected bird can result in a $15,000 fine and up to six months in jail.

The law—which prohibits harming protected species ""at any time, or in any manner""—had been interpreted as forbidding “incidental takes,” the accidental yet foreseeable deaths of birds from industrial activity. But the phrase itself does not appear in the law. Through the years, some U.S. courts had questioned whether the MBTA really does cover incidental takes.

In a memo published on January 10, 2017, Hilary Tompkins—the outgoing solicitor for the Obama Interior Department—found that all forms of incidental take were prohibited under the MBTA. In her memo, she cites the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s longtime interpretation of the law and decades of successful prosecutions.

Tompkins also notes that Canada—the co-signer of the Migratory Bird Treaty of 1916, which sparked the MBTA—interprets it as requiring the prohibition of incidental takes.

But on February 6, the incoming Trump administration rescinded Tompkins’ guidance, pending a review. On December 22, it was replaced entirely by a memo reaching the opposite conclusion, relying in part on some U.S. courts’ skeptical rulings.

The analysis, penned by Daniel Jorjani—one of the Trump Interior Department’s highest-ranking lawyers and a former adviser to the Koch brothers—instead finds that the word “take” describes a willful, deliberate act. What’s more, he says that for industry, the threat of being prosecuted for incidental takes is an undue burden.

“Interpreting the MBTA to apply to incidental or accidental actions hangs the sword of Damocles over a host of otherwise lawful and productive actions,” Jorjani wrote in the new memo.

Conservation groups are outraged by the decision. If the MBTA no longer covers incidental take, some experts fear that industry may not invest in systems that save many birds’ lives, such as covers for oil pits, more widely spaced power lines, or camera systems that slow wind turbines when birds are present.

""The statement made by this administration basically says that the real problem...is poaching birds for feathers for ladies' hats,"" says Defenders of Wildlife vice president Bob Dreher, who served as associate director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under Obama. ""They're turning this thing into an antique.""

Energy companies, in particular, have been regularly penalized for incidental takes. After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, the largest in U.S. history, federal officials used the MBTA to secure $100 million in fines from BP that went toward bird conservation efforts.

One 2014 study found that the spill killed anywhere from 600,000 to 800,000 birds in the Gulf of Mexico, including a third of the northern Gulf’s laughing gull population.

Renewable energy and fossil-fuel groups alike have praised the MBTA reversal. “This commonsense approach ensures that lawful activities are not held hostage to unnecessary threats of criminalization,” the National Ocean Industries Association said in a statement.

“We don’t dispute the need for energy,” says Greenberger. “It just seems so unnecessary to have taken this step.”

News of the reversal comes as National Geographic, the National Audubon Society, and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology kick off the Year of the Bird. The joint effort will explore and celebrate birds, as well as document the threats facing them.

“I think we will celebrate, but we also intend to use this partnership to remind people how much of a part of our lives birds are—and what it takes to protect them,” says Greenberger.

Trump Drops Climate Change From List of National Security Threats
December 18, 2017

President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will no longer regard climate change by name as a national security threat.

The stance marks an abrupt turn from the Obama administration, which in 2015 described climate change as “an urgent and growing threat to our national security,” given its effects on natural disasters, conflicts over food and water, and refugee crises.

In contrast, the Trump administration’s national security strategy, published Monday, discusses climate change only within the context of U.S. energy policy.

“Climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system, [and] U.S. leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests,” the report reads. “Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty.”

As National Geographic has previously reported, humans’ dramatic alteration of the global climate is not only scientific fact, but it also poses numerous security threats to the United States and the world.

Depending on the region, extreme weather events—such as droughts, wildfires, heatwaves, and torrential rains—may become more frequent and intense under climate change, posing threats to military installations and civilian communities alike. As weather patterns change, some disease-bearing creatures such as mosquitoes will enjoy longer active seasons over wider areas, exacerbating threats to public health.

In addition, rising seas threaten to cripple coastal military infrastructure, an ongoing concern at the U.S. Navy’s installation in Norfolk, Virginia. Melting ice means that the normally ice-clogged Arctic is poised to transform into a major shipping route, altering regional geopolitics. Warmer, more acidic waters will kill off many coral reefs, which supply food and income to millions. And as sea levels rise, flooding will displace coastal populations.

“We’ve seen that 700,000 refugees coming from Syria have shaken the European Union to its core. Take that number and multiply it by 100 who would be forced to leave the coasts, and that’s the kind of change we are going to unleash upon ourselves,” said David Titley, a climate scientist at Penn State University and retired U.S. Navy rear admiral, in a previous interview.

“The impacts of that on security or economics are fundamentally unknowable,” he added. “But anybody who thinks that’s not a huge risk is probably smoking something.”

Despite Trump’s change in emphasis, it’s possible that U.S. government research on climate change will continue—under an assumed name. Since Trump’s inauguration, U.S. government websites seeking to scrub “climate change” from their records have opted to swap out the phrase for the word “resilience.”

For instance, a division within the Department of Defense’s environmental research programs that had been named for climate change is now named for “resiliency.” An EPA web page devoted to “climate ready” water management now discusses “resilient water utilities.”

What does President Trump’s national security strategy say about “resilience,” then?

“Resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover rapidly from deliberate attacks, accidents, natural disasters, as well as unconventional stresses, shocks, and threats to our economy and democratic system,” the report states. “Through risk-informed investments, we will build resilient communities and infrastructure to protect and benefit future generations.”

Trump Unveils Plan to Dramatically Downsize Two National Monuments
December 4, 2017

In a speech delivered in Salt Lake City, President Trump announced his intention to sharply reduce two Utah national monuments established by his predecessors.

In a move presaged by leaked government documents, Trump announced that he would reduce the 1.35-million acre Bears Ears National Monument, created by President Barack Obama in late 2016, by 85 percent. The president also said he would cut the 1.88-million acre Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, designated by President Bill Clinton in 1996, nearly in half.

Indian nations, conservation groups, and paleontologists have filed suit over the expected changes, among the most sweeping efforts taken by a U.S. president to downsize national monuments.

Interior Department Proposes Largest-Ever Oil and Gas Lease Auction
October 23, 2017

The U.S. Department of Interior has proposed auctioning off oil and gas leases for 77 million acres of federal waters within the Gulf of Mexico—the largest lease auction of its kind ever announced.

In an October 23 statement, the Interior Department says that it will auction off the oil and gas leases for all available unleased areas on the Gulf of Mexico’s outer continental shelf, in waters off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The auction is about a million acres larger than the most recent auction of its ilk, which occurred under the Obama administration in August 2016.

“In today’s low-price energy environment, providing the offshore industry access to the maximum amount of opportunities possible is part of our strategy to spur local and regional economic dynamism and job creation and a pillar of President Trump’s plan to make the United States energy dominant,” said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in a statement.

The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimates that the Gulf of Mexico’s outer continental shelf contains over 48 billion barrels of oil and 141 trillion cubic feet of gas that are technically recoverable. EPA estimates suggest that if these fossil fuels were burned completely, they would add the equivalent of more than 28 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere—more than five times the United States’ total carbon footprint in 2016.

The announcement comes days after an oil pipeline off the coast of Louisiana spilled some 672,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, the largest oil leak in the Gulf since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, which was more than 300 times bigger. Forecasters say that the oil, which dispersed under 5,000 feet of water, is not expected to impact the shoreline, according to an ABC report.

Trump EPA Poised to Scrap Clean Power Plan
October 9, 2017

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is poised to withdraw the Clean Power Plan, the lynchpin of the Obama Administration's effort to combat climate change, the New York Times reported Monday.

In a speech delivered in Hazard, Kentucky, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt declared that he will sign a proposal on Tuesday that would eliminate the Clean Power Plan (CPP), claiming that “the war on coal is over.”

Unveiled in 2015, the Clean Power Plan mandated that the U.S. power sector's carbon emissions be cut by 32 percent from 2005 by 2030 (870 million tons of CO2), slashing the single biggest contributor to the country's overall carbon footprint.

Utility companies and 27 states sued the EPA over the rule, arguing that because the CPP encouraged a broader shift away from coal-fired power plants, the EPA had overstepped its authority under the Clean Air Act. The rule remained in legal limbo as a result.

President Trump campaigned on repealing the CPP, decrying it as an unfair burden on the coal industry and overall economy. EPA Administrator Pruitt, a longtime ally of fossil-fuel interests, advocated for the CPP's repeal when he was Oklahoma's attorney general.

A new report by the Rhodium Group, a policy research firm, finds that the U.S. power sector is now on track to reduce its 2030 emissions by 27 to 35 percent relative to 2005, in line with the CPP's initial goal. However, as the New York Times noted, that same report finds that the CPP would have required up to 21 states to cut their emissions more deeply than existing regulations call for. As a result, the CPP likely would have reduced U.S. power-sector emissions even further.

Beyond the potential climate hazards, experts and advocates have criticized the CPP's repeal on public health grounds. Not only do coal-fired power plants emit carbon dioxide, but they also emit sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter—all potent respiratory irritants. The Obama Administration's EPA had estimated that the CPP would bring up to $54 billion in climate and public health benefits, avoiding 1,500 to 3,600 premature deaths and 90,000 asthma attacks in children.

The EPA under Trump has taken a different tack. In a leaked draft obtained by POLITICO, the cost-benefit analysis for repealing the CPP at times assumes that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards pose no health hazard. There is little scientific evidence to support this claim, says George Thurston, an expert on air pollutants' health risks at the New York University School of Medicine.

“It's just as specious as saying people are at absolutely no risk of a car accident below the legal speed limit,” Thurston said in a teleconference organized by the American Lung Association.

Mining Health Study Halted; Climate Advisory Panel Disbanded
August 22, 2017

The Trump administration has suspended a study of health risks to residents who live near mountaintop removal coal mine sites in the Appalachian Mountains. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine was asked by the Interior Department’s Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement in an August 18 letter to “cease all activities” involved in the two-year, $1 million research project while the department undertakes a review of projects costing more than $100,000. The review was prompted by “the department’s changing budget situation,” the letter said.

The academies undertook the study last year at the request of West Virginia’s state government, after researchers at the University of West Virginia and other institutions found increased risks of birth defects, cancer, and premature death, according to reporting by Ken Ward, Jr. of the Charleston, West Virginia Gazette-Mail.

President Trump proposed cutting $1.6 billion—or 12 percent—from the Interior budget in 2018. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told a Senate committee in June that he supports the budget cuts, which includes cutting 4,000 jobs. “This is what a balanced budget looks like,” he said.

The academies went ahead with previously planned meetings in Hazard and Lexington, Kentucky communities to hear from coal country residents.

“The National Academies believes this is an important study and we stand ready to resume it as soon as the Department of Interior review is completed,” William Kearney, the academies executive director said in a statement. The academies are private, nonprofit institutions that conduct independent analysis and provide advice on complex public policy issues related to science, technology, and medicine, the statement says. They operate under an 1863 congressional charter signed by President Lincoln.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration also disbanded a federal advisory panel for the National Climate Assessment. The 15-member group was created in 2015 to help businesses and state and local governments understand and prepare for the government’s next National Climate Assessment. That report, required by law to be issued every four years, is due in 2018. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokeswoman said the disbanding of the advisory panel, whose charter expired August 20, will not affect completion of the National Climate Assessment.

TRUMP REVOKES FLOOD STANDARDS ACCOUNTING FOR SEA-LEVEL RISE
August 15, 2017

President Trump has signed an executive order revoking federal flood-risk standards that incorporated rising sea levels predicted by climate science.

Trump’s new executive order claims to improve federal infrastructure decisions by quickening and streamlining the environmental review process. A single sentence takes the additional step of revoking Executive Order 13690, signed by President Barack Obama on January 30, 2015.

That executive order required that federally funded projects hew to a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, to reduce the risk of future flood damage. Specifically, the order required that floodplains had to be based on the “best-available, actionable hydrologic and hydraulic data and methods that integrate current and future changes in flooding based on climate science.”

From 1993 to 2016, global average sea level has increased by about 3.25 inches and is projected to rise one to four feet by the end of the century. Higher sea-level rise cannot be ruled out, due to incomplete data on Antarctic ice-shelf stability. Since the 1960s, tidal flooding has increased at least fivefold in several U.S. cities.

U.S. cities are predicted to see more floods in the coming years. A recent Union of Concerned Scientists report found that chronic flooding—a flood roughly every two weeks—will come to affect more than 170 U.S. coastal communities in less than 20 years and some 670 communities by 2100.

REPORT: EPA ENFORCEMENT LAGS UNDER TRUMP
August 10, 2017

A newly published report asserts that in its first six months, the EPA under the Trump administration is off to a slow start enforcing environmental laws.

The report, published by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project, examined lawsuits filed by the EPA from January 20 to July 31, 2017, roughly the Trump administration’s first six months in power. Over that time, the EPA has filed fewer lawsuits against companies for breaking pollution control laws than the agency had during the opening months of the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations.

The Trump EPA also lags by other key metrics, the report finds. So far, its actions against violators have avoided 22 estimated premature deaths, and it has collected $12 million of civil penalties. In comparison, the Obama administration had avoided some 229 premature deaths and collected $36 million in penalties—and in its first six months, the EPA under George W. Bush had avoided some 618 premature deaths and had collected $30 million in penalties.

“This is the weakest start any of us has seen in at least 24 years,” says Eric Schaeffer, the executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and the EPA’s former director of civil enforcement.

In a press call, Schaeffer and the report’s other coauthors expressed concern that the Trump EPA will not make enforcement a priority—a fear they say is only reinforced by proposed budget cuts. The Trump administration has called for a 23-percent cut to the agency’s enforcement budget and an agency-wide budget cut of 31 percent.

In a statement, EPA deputy assistant administrator Patrick Traylor emphasized that the report’s short time window can’t account for the months to years it can take to police possible violators.

“This ‘snapshot’ assertions (sic) say much more about enforcement actions commenced in the later years of the Obama administration than it does about actions taken in the beginning of the Trump administration,” he adds. “Despite this unfair report, EPA is committed to enforcing environmental laws to correct noncompliance and promote cleanup of contaminated sites.”

Interior Department Relaxes Aspects of Sage Grouse Protection
August 7, 2017

The Department of the Interior has released the results of a 60-day review of the Obama administration’s conservation plan to protect the greater sage grouse. The review, ordered in June by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, was intended to determine if that plan interferes with Trump administration efforts to increase energy production on federal lands.

In light of the newly published review, Secretary Zinke recommends reprioritizing oil development within the broader 2015 plan, among other changes. Environmental groups have rebuked the overhaul, arguing that changes to the 2015 plan could dilute protections for the species.

“Today, the administration’s review opens the door to significant changes to the sage-grouse plans, which could undercut the sound science used to develop those plans and jeopardize what we know the bird needs to live and thrive,” said Eric Holst, the associate vice president of working lands for the Environmental Defense Fund, in a statement. “By reopening the federal plans, we risk undermining and undoing one of the greatest collaborative conservation efforts in our nation’s history.”

The Obama plan was drawn up as an alternative to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decision to list the sage grouse for protection under the Endangered Species Act. The approach, which involved a five-year negotiation between 1,100 ranchers, environmental groups, and state and federal agencies, was hailed as an unprecedented collaboration that had reduced the threat to sage grouse habitat while avoiding a more stringent regulatory intervention that might hinder economic development. Fish and Wildlife declined to list the sage grouse after the collaborative conservation plan was unveiled in 2015.

The sage grouse habitat spans 173 million acres in 11 western states, including the Dakotas, and three Canadian provinces. Before the West was settled, the sage grouse once roamed over 290 million acres. In launching the 60-day review, Zinke said: “While the federal government has a responsibility under the Endangered Species Act to responsibly manage wildlife, destroying local communities and levying onerous regulations on the public lands that they rely on is no way to be a good neighbor.” Rewriting the Obama plan could extend beyond President Trump’s term, when public comment periods, new proposals and legal challenges are taken into account.

EPA DROPS DELAY OF OBAMA-ERA OZONE STANDARDS
August 2, 2017

In an about-face spurred by a 16-state lawsuit, the Trump administration EPA has dropped its decision to delay Obama-era regulations on ozone. The potent lung irritant forms when strong sunlight irradiates emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources.

In October 2015, the Obama administration tightened the ozone national standard from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion, citing ozone’s toll on public health. The Obama administration estimated that the reduction would yield $2.9 to $5.9 billion worth of health benefits in 2025, outweighing its estimated annual cost of $1.4 billion.

Few were entirely thrilled with the 2015 regulations. Environmental and public-health groups criticized the regulation as not stringent enough, citing evidence that ozone still poses a public health threat at 70 parts per billion, the upper end of the ozone standards recommended by scientists advising the EPA. Meanwhile, industry groups and their allies in Congress criticized the rule for the costs it would inflict.

In June, the EPA announced its intent to delay the implementation of the rule from October 1, 2017, to October 1, 2018, citing lingering questions and the regulation’s complexities. In response, 16 Democratic state attorneys general and the District of Columbia petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the one-year delay.

In its reversal the next day, the EPA cited its “commitment to working with the states.”

NOAA CANCELS RULE TO PROTECT WHALES FROM FISHING NETS
June 13, 2017

The Trump Administration this week cancelled a rule that would have helped prevent endangered whales and sea turtles from becoming entangled in fishing nets off the U.S. West Coast. Proposed in 2015, the rule would have closed the swordfish gill net fishery for up to two years if any two individual endangered whales or sea turtles were killed or seriously hurt within a two-year period. The same penalties would have applied if any combination of four bottlenose dolphins or short-finned pilot whales were injured or killed within a two-year period.

This week, however, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s fisheries division announced that the rule is no longer necessary because other protections have reduced the number of marine mammals entangled in gill nets. “What changed is that our more detailed analysis demonstrated to us that the hard caps would likely impose significant additional cost on the fleet without much additional conservation benefit,” says Michael Milstein, a NOAA fisheries spokesman.

Entanglements were common in the 1990s. But only two gray whales have been killed or seriously injured since 2012, according to NOAA. The short-beaked dolphin is the most frequently entangled marine mammal, and the number of annual entanglements of this species has declined from 200 killed in the early 1990s to fewer than 10 injured or killed in 2015.

New net design has helped reduce casualties, NOAA says. But environmentalists say that a more likely explanation for the reduced entanglements is the significant drop in the number of fishermen working the waters. The swordfish fleet has declined by almost 90 percent since the 1990s—from 141 boats in 1990 to just 20 boats in 2016. Leatherback turtles, humpback whales, and sperm whales are still being killed in gill nets, a spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity told the Los Angeles Times.

Interior Suggests Shrinking Bears Ears
June 12, 2017

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended that Bears Ears National Monument in southern Utah’s red rock country be shrunk by President Trump. Zinke declined to say at a press conference how much Bears Ears’ boundaries should be downsized. But he suggested the rich cache of ancient tribal artifacts inside the monument—one of the largest collections in the nation—could be protected in a much smaller area surrounding the Bears Ears twin butte formation and another section to the north of what is now a 1.3-million-acre expanse.

The boundary details will be forwarded to Trump later this summer, Zinke said, along with his review of 26 other national monuments. Zinke says legislation will also be proposed so that Congress determines how areas inside national monuments are managed. Bears Ears, for example, also contains wilderness areas inside its boundaries.

The president had asked Zinke in April to review large monuments as part of an effort to increase development on federal lands. Bears Ears is one of two controversial Utah national monuments that drew the ire of Utah lawmakers, who asked Trump to consider rescinding or shrinking them. Bears Ears, created by President Barack Obama last December after several years of negotiations with state and tribal leaders, was singled out by Trump as a “massive federal land grab.” The other is Grand Staircase Escalante, created by President Clinton in 1996, with little public involvement.

Zinke said the Utah delegation and state lawmakers, including Gov. Gary Herbert, support his recommendations. But supporters of Bears Ears existing boundaries expressed disappointment as well as doubts that Trump’s efforts to shrink Bears Ears would survive a court challenge. Randi Spivak, spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group based in Tucson, Arizona, said the recommendation to downsize Bears Ears contradicts the intentions of the Antiquities Act, which enables presidents to set aside federal land for protection and signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. “It’s time for Zinke to stop pretending he’s a Teddy Roosevelt kind of guy,” Spivak said.

Interior to Review Greater Sage Grouse Protection
June 8, 2017

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Wednesday ordered a review of an Obama administration conservation plan to protect the greater sage grouse to determine if that plan interferes with Trump administration efforts to increase energy production on federal lands. The Obama plan was drawn up as an alternative to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decision to list the sage grouse for protection under the Endangered Species Act. The approach, which involved a five-year negotiation between 1,100 ranchers, environmental groups, and state and federal agencies, was hailed as an unprecedented collaboration that had reduced the threat to sage grouse habitat while avoiding a more stringent regulatory intervention that might hinder economic development. Fish and Wildlife declined to list the sage grouse after the collaborative conservation plan was unveiled in 2015.

The sage grouse habitat spans 173 million acres in 11 western states, including the Dakotas, and three Canadian provinces. Before the West was settled, the sage grouse once roamed over 290 million acres. In launching the 60-day review, Zinke said: “While the federal government has a responsibility under the Endangered Species Act to responsibly manage wildlife, destroying local communities and levying onerous regulations on the public lands that they rely on is no way to be a good neighbor.” Rewriting the Obama plan could extend beyond President Trump’s term, when public comment periods, new proposals and legal challenges are taken into account.

U.S. Pulls Out of Paris Climate Agreement
June 1, 2017

President Trump said that he will pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, steering away from a group of 194 other countries that have promised to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The news came just days after he attended the G7 Summit in Italy, where the six other member countries—Germany, Italy, Canada, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom—reaffirmed their commitment to the 2015 climate pact.

As part of the accord, the U.S. had agreed to cut its emissions between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. In abandoning that promise, the U.S. effectively cedes leadership on the issue to other countries, including the world’s top emitter, China. Chinese President Xi Jinping has stood by the agreement in the face of a wavering U.S., calling it a “hard-won achievement” that should be honored. Still, plummeting prices for wind and solar energy and corporations’ support of clean energy are among the reasons why climate progress will likely continue.

Trump Budget Proposes Steep Cuts for the Environment
May 23, 2017

President Trump’s 2018 budget, sent to Congress Tuesday, calls for massive cuts in scientific research and in a slew of environmental programs that protect air and water. The proposed budget, titled “A New Foundation for American Greatness,” slashes the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by 31 percent – a steeper cut than any other agency. Those cuts could translate into a $2.7 billion spending reduction and the loss of 3,200 jobs, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute. The proposed budget eliminates major programs to restore the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, and Puget Sound. It ends the EPA’s lead-risk reduction and radon detection programs and cuts funding for the Superfund cleanup program.

The budget proposal does, however, retain funding for grants and financing to states and cities for drinking water and wastewater programs. S. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, told the Washington Post that he “was amazed” that the final EPA budget is nearly identical to the preliminary budget released in March, despite strong opposition at the time from many members of Congress. In addition, the Interior Department would undergo a 12 percent funding cut, and the Energy Department a six percent cut.

Obama Methane Rule Remains Law of Land
May 10, 2017

In a surprise 51-49 defeat, the U.S. Senate rejects a measure that would have repealed Obama-era regulations on methane emissions. That regulation, which the House of Representatives voted to rescind on February 3, limits the venting and flaring of natural gas from oil and gas facilities on U.S. Bureau of Land Management lands. The Obama administration had argued that the practices wasted tens of billions of cubic feet of natural gas annually—and also posed a climate threat. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with 25 times the warming capacity of carbon dioxide.

EPA Dismisses Science Advisors
May 5, 2017

The EPA dismisses several members of the Board of Scientific Counselors, an 18-member advisory board that reviews the research of EPA scientists. Some of the dismissed scientists had been assured that their three-year terms on the board would be renewed. In a May 7 story by the New York Times, critics assailed the move, casting it as a gift to business interests at the expense of science. An EPA spokesperson said the decision allowed the agency to consider a more diverse pool of applicants, including industry representatives, for the board.

In addition, the Washington Post reported on May 8 that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has started reviewing more than 200 advisory boards and other entities associated with the Interior Department.

EPA Scrubs Climate Change Website
April 28, 2017

The EPA announces that it is reviewing its web content related to climate change. An immediate casualty of the review: the agency’s longtime website devoted to explaining climate change. (The new page, which says it’s being updated “to reflect EPA’s priorities under the leadership of President Trump and Administrator Pruitt,” prominently links to an archived version of the page.) On May 2, 2017, the EPA also purged the Spanish-language version of its climate change web page.

Order Aims to Expand Offshore Drilling
April 28, 2017

President Trump signs an executive order that orders a review of Obama-era bans on offshore oil and gas drilling in parts of the Arctic, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. The Obama policies under review include a five-year oil leasing roadmap that excluded Alaska’s Beaufort and Chukchi Seas and a December 2016 attempt to permanently ban drilling on wide swaths of Arctic and Atlantic waters. NPR reports that the order also halts the designation or expansion of National Marine Sanctuaries, unless the move includes an Interior Department estimate of the area’s “energy or mineral resource potential.” Conservation groups immediately announce their intent to defend Obama’s December 2016 effort in court.

Trump Inner Circle Discusses Paris Agreement
April 27, 2017

Key Trump advisers and Cabinet officials meet to discuss whether the U.S. should stay in the Paris Agreement, according to an April 27 Bloomberg Politics report. The global climate pact was absent from Trump’s March 28 executive order on climate, and debate over whether the U.S. should leave the agreement has divided the White House. Bloomberg Politics and Politico report that Trump is expected to make a final decision on the global climate pact by late May.

Trump Orders Review of National Monuments
April 26, 2017

In a sweeping executive order with few precedents, Trump instructs Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to review as many as 40 national monuments created since 1996 to determine if any of Trump’s three predecessors exceeded their authority when protecting large tracts of already-public land under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The review targets monuments that are at least 100,000 acres in size and reaches back to Utah’s 1.7-million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, which President Bill Clinton created in 1996 in the face of intense opposition. (Read more about the executive order’s potential repercussions.)

Scientists March on Washington
April 22, 2017

On a drizzly Earth Day, thousands of scientists and science enthusiasts march through Washington, D.C., to the U.S. Capitol, voicing support for science’s role in society. The sign-toting crowds—many wearing lab coats and crocheted hats resembling brains—also protest the Trump administration’s environmental and science policies. Satellite events of the March for Science held around the world, more than 600 in all, draw tens of thousands more attendees.

Interior Department Scrubs Climate Change Website
April 19, 2017

An Interior Department official updates the department’s climate change website, deleting much of its content in the process, Motherboard reports. The page now carries a sole mention of “climate change”—and does not explain what the phenomenon is, how it affects the U.S., and what the department is doing about it. (The Interior Department has eight regional Climate Science Centers, which work under the direction of the U.S. Geological Survey “to help resource managers cope with a changing climate,” according to the archived web page.)

Pruitt Calls for Exiting Paris Agreement
April 14, 2017

In an interview on “Fox & Friends,” EPA administrator Scott Pruitt says that he’s personally opposed to the Paris Agreement, the international pact to fight climate change negotiated in 2015. While Pruitt calls the pact “a bad deal for America,” the Trump administration has remained noncommittal on withdrawing from the agreement, reports the Washington Post.

EPA Announces “Back-to-Basics” Agenda
April 13, 2017

With Pennsylvania’s Harvey coal mine as his backdrop, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announces a “back-to-basics” agenda for the environmental agency, which he describes as “protecting the environment by engaging with state, local, and tribal partners to create sensible regulations that enhance economic growth.” The agenda includes reviews of the Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the United States rule, two key Obama-era environmental regulations, as well as promises to clear the backlog of new chemicals awaiting EPA approval. (Read the whole agenda here.)

Climate Change Staffers Reassigned
April 7, 2017

News outlets report that several staff members at EPA’s headquarters who specialized in climate change adaptation have been reassigned. However, an EPA official interviewed by The Hill emphasizes that the agency’s regional offices “have always taken the lead on adaptation and will continue to do so.” An EPA official interviewed by National Geographic says that the staff—four employees in all—will continue at the agency’s Office of Policy, bringing their knowledge to a broader set of issues.

Trump Donates to National Parks
April 3, 2017

The White House announces that President Trump has donated the first quarter of his salary ($78,333.32) to the National Park Service. The gift will reportedly chip away at the $100 to $230 million in deferred maintenance backlogs that the nation’s battlefields currently bear. (The National Park Service’s total deferred maintenance backlog is valued at $12 billion.) Trump’s 2018 budget blueprint calls for a $1.5-billion cut to the U.S. Department of the Interior, to which the National Park Service and its $3.4-billion budget belong. Among other things, the 12-percent cut would eliminate funding for unspecified National Heritage Areas—lived-in, cohesive landscapes deemed by Congress to be nationally important. Several National Heritage Areas contain preserved battlefields.

Scientific Integrity Office Reviewing Pruitt
March 31, 2017

In response to inquiries from the Sierra Club, the EPA’s Office of Inspector General refers Scott Pruitt’s March 9 CNBC interview to the agency’s scientific integrity office for review. In that interview, Pruitt had downplayed carbon emissions’ central role in driving Earth’s changing climate—a position at odds with scientific consensus. EPA spokespeople defend Pruitt, claiming that the administrator is within his right to have a differing opinion. As of April 6, 2017, the Office of Inspector General said that the review had no specified timeframe.

EPA Scientist Retires with a Bang
March 31, 2017

Environmental scientist Michael Cox retires from the EPA after more than 25 years with the agency, penning a scorching farewell letter to agency administrator Scott Pruitt. The letter, which garners significant media coverage, lambasts the Trump administration for “working to dismantle EPA and its staff as quickly as possible.”

Pesticide Avoids Total Ban
March 29, 2017

Against the advice of the EPA’s chemical safety experts, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt rejects a decade-old petition asking that the EPA ban all use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos. In 2000, the EPA banned its use in most household settings, but the pesticide is still used on some 40,000 farms, which EPA scientists recommended stop. Research suggests that chlorpyrifos may be associated with brain damage in children and farm workers, even at low exposures—though Dow Chemical, chlorpyrifos’ manufacturer, argues that it is safe when properly used. The U.S. Department of Agriculture welcomes Pruitt’s decision as helpful for U.S. farmers.

Climate Actions Undone
March 28, 2017

President Trump signs an executive order that seeks to dismantle much of the work on climate change enacted by the Obama administration. The order takes steps to downplay the future costs of carbon emissions, walks back tracking of the federal government’s carbon emissions, rescinds a 2016 moratorium on coal leases on federal lands, and strikes down Obama-era executive orders and memoranda aimed at helping the country prepare for climate change's worst impacts, including threats to national security.

Most notably, the executive order begins the process of rescinding the EPA's Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing power plants. (Read more about the order—and how China may take up global leadership on climate change.)

Dakota Access Pipeline Prepared for Use

Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline, notifies a federal court that it has pumped oil into the pipeline laid underneath North Dakota’s Lake Oahe. The pipeline, which aims to connect North Dakota’s shale oil fields with pipeline networks in Illinois, runs near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and through land promised under the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie but later taken away. The pipeline sparked protests over its potential to contaminate water and damage a sacred tribal site—a movement that grew into the largest Native American protest in recent history. (Meet the defiant “water protectors” of Standing Rock.)

Keystone XL Pipeline Approved
March 24, 2017

The Trump administration’s State Department grants a permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The 1,200-mile pipeline would connect Alberta’s oil sands to refineries in Texas. President Obama had rejected the project in late 2015, amid concerns that the pipeline’s economic benefits were hype—and fears that the pipeline would exacerbate future carbon emissions. In 2014, the U.S. State Department found that the project would increase emissions but no more than other transport methods.

U.S. Bumblebee Officially Listed as Endangered
March 21, 2017

The rusty patched bumblebee (Bombus affinis) officially becomes listed as an endangered species, the first bumblebee and eighth U.S. bee species to receive federal protection. Originally, its listing was to be finalized on February 10—but a January 20 executive order delayed it by over a month, as the Trump administration reviewed Obama-era regulations that hadn’t yet taken effect. (Read more about the bumblebee listing.)

Flint Funding Continued
March 17, 2017

The EPA issues a news release saying that the agency has awarded $100 million to Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality. The money—provided in a law signed by President Obama in December 2016—will fund drinking water infrastructure upgrades in Flint, Michigan, where drinking water remains contaminated with lead. (These intimate portraits of Flint’s citizens reveal their frustration, fear, and perseverance.)

Fuel Efficiency Standards Reconsidered
March 15, 2017

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao announce that the EPA will reconsider the Obama-era emissions requirements for vehicles with model years between 2022 and 2025. The move may presage a rollback of Obama’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, regulations that aim to improve cars’ fuel economy. On January 12, 2017, the Obama EPA attempted to lock in its CAFE standards, which require light-duty vehicles to have average fuel efficiencies of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The Trump administration and automakers have argued that this goal is unachievable.

Science and Environment Budget Threatened
March 13, 2017

The White House releases its first preliminary budget under President Trump. Confirming weeks of speculation, the budget outlines deep cuts to U.S. science and environmental agencies—notably EPA and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—and a vast array of social programs, in an effort to increase defense spending by $54 billion. Congressional and public opposition to the budget crystallizes almost immediately. (Read more about the budget cuts’ potential effects on the environment.)

EPA Chief Downplays Climate
March 9, 2017

In a sharp break with scientific consensus, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt says in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that carbon dioxide’s role in the Earth’s changing climate remains unclear. U.S. and international scientists have repeatedly connected rising carbon emissions to the Earth’s changing climate. A 2014 review by the National Academy of Sciences, the United States’ preeminent scientific advisory body, observed that the Earth’s warming since the 1970s “is mainly a result of the increased concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.”

‘Science’ Scrubbed
March 7, 2017

The New Republic reports that the EPA’s Office of Science and Technology removed the word “science” from its mission statement, based on information provided by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. The updated language, which instead emphasizes ""economically and technologically achievable performance standards,"" marks the latest change to the EPA’s website under Trump, as website updates downplay the Obama administration’s previous climate initiatives.

Emissions Info Request Nixed
March 2, 2017

The EPA withdraws an Obama EPA request for more detailed information on oil and natural-gas facilities. That request, finalized by the Obama administration on November 10, 2016, had aimed to better track the industry’s methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. (Oil and gas facilities are the country’s largest industrial emitters of methane.) The Trump EPA had criticized the rule for its estimated $42-million cost on oil and gas industries.

Federal Lands Won’t Be Unleaded
March 2, 2017

After riding to work on a horse, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke spends his first day on the job rescinding an Obama-era prohibition of lead ammunition on federal lands and waters. The Obama Administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service had issued the ban on January 19, 2017, the day before Trump’s inauguration. The National Rifle Association and hunting groups laud Zinke’s move as supportive of hunting’s economic contribution, while conservation groups decry it, noting that lead ammunition can poison wildlife. (Learn how a ban on lead ammunition could save California’s rare condors.)

Water Protection May Dry Up
February 28, 2017

President Trump issues an executive order formally asking the EPA to review the “Waters of the United States” rule, an Obama-era rule meant to clarify which U.S. waters fall under federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction. The rule had extended federal protections to some headwaters of larger waterways, wetlands, and isolated lakes. (Read more about the controversy surrounding the rule.)

Scott Pruitt Confirmed as EPA Chief
February 17, 2017

The U.S. Senate confirms Scott Pruitt as the head of the U.S. EPA. In his prior role as Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt frequently sued the EPA over its regulations, notably leading a 27-state lawsuit against the Clean Power Plan. Emails released days after Pruitt’s confirmation show that in his time as Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt’s office maintained a cozy relationship with oil and gas companies.

Streams Reopened to Mining Waste
February 16, 2017

President Trump signs a joint resolution passed by Congress revoking the U.S. Department of the Interior’s “Stream Protection Rule.” That rule, finalized shortly before President Obama left office, placed stricter restrictions on dumping mining waste into surrounding waterways. Congressional Republicans characterized the rule as redundant and onerous. (Read “Why Trump Can’t Make Coal Great Again.”)

Fossil Fuel CEO Becomes Chief Diplomat
February 1, 2017

The U.S. Senate confirms ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Tillerson’s extensive ties to fossil fuels—and difficult-to-pin-down stance on climate science—sparked fierce opposition to his nomination among environmentalists. Questions linger over what Tillerson and the Trump administration will do about U.S. involvement in the Paris Agreement, the international climate pact negotiated under the Obama administration.

March for Science Materializes
January 25, 2017

After news that the Trump administration had removed all references to climate change from the White House’s website, online commenters begin calling for a “Scientists’ March on Washington,” styled after the record-breaking Women’s March on January 21. Momentum quickly builds, resulting in plans for the March for Science, scheduled for April 22.

Pipelines Greenlit
January 24, 2017

President Trump issues several memoranda aiming to hasten permitting for the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. Trump also calls for the U.S. Department of Commerce to come up with a plan ensuring that pipelines built across the United States are made with U.S. steel. However, later reports clarify that the memo does not apply to the Keystone XL pipeline.

Park Service #Resists
January 20, 2017

Trump is inaugurated president. Minutes later, the National Park Service posts a photo on Twitter comparing Trump’s crowds with the much larger crowds at Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration. Trump’s subsequent criticism of the National Park Service triggers an unofficial “resistance” movement of social media accounts that claim to be run by U.S. government officials. (Read more about the “science rebellion” blossoming under Trump.)

Scramble to Save Science Data
December 10, 2016

Fearing that the incoming Trump administration may attempt to delete or bury U.S. climate databases, meteorologist and climate journalist Eric Holthaus asks on Twitter for suggestions of important databases to back up. His query sparks a movement across academia to back up key databases, resulting in “data refuges” and the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative.

Trump Takes All
November 8, 2016

Real estate developer Donald Trump wins the 2016 U.S. presidential election. His upset victory comes after a months-long campaign that focused little on environmental issues, but did denounce the Obama administration’s climate policies and champion the U.S. fossil fuels industry."

Late on a gray November afternoon Marvin Atqittuq, a newly elected patrol commander in the Arctic community of Gjoa Haven, stood on the frozen sea outside town and called his troops in for a meeting. A frigid wind flicked snow in from the south, and it was about 20 below zero, cold but not that cold for the Arctic. The company of some 20 Inuit men and a few women gathered around with rifles slung over their shoulders, dressed in hand-sewn jackets of caribou hide or pants made of polar bear fur or wearing the usual store-bought stuff, which was far less warm but namuktuk, good enough for now.

Atqittuq (pronounced At-kee-TUK) pulled on a pair of sealskin gloves and outlined the plan for the day. The group was part of the Canadian Rangers, a reserve component of Canada’s armed forces, and Atqittuq would now lead them on his first mission as their commander: a weeklong patrol by snowmobile down the treeless coast of King William Island. There would be GPS training, military-style target practice, search-and-rescue scenarios, and plenty of hunting and ice fishing.

I stood at the edge of the circle, rubbing ice from my eyelashes. It was too cold to take notes, so I watched faces and read the frostbite scars, little badges of honor that told of lives spent outdoors on one of the planet’s most unyielding landscapes. The group soon broke up and began smoking last cigarettes before the long ride into darkness. Atqittuq walked over to ask whether I was warm enough. He was tall, broad shouldered, laughed easily. He’d been a ranger for many years before the others had voted him their new commander. In a friendly way, he warned me not to fall asleep on the journey ahead.

The mountain pine beetle alone has killed roughly 100,000 square miles of trees across western North America over the past 20 years, from New Mexico all the way up to northern British Columbia. Climate change has instigated this dramatic spread, by eliminating the cold spells that kill off the beetles and by leaving the trees stressed by drought, unable to defend themselves.

And a new study comes with a hefty price tag.

A warming Arctic is shifting from white to dark as sea ice melts and land-covered snow retreats, and that means it can absorb even more of the sun’s heat. Plus, the Arctic’s vast permafrost area is thawing, releasing more heat-trapping carbon and methane. These climate-change-driven feedbacks in the Arctic are accelerating warming even faster and may add nearly $70 trillion to the overall costs of climate change—even if the world meets the Paris Agreement climate targets, a new study says.

However, if efforts can be made to keep climate change limited to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5C), the extra cost of Arctic warming drops to $25 trillion, new research published in Nature Communications reports.

Eight months later, another huge chunk toppled over, and now, five of the giant Sunland stems have collapsed and died, leaving only half of the tree standing.

In South Africa’s Limpopo province, a baobab tree once grew so large and stood so strong that its human neighbors decided to do the obvious: They built a pub inside the living tree’s thousand-year-old hollow trunk, which measured more than 150 feet around and enclosed two interconnected cavities.

For two decades, the Sunland baobab attracted tourists wanting to knock back a pint in a tree. But in August 2016, one of the monster stems forming the interior wall cracked and collapsed. Eight months later, another huge chunk toppled over, and now, five of the giant Sunland stems have collapsed and died, leaving only half of the tree standing.

With his 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, former U.S. vice president Al Gore drew public attention to the threat of climate change. This July, An Inconvenient Sequel opens in theaters. Gore, 69, says the stakes are higher now but the solutions are clearer.

What do you think the public misunderstands about climate change?

I think the overwhelming majority of the public understands very well that climate change is an extremely important challenge, that human beings are responsible for it, and that we need to act quickly and decisively to solve it. The most persuasive arguments have come from Mother Nature. Climate-related extreme weather events are now so numerous and severe that it’s hard to dismiss what’s happening. But even those who don’t want to use the words “global warming” or “climate crisis” are finding other ways to say, “Yes, we’ve got to move on solar, wind, batteries, electric cars, and so on.” We have so much at risk.

Why have such sharp political divisions emerged over climate change?

There’s an old saying in Tennessee: If you see a turtle on the top of a fence post, you can be pretty sure it didn’t get there on its own. A determined minority—with active financial support from a few large carbon polluters—has held up progress for quite a while. They have used lobbying power and the threat of financing primary opponents, using the same techniques we saw in the past with Big Tobacco to falsely create doubt. All of us are vulnerable to what psychologists call denial: If something is uncomfortable, it’s easier to push it away, to not engage. But the solution is to listen and approach people on the basis of where they are.

You’ve publically called the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change “a reckless and indefensible action.” Where do we go from here?

Even if Trump succeeds in eliminating measures that will help the U.S. reduce emissions, developments in the marketplace—with the cost of renewable electricity continuing to plummet—mean that the U.S. could meet our Paris goals in spite of what Trump does. California and New York are moving much faster than the Clean Power Plan requires. A growing number of cities are moving even faster. And the business community is way ahead of the political community, with many consumer-facing companies pledging to go 100 percent renewable energy.

What about China’s role?

China is moving in a very impressive way. We are into the fourth year of carbon dioxide emission reductions by that country, and the third year of declining coal use.

All spent nuclear fuel in the U.S. will soon end up in one place,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/new-mexico-nuclear-waste-storage,07-30-2019,"Some officials and locals worry about the dangers of storing spent nuclear fuel rods on 1,000 acres in remote New Mexico, but plans march forward for 2020.","Nuclear power is sometimes touted as a solution to looming climate catastrophe: Reliable on cloudy and windless days, it produces electricity without releasing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, at least once power plants are up and running. While the world looks to shift away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, global demand continues to climb.

Nuclear fission currently generates about 11 percent of electricity worldwide every year, and 20 percent in the United States. Proponents of nuclear believe it is uniquely able to be scaled up quickly and reliably enough to displace fossil fuels and meet the world’s growing energy demands.

But nuclear energy means nuclear waste, a problem in search of a solution for decades that remains as vexing as ever. Nuclear utilities in the United States—60 plants in 30 states, as of December 2018—mostly store their spent fuel rods on site, distributing the risk of contamination and leakage around the nation. In 1987 the federal government proposed Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada, as a permanent centralized repository for such nuclear waste. But sustained in-state resistance led to delays in the site’s development, and the Obama administration mothballed the project in 2009. Nuclear power is sometimes touted as a solution to looming climate catastrophe: Reliable on cloudy and windless days, it produces electricity without releasing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, at least once power plants are up and running. While the world looks to shift away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, global demand continues to climb.

Nuclear fission currently generates about 11 percent of electricity worldwide every year, and 20 percent in the United States. Proponents of nuclear believe it is uniquely able to be scaled up quickly and reliably enough to displace fossil fuels and meet the world’s growing energy demands.

But nuclear energy means nuclear waste, a problem in search of a solution for decades that remains as vexing as ever.

Americans want more renewable energy. Can ‘community choice’ help them get it?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/americans-want-more-renewable-energy-can-community-choice-help-them-get-it,04-20-2021,"Frustrated by slow uptake of renewable power sources, some communities are taking their power needs into their own hands.","The problem, as Dawn Weisz saw it back in the mid-2000s, was straightforward. She and other residents of Marin County wanted green power. But only 16 percent of the electricity that PG&E, the local utility, was delivering to its 250,000 customers was renewable.

Frustratingly, Weisz and other community members didn’t have any say about what went into that mix. The county government—for which Weisz worked at the time—had set ambitious decarbonization goals and had found that cleaning up their power supply would be the best first step forward. But they couldn’t force the utility to go green any faster.

So she and others organized to form a “community choice aggregator,” or CCA—a nonprofit that took over buying electricity for Marin from a variety of producers. Within a year they were providing 50 percent renewable power to nearly everyone in the county. Today, 10 years after its founding, Marin Clean Energy, (now known as MCE since they serve more than just Marin),  has expanded to cover more than a million people and provides just over 60 percent renewable power.

How can insects turn colors they can’t see?

Peppered moths are masters of camouflage. In the larval stage, they can change the color of their skin to blend into their settings—even without seeing those surroundings, a new study found. After raising more than 300 peppered moth larvae, U.K. researchers obscured the vision of some with black paint (which the larvae later shed, unharmed). The larvae were placed in boxes containing white, green, brown, or black sticks, and given time to adapt. When the researchers opened the boxes, they found that nearly all the caterpillars, with or without vision, had changed their body colors to match the sticks in their box. The researchers then moved the caterpillars into new boxes containing sticks of two different colors, and about 80 percent of the insects chose to rest on sticks that matched their body color. The researchers say their findings provide strong evidence that peppered moth larvae are capable of dermal photoreception—seeing with their skin. —Annie Roth

Whether or not their eyes could see, caterpillars in a study generally mimicked the colors of the sticks that they perched on.

Cement of the future?

The process for making cement creates so much greenhouse gas that if it were a country, it’d be the third largest emitter on Earth. That statistic is from MIT, where scientists devised a process that would produce cement using electricity, rather than by burning fossil fuels. In a water electrolyzer, current to the electrodes creates hydrogen and oxygen gases, an acid, and a base. When limestone is added to the acid, it’s dissolved and decarbonated—loses its CO2—and then can be used to make a key cement ingredient. —AR

Scientists at MIT have devised a way to use an electrolyzer to create cement without generating large amounts of greenhouse gases, as the traditional cement production process does.

On a rural highway in Northern California, a July traveler’s tire went flat. Metal rim scraped against pavement. The sparks ignited a fire that ripped through dry forest, whirled into flame tornadoes, and roared over tens of thousands of acres, making fuel of everything in its path. When it jumped the Sacramento River and headed for the city of Redding, Keith Bein prepped his new rig—a trailer holding two tiny electric cars, a lot of tubes and instrumentation, and a white contraption that looks like a miniature lighthouse. 

Bein works as an atmospheric scientist at the University of California, Davis campus, about 150 miles south of Redding. By the time he hooked the loaded trailer to his truck and began driving upstate, the 2018 Carr Fire—those sparks ignited near a power plant called Carr—was already one of the biggest wildfires in California history. It had killed six people, including two firefighters. It was burning trees, grasslands, mountain cabins, pedestrian bridges, light posts, fences, parked cars. At the Redding outskirts it had just burned a suburb called Lake Keswick Estates, which meant the full infrastructure of single-family housing: insulation, shingles, refrigerators, paint. 

And everywhere around the Carr Fire’s great trajectory was smoke—billowing, blanketing, spreading thousands of miles beyond the actual flames. Of all the things that foul the air we breathe, it’s wildfire smoke that most fascinates Bein. 

He wants to understand exactly what’s in it, how its chemistry differs from one fire to the next, and what this century’s unprecedented megafires mean for global air pollution and human health. In western North America and in Australia, as measured by the size and number of wildland fires, 2018 was the worst year in recorded history—until 2020 eclipsed it.

I go there to be in the snow, to be near the stars, to be close to the moon. I go there to see the first ray of the sun at dawn, to wait with great devotion, to return purified. Up there, we are reborn.” At night, believers would use the reflection from the moon that cascaded atop snow-capped peaks as a guide to make their way up the sacred Colque Punku glacier.

Angkor Wat’s Collapse From Climate Change Has Lessons for Today,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/angkor-wat-civilization-collapsed-floods-drought-climate-change,04-05-2017,"The powerful civilization was hammered into oblivion by drought and floods, underscoring the connections between climate and people.","ANGKOR, CAMBODIA — Next to the road leading into Angkor Thom—one of the walled cities that make up Angkor, the ancient Khmer empire in Cambodia—stands a solitary but crumbling bridge with corbeled arches made out of recycled sandstone blocks. The bridge seems to be of little significance; no water runs beneath it. Few, if any, of the tour buses shuttling visitors to the temple grounds every day stop for tourists to have a look.

But to Dan Penny, an expert in environmental history who has studied the Angkor civilization for many years, the bridge tells an intriguing story. Its damage in the recent past, he says, is a reminder that while it was water—or the control of it—that built the city of Angkor, it was also water that helped destroy it.

The cause of the Angkor empire’s demise in the early 15th century long remained a mystery. But researchers have now shown that intense monsoon rains that followed a prolonged drought in the region caused widespread damage to the city’s infrastructure, leading to its collapse.

One reason, according to new research published Thursday in Scientific Reports: Muskoxen eat most of the year by pawing through snow with their hooves. But rising temperatures mean precipitation increasingly falls as rain, only to then freeze on the surface, encasing plant life in inaccessible ice.

Meanwhile, in a type of freak weather event likely to become more common, more than 50 muskoxen died swamped in ice, as gusts of howling winds drove ice and freezing waters from a tidal surge so far inland that fish were found a half-mile from shore.

Answers to these botanical mysteries could help a climate-stressed world,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/answers-to-these-botanical-mysteries-could-help-a-climate-stressed-world,06-15-2021,The unparalleled genetic diversity found at critical crops’ origin sites can help breeders create drought and heat-resilient varieties.,"Whether you’re munching spicy kimchi on a Seoul street corner, tucking into a hearty turnip stew to get through a northern European winter, or enjoying crispy collards in a Southern soul food joint, your meal is anchored by one of just two species: Brassica rapa or Brassica oleracea. Eat anything fried in canola oil, as millions do daily, and you're benefiting from a hybrid between the two: Brassica napus.

For over a century, scientists have puzzled over the origin stories of these globally important food plants. Now, researchers have analyzed DNA from hundreds of wild brassicas around the world and declared the mysteries solved: Brassica rapa—cultivated as turnips, bok choi, napa cabbage, and more—came from mountains near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, and Brassica oleracea—better known as broccoli, cauliflower, collards, kale, and Brussels sprouts, among others—originated in the eastern Mediterranean.

The findings should set off immediate efforts to collect and conserve plants from these regions, researchers say. As the world speeds toward a hotter, more volatile future, crops such as brassicas—as well as corn, wheat, and other crops that underpin global food security—could face unprecedented challenges from heat, drought, and disease.

During February, temperatures skyrocketed to a wild winter high more than 45 degrees above normal in some areas, sending the North Pole—in the dead of winter, when the region is shrouded in darkness—above freezing for several days. Massive sections of Greenland, normally blanketed by thick, old ice, experienced open water for the first time on record.

Sergey Zimov, right, and his son, Nikita, run an Arctic research station in Cherskiy, Russia, along the Kolyma River. The elder Zimov first figured out that permafrost stores far more carbon than scientists once thought. Some of it is now escaping as temperatures rise.

Sergey Zimov, an ecologist by training, tossed a woolly mammoth bone on the pile. He was squatting in mud along the cool, wide Kolyma River, below a towering cliff of crumbling earth. It was summer in eastern Siberia, far above the Arctic Circle, in that part of Russia that’s closer to Alaska than to Moscow. There wasn’t a speck of frost or snow in sight. Yet at this cliff, called Duvanny Yar, the Kolyma had chewed through and exposed what lies beneath: a layer of frozen ground, or permafrost, that is hundreds of feet deep—and warming fast.

Twigs, other plant matter, and Ice Age animal parts—bison jaws, horse femurs, mammoth bones—spilled onto a beach that sucked at Zimov’s boots. “I love Duvanny Yar,” he said as he yanked fossils from the muck. “It is like a book. Each page is a story about the history of nature.”

Across nine million square miles at the top of the planet, climate change is writing a new chapter. Arctic permafrost isn’t thawing gradually, as scientists once predicted. Geologically speaking, it’s thawing almost overnight. As soils like the ones at Duvanny Yar soften and slump, they’re releasing vestiges of ancient life—and masses of carbon—that have been locked in frozen dirt for millennia. Entering the atmosphere as methane or carbon dioxide, the carbon promises to accelerate climate change, even as humans struggle to curb our fossil fuel emissions.

Arctic's 'Penguins of the North' Find Workaround to Climate Change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/150112-little-auks-global-warming-climate-change-environment,01-13-2015,Scientists warn that climate change is disrupting Arctic ecology in unpredictable ways.,"What's New: The latest research on little auks, sometimes called ""penguins of the north,"" reveals a surprising response to a rapidly warming Arctic: The birds make up for food lost to the effects of climate change by catching prey that were stunned by the cold water running off melting glaciers—another effect of climate change.

The study, published Monday in the journal Global Change Biology, is the first to examine the feeding habits of little auks as Arctic ice is lost. Scientists watched the birds in Franz-Josef Land, off the northern coast of Russia, during an expedition supported by the National Geographic Society.

Since 2005, the auks' water has become essentially ice-free in summer, reducing the numbers of tiny animals known as zooplankton, a key food source for the auks. Zooplankton normally congregated around sea ice, but now the birds have shifted to eating zooplankton that are stunned—and thus easier to catch—by cold water running off glaciers melting on land.

Some people ran toward the ocean, plunging into the water to save themselves from the flames onshore. Others tried to shelter in buildings or cars.

The people of Lennox Island are some of the first to see their land washed away by rising seas—and they’re responding with urgency and ingenuity. 

LENNOX ISLAND, CANADA — Wearing clean white cotton gloves, Gilbert Sark carefully unwraps papers containing artifacts from his ancestors. An eel spear. An arrowhead. A flint. Many of these ancient treasures, now housed at this aboriginal community’s cultural center, have been collected from the beaches, where the dissolving coastline scatters them on the sand.  

A house on Lennox Island off Canada’s Atlantic coast sits so close to the shoreline that its occupant, Dave Haley, worries that storms and erosion will sweep it out to sea. During a severe storm five years ago, the water lapped at his door. “Today our high tides have become almost like a storm tide. The water is higher, our low tides have become like our regular high tides, so things have changed,” he says.

“When our artifacts start popping up on the shore because of erosion, I ask myself: ‘What’s one of the major things erosion comes from?’ Higher water table, high storms. And where does that come from? Global warming,” says Sark, who, at 36, is considered an elder of this community.

The Mi’kmaq, among the original inhabitants of Canada’s Atlantic provinces, have lived on Lennox Island, slightly north of Prince Edward Island, for thousands of years. Shaped and sustained by the rhythms of the sea, the island’s low-lying sweep of red sand is now being swallowed up by the cold waters of Malpeque Bay. Along with it, the island’s archaeological record is being swept away. Update, Feb. 23, 2016: Sea level is rising faster now than at any time in the past 2,800 years , according to research released this week . The people of Lennox Island are some of the first to see their land washed away by rising seas—and they’re responding with urgency and ingenuity. 

LENNOX ISLAND, CANADA — Wearing clean white cotton gloves, Gilbert Sark carefully unwraps papers containing artifacts from his ancestors. An eel spear. An arrowhead. A flint. Many of these ancient treasures, now housed at this aboriginal community’s cultural center, have been collected from the beaches, where the dissolving coastline scatters them on the sand.  

A house on Lennox Island off Canada’s Atlantic coast sits so close to the shoreline that its occupant, Dave Haley, worries that storms and erosion will sweep it out to sea. During a severe storm five years ago, the water lapped at his door. “Today our high tides have become almost like a storm tide. The water is higher, our low tides have become like our regular high tides, so things have changed,” he says.

“When our artifacts start popping up on the shore because of erosion, I ask myself: ‘What’s one of the major things erosion comes from?’ Higher water table, high storms. And where does that come from? Global warming,” says Sark, who, at 36, is considered an elder of this community.

Read the optimistic argument and the rest of our stories here.

As coal mines spread like cracks across Australia’s Hunter Valley, the phone in Glenn Albrecht’s office began to ring. It was the early 2000s, and Albrecht, an environmental studies professor, was interested in the emotional impacts of mining on local communities. For generations, the region had been known for its bucolic alfalfa fields, horse farms, and vineyards. Coal mining had long been a part of the economy, but it had suddenly grown as increasing global demand and new extraction technologies prompted a wave of new mining operations across the valley.

Word of Albrecht’s interest spread, and distressed residents were eager to share their stories. They described earth-shaking explosions, the constant rumble of machinery, the eerie glow of industrial work lights that illuminated the night, and invasive black dust that coated their houses inside and out. They worried about the air they breathed and the water they drank. Their homes were slipping away, and they felt powerless to stop the destruction.

It’s a sobering example of how U.S. animal rescue organizations are feeling the pressure as climate change supercharges wildfires, hurricanes, storms, and other forms of extreme weather.

In the U.S., hurricanes create an increased demand for housing displaced dogs, and wildfires lead to higher cat euthanasia rates, according to 2022 research. There are roughly 50,000 animal welfare organizations in the country, many of which rescue—and attempt to reunite with their owners—dogs, cats, and other pets impacted by natural disasters.

For a couple of years I was living on the south coast of Iceland, and one day, a man knocked on the door of my home.

He asked if I wanted to see something. No adjectives. Just, did I want to see something?

I almost didn’t hear his knock. My house was on the extreme southeastern coast of the island—literally twenty feet from the sea—and strong winds were bashing the concrete walls and making the tin roof shriek with each gust.

I considered. It was cold, the wintery light was growing dim, I was a foreigner in the area, and if I went missing, no one would go looking for me for days. But then again, it was Iceland, one of the safest places in the world. And my curiosity was piqued.

I agreed and grabbed my nine-hundred-fill down jacket, gloves, and a hat. I ran outside and stepped high up into his Icelandic super jeep—the type that requires a little ladder to climb into the cab—and we drove slowly through the orderly, windblown streets of the village of Höfn.

Höfn [pronounced Hhh-Uphn], my home for several months by that point, is a small, low-lying village of about seventeen hundred people built on a jagged spur of land jutting south off the island’s coast like a hitchhiker’s thumb. Höfn is the primary village within the Municipality of Hornafjörður, a 127-mile-long region encompassing a swath of Iceland’s southeastern coast.

Matching glacial lagoons fan out east and west on either side of Höfn, resembling murky butterfly wings from the air. Directly south, the storm-laden North Atlantic Ocean edges the town, and to the north, glaciers pour down out of the encircling coastal mountains. Höfn—and all of Hornafjörður—is Iceland’s glacier central.

And those glaciers are rapidly disappearing—not just in Iceland, but all around the world. That’s why as a geographer and glaciologist I was living in such a remote place. But what I was learning was about much more than rising temperatures and receding ice. As glaciers retreat they are altering the human story in profound ways, and I was about to get a front-row seat.

Frigid vigil


A lone road led north out of Höfn and connected to Hringvegurinn, the Ring Road, the single highway encircling the entire island. We drove for an hour west on the Hringvegurinn, then turned off the road and parked at a random moss-covered pull-off. This article was created in partnership with the National Geographic Society.

KATIE ARMSTRONG, NG MAPS. SOURCE: NATIONAL SNOW AND ICE DATA CENTERTwo years ago, Cottier and a team of scientist traveled to the Arctic in the middle of winter to study how light affects the marine critters living in far northern waters. Like us, marine organisms rely on light to guide their daily functions. Light indicates behavior like when to migrate through the water column to find food, when to mate, and where to hunt. The Arctic Circle in the middle of winter is so dark it's hard to see. Because of the way the top of the Earth tilts away from the sun, the star never appears to rise above the horizon, and dark skies drench the Arctic in what’s known as polar night.“It kind of feels like you’re working the night shift all the time,” says Finlo Cottier, an oceanographer at the Scottish Association for Marine Science.

DEMAK REGENCY, INDONESIA — Indonesian photographer Aji Styawan spent more than four years covering the sinking coast of Demak Regency, in Central Java, for his feature in the July issue of National Geographic magazine. During that time, he visited the village of Timbulsloko, which is not far from his own home, dozens of times. Groundwater extraction is causing the coast in Demak Regency to sink rapidly, even as climate change is causing the sea to rise, and to Styawan, the Timbulsloko community cemetery was a particularly poignant illustration of this situation. It flooded regularly at high tide, making it impossible for residents to visit or bury their dead.

Then in September of last year, the villagers managed to raise the cemetery by about five feet. A government backhoe scraped the necessary mud from the surrounding seafloor, but the villagers did most of the work themselves by hand—removing and later replacing the headstones, leveling the freshly piled mud, and building a bamboo fence to keep it in place. They wanted to preserve their connection to their past and the sweet memories of their ancestors for a little while longer.

“For me personally, I am always stunned because when they are alive, the people are living with the seawater around them even inside their homes,” Styawan wrote in an email at the time. “When they die, they will be buried below sea level. Even though the cemetery has been raised up, still the holes that they dig will have seawater inside.” This story was produced and published by National Geographic through a reporting partnership with the United Nations Development Programme.

Classic beaver behavior, which every third grader can identify, is building dams. By doing this, they create ponds and wetlands that turn out to be important for many reasons. The first is biodiversity habitat, providing places to live for fish and wildlife. In the American West, where things are pretty dry, wetlands cover just 2 percent of the total land area, but support about 80 percent of the biodiversity. Any creature capable of creating wetlands becomes immensely important. Imagine being a frog that breeds in a pond, a juvenile salmon that grows up in one, or a duck that nests near one. The number of species that depend on these beaver habitats is virtually limitless.

Classic beaver behavior, which every third grader can identify, is building dams. By doing this, they create ponds and wetlands that turn out to be important for many reasons. The first is biodiversity habitat, providing places to live for fish and wildlife. In the American West, where things are pretty dry, wetlands cover just 2 percent of the total land area, but support about 80 percent of the biodiversity. Any creature capable of creating wetlands becomes immensely important. Imagine being a frog that breeds in a pond, a juvenile salmon that grows up in one, or a duck that nests near one. The number of species that depend on these beaver habitats is virtually limitless."

Where globe mallow plants bloom in the western United States, you’ll often find a species of bee that shares the plant’s name and taps it for food. Nature photographers Joe and Niccole Neely were walking in an Arizona field when they saw the bees’ other use for the blooms: as crash pads. Globe mallow bees don’t make hives; females sleep in ground nests, males on plants. Near sunset, the Neelys saw bees enter one flower after another. “They’d just kind of crawl in and plop over,” Joe says.

Who was ‘dragon man’?

Nearly 90 years after it was hidden at the bottom of an abandoned well, a stunningly preserved skull is getting its day in the sun. The artifact may represent a new human species: Homo longi, aka “dragon man” (reconstruction below). At least 146,000 years old, the cranium sports a mash-up of ancient and modern features that show it’s closely related to us—even more so than Neanderthals, some researchers say. “I’ve held a lot of other human skulls and fossils, but never like this,” says study co-author Xijun Ni, a paleoanthropologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Yet dragon man is stirring debate, with some experts suggesting it could be a Denisovan, a mysterious Neanderthal sister group represented by scant fossils. No matter its identity, the skull underscores just how tangled the branches are in our human family tree. —Maya Wei-Haas

Dragon man, as depicted in this reconstruction, lived more than 146,000 years ago in a chilly region in northeastern China.

This week, in a 7-2 vote, its City Council approved a draft ordinance that would require warning labels at fueling stations, even electric-charging ones. The labels would link driving to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Their message: a car’s burning of  fossil fuels hurts the planet.

“These labels are analogous to the health warnings placed on cigarettes,” Max Gomberg, chairman of the the city’s Community Environmental Advisory Commission, wrote in a memo that notes his group got the idea from the non-profit environmental activist group 350.org.

Arctic temperatures gripped the continent for weeks; snow fell as far south as Rome. In the British Isles, early March blizzards produced 25-foot snow drifts.

New research suggests that this astonishing cold wave, dubbed the Beast from the East, was supercharged with snow thanks in part to a dearth of sea ice in the Barents Sea, off the Arctic coasts of Norway and Russia. It points to a different and poorly studied way in which declining Arctic sea ice can impact the weather further south—distinct from the meandering jet stream phenomenon that has gotten so much press.

The study, published Thursday in Nature Geoscience, used isotopic matching, satellite data, and models to trace the origins of the snow that fell during the Beast from the East. The authors found that up to 88 percent of it, or 140 billion tons of snow, might have originated from evaporation at the surface of the Barents Sea, where levels of sea ice were unusually low that year.

In fact, the world’s leaders are debating what to do about it this week in Paris. It’s true Earth’s climate has changed through time naturally due to slight changes in the planet’s orbit, Nye notes, “but climate change as we know it today is characterized by an abrupt increase in the Earth’s temperature.”

That’s 1.2 to 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer over the past century. Ten of the last 13 years were the warmest on record (including this year, according to a recent report). And 97 percent of climate scientists think this warming has been caused by human activity, Nye says.

Changes in rainfall patterns can turn a species-rich tropical forest into a species-poor grassland in less than a decade, said lead author Jos Barlow from England’s Lancaster University. “The most alarming finding is that we are losing tropical ecosystems in some regions,” he said.

California Fires Keep Burning. What Does It Take to Stop Them?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/news-california-carr-fire-firefighters-on-assignment,08-16-2018,More humans plus drier weather equals more fires.,"Mark Thiessen is a National Geographic photographer and a certified wildland photographer. He has shot on the front lines of fires for more than a decade. Photographer Stuart Palley has photographed more than 60 wildfires in California and has formal wildfire training.

When you read about a monstrous wildfire like California’s Carr fire growing to over 190,000 acres, burning up over 1,000 homes and killing eight people, it’s strange to think that it began the size of a dinner plate. The fire (named for where it started: Carr Powerhouse Road) that grew into one of the biggest fires in California history, was sparked by a flat tire. A tire on a car traveling fast can shred and leave the car riding on the metal rim, throwing sparks as it rolls over asphalt. That’s what happened: A startled driver pulled over on the shoulder, causing dry grass to catch on fire.

If that same tire had blown out on a cooler, more humid day, or even in the morning when there was dew on the grass, it probably would have been a non-event, just another broken down car on the side of the road. Maybe the grass would have begun to smolder a bit, but easily could have been stomped out. But this occurred on a 105-degree afternoon with 20 percent humidity, the right conditions just waiting for a spark.

Every fire starts out small. I once saw Bureau of Land Management fire crews in Boise, Idaho, nearly corral a two-acre fire started by tracer rounds at a gun range, only to lose control of it when the winds picked up and a fire engine at a crucial point broke an axel. Several hours later, the small burn had spread to 15,000 acres and was running into the woods, where even more fuel awaited.

For three decades, before and after big storms, Marks has been bombarded with imaginative ideas on how to weaken or destroy them: Why don’t we nuke them? Or drag icebergs into their path? Or cover the sea with some kind of film to stop the evaporation that feeds their intensity?

So far, says Marks, none of the proposals, whether from inventors in their garages or Ph.D. physicists in their labs, “has come close to capturing the complexity of hurricanes – or the risks” of meddling with one."

Encroaching seas? Check. Heat waves? Those, too. Stressing the water system, the transportation system, and more? Yup, that too.

It was clear to Bloomberg that the problem wasn’t going to go away. It was also clear that the federal government wasn’t going to do enough meaningful to address the problem, he says.

But Bloomberg realized that New York and other cities didn’t have to wait: They could take their future into their own hands. And in making themselves more sustainable and resilient to onrushing climate change, cities could also make a serious dent in global carbon emissions, because so much of the world’s population lives in urban areas—meaning that the choices that cities make impact the entire world.

My wife took me fly fishing on our first date. I’d spent my adult life in the mountains, huffing up lupine trails and clambering over granite boulders, eager to gulp that high-country air. But I’d never tossed a drake or a tiny blue wing olive into a riffle on a bend in a mountain stream. This woman had, and it had transformed her.

As the icy Snake River pushed against my knees, and the hot southern Idaho sun baked my shoulders, fishing began to change me, too. My future partner showed me the little cases that caddisfly larvae build on stones. She taught me to spot barely perceptible shifts in current and to tell the difference between whitefish and cutthroat trout just by the way each tugged on my line. Over the next 20 years, we’d spend hundreds of hours on the water, in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington. We fished across Canada and alongside bears in Alaska. I started seeing rivers and mountain ecosystems through new eyes. You could say I’d fallen in love twice.

So, I felt a sharp pang when writer Christopher Solomon detailed all the ways climate change may spell doom for many freshwater fish. As winters warm and snows come less often, rivers grow too thin and hot for species like trout and steelhead, which need rushing frigid currents. Some die outright, while others grow more susceptible to disease. The bugs they eat are disappearing, too, and native species are hybridizing with others. (Pictured above, fly-fishing guide Hilary Hutcheson with her family; below, a distinctive westslope cutthroat trout, Montana’s official state fish, which is threatened by hybridization.)

Freshwater fish went extinct twice as fast as other vertebrates in the 20th century. Forty percent of North American inland fish are still imperiled. Brook trout in Virginia are retreating higher into the Shenandoahs and may keep doing so until they’re gone. Brook trout in Wisconsin are expected to vanish from 70 percent of their waters before my teenage daughter is my age.

This type of loss is insignificant in the face of deadly wildfires, menacing heat waves, more powerful hurricanes and extended drought. A less diverse array of fish species will persist, and there are small signs of hope. Planting more trees could shade and cool water, for example. But, as Solomon writes, 700 million people around the world fish, and these shifts are a reminder that climate change is remaking the world in subtler ways, too, altering how “we move through our daily lives.”

The gases absorb solar energy and keep heat close to Earth's surface, rather than letting it escape into space. That trapping of heat is known as the greenhouse effect.

These square-meter-sized plots first mapped in 1916 by botanist William Skinner Cooper were central to one of the longest-running natural experiments in science, and to our understanding one of the most-studied and dynamic places in the country.

Cooper knew the rich history of Glacier Bay, had read the expedition diaries of Capt. George Vancouver from the 18th century, had followed naturalist John Muir's canoe trips, when Muir compared its geology to Yosemite Valley's. Cooper even had led the charge to have the region declared a national monument, 55 years before it became a national park in 1980. It's not often an ecologist gets to play sleuth in so adventurous a fashion—picking through musty papers in the Midwest for 100-year-old hand-drawn maps that lead through dense Alaskan underbrush populated by wolves and brown bears.

Chameleon Mummified Alive by the Tropical Sun,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/mummies-chameleons-climate-change-reptiles,06-20-2017,"Even reptiles adapted to hot environments can succumb to heat stress, a concern as the world warms, experts say.","Death by desiccation may be unpleasant, but it makes for a lovely corpse.

Such was the fate of an unlucky Indian chameleon that apparently died while trying to drink from a pipe that had been turned off. Writer and wildlife filmmaker Janaki Lenin witnessed the macabre scene recently in India.

According to Lenin’s posts, it seems the reptile expired while clutching the spigot, and was then quickly mummified by the intense tropical sun. Two tiny holes cut into the dried remains suggest that ants may have helped themselves to the animal's innards, completing the preservation process.

The automaker’s purchase of carbon credits is helping to prevent 11,000 acres of prairies from becoming cropland. The idea is to fight climate change through conservation—the tillage of land for crops releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but protected grassland sequesters carbon by capturing it from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil. The credits Chevrolet purchased from North Dakota landowners, for example, are equivalent to almost 40,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

“The idea behind this project is to create a market that rewards landowners for stewardship, where they’re not just producing agricultural products but producing environmental benefits,” said Robert Bonnie, the USDA Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment.

He does not mean this as a boast but rather a simple acknowledgment of service. The 46-year-old park ranger slowly lowers himself until he is on one knee. In quiet tones he asks the glacier for permission to lead us onto the secluded ice.

We’re at the approach to the Exploradores Glacier, situated in southern Chile’s Laguna San Rafael National Park. It’s early September, a season of less rain and fewer tourists. Swollen gray clouds loom over us as the dense forest recedes. We strap crampons onto our hiking boots and crunch our way through a terrain of slick morainal sediment that suddenly cascades into a swirling panorama of pale blue ice massifs and minty glacial waterways. The primordial might of Exploradores must be respected, even by someone like Carretta who visits the glacier on foot daily, often spending evenings at its edge in a firelit cabin bedroom where he dines on canned food. As a new visitor, I find the glacier beautiful but also terrifying, as with any indomitable force. “I am the guardian of the glacier,” says Andrea Carretta.

That work was aimed at helping the United States meet its carbon emissions targets in the landmark Paris climate agreement.

Trump's order begins the process of rescinding the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation of U.S. power plant emissions. It also takes steps to downplay the future costs of carbon emissions, walks back tracking of the federal government’s carbon emissions, rescinds a 2016 moratorium on coal leases on federal lands, and strikes down Obama-era executive orders and memoranda aimed at helping the country prepare for climate change's worst impacts, including its threats to national security.

In short, yes,” says Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a coalition of pro-coal energy companies. “The executive order is focused around reliable and affordable baseload power production, and policies which stress baseload production will continue to have a role for coal.” China may soon fill the leadership vacuum that President Donald Trump leaves on the world stage as he is expected to sign a new executive order Tuesday that seeks to dismantle much of the work on climate change enacted by his predecessor.

To help make this work more accessible to the public, in late October, photographer Mario Tama flew on three of NASA's IceBridge flights over Western Antarctica and the surrounding sea ice, leaving out of Punta Arenas, Chile. The trip was timed to coincide with the start of the melt season (spring) in the Southern Hemisphere.

Climate Change Is Making Your Allergies Even Worse,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/160408-pollen-climate-change-allergies-spring-seasons,04-08-2016,Why does pollen make some people sneeze? Will eating honey help with your allergies? And what’s the heat got to do with it?,"When one tree loves another tree very much, it releases pollen to fertilize the ovules of that tree, plus whatever other trees happen to be around (you know how it goes). But when the pollen begins to blow, you’re probably not marveling at the miracle of tree reproduction—you’re dreading the allergies that accompany it.

The reason that pollen makes some people sniffle and sneeze is because their immune systems attack it like a parasite, says Leonard Bielory, professor and allergy specialist at Rutgers University Center of Environmental Prediction.

That’s because certain people’s immune systems recognize the protein sequence in pollen as similar to the protein sequence in parasites. When this happens, their bodies attempt to expel the “parasite” through sneezing and other symptoms. This attack on the pollen, Bielory says, “is the reaction we call allergy.” When one tree loves another tree very much, it releases pollen to fertilize the ovules of that tree, plus whatever other trees happen to be around (you know how it goes).

Yes, but with a slight caveat: Earth's northern pole is drifting rapidly eastward, and it looks like climate change is to blame. The discovery may have major implications for studies of ice loss and drought, potentially improving our ability to predict such changes in the future.

Earth turns around an axis like a giant spinning top. The places where that invisible axis intersects with the planet's surface are the north and south rotational poles. Due to Earth's wobble on its axis, these spots drift in roughly decade-long cycles. (All this motion is a completely separate mechanism from the behavior of the planet's magnetic poles, which also reverse periodically over the course of millions of years.)

Scientists pinpoint the geographic north and south poles by taking the long-term averages of those rotational positions. Finding the North Pole means traveling north, right?

Vibrio is probably little known to most Americans, though it has caused major outbreaks in European coastal cities. But the bacteria is what lies behind the old advice to only eat oysters in months with an r in the name—that is, not in summer. Vibrio burgeons in warmer water. It collects in shellfish such as oysters when they filter water while feeding and then makes people ill when they eat the shellfish raw.

Vibrio is probably little known to most Americans, though it has caused major outbreaks in European coastal cities. But the bacteria is what lies behind the old advice to only eat oysters in months with an r in the name—that is, not in summer. Vibrio burgeons in warmer water. It collects in shellfish such as oysters when they filter water while feeding and then makes people ill when they eat the shellfish raw. It can also cause grave infections if it gets into a wound or a nick in the skin."
Climate Change May Shrink the World’s Fish,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/climate-change-study-ocean-fish-size,08-21-2017,A new study suggests warming sea temperatures could result in smaller fish sizes.,"Warming temperatures and loss of oxygen in the sea will shrink hundreds of fish species—from tunas and groupers to salmon, thresher sharks, haddock and cod—even more than previously thought, a new study concludes.

Because warmer seas speed up their metabolisms, fish, squid and other water-breathing creatures will need to draw more oxyen from the ocean. At the same time, warming seas are already reducing the availability of oxygen in many parts of the sea.

A pair of University of British Columbia scientists argue that since the bodies of fish grow faster than their gills, these animals eventually will reach a point where they can't get enough oxygen to sustain normal growth.

“The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting,” Biden told world leaders on Earth Day. “The countries that take decisive actions now will be the ones that reap the clean-energy benefits of the boom that’s coming.”

Shortly after Biden’s bold climate announcement, his administration approved ConocoPhillips’ massive new Willow project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), which the oil giant estimates at its peak will pump up to 160,000 barrels of oil a day out of some 250 wells, producing nearly 600 million barrels of oil over the next 30 years.

The recent study supports a similar prediction made by a Nature Communications study published in 2019 that modeled how phytoplankton will change as oceans continue to warm.  The color of deep blue oceans, shallow turquoise waters, and emerald green coasts is quickly changing as the planet warms, according to new research published in the journal Nature.

Climate change’s hidden threat: grief and trauma,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/climate-change-mental-health-anxiety-trauma,03-24-2023,"As natural disasters grow worse and more frequent, fear about what the future holds is increasingly entering the therapy room.","Climate change is drying out rivers, supercharging wildfires, raising seas, and altering the seasons as we know them. These disastrous changes to the environments we depend on for food and shelter are also harming our mental health.

“Anxiety, grief, despair, depression—we’re seeing a lot of that in research. Especially as more people start to [understand] that climate change is a very real phenomenon,” says Derrick Sebree, a psychologist at the Michigan School of Psychology. 

A recently published UN report noted that mental health cases are resulting from extreme weather and rising temperatures. It also warned that these extreme conditions are only going to worsen. In 2017 the American Psychological Association argued that trauma experts and therapists will be almost as essential as cooling centers and raised homes to help people cope with a changing planet.

Here’s what to know about what climate change is doing to our mental health and what can be done to treat it.

PTSD—the aftermath of trauma 

When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, the storm and resulting floods killed nearly 2,000 people and destroyed nearly 300,000 homes. In Katrina’s aftermath, a study of 400 people found a quarter experienced post-traumatic stress disorder for two years following the storm.  Climate change is drying out rivers, supercharging wildfires, raising seas, and altering the seasons as we know them.

"Climate impacts grow, and U.S. must act, says new report",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/climate-change-US-report0,11-23-2018,The 4th National Climate Assessment takes the temperature of climate change across the United States. The message? Adapt.,"This article was created in partnership with the National Geographic Society.

Today, U.S. government agencies released a heavily anticipated new report about how climate change is impacting the United States. The 4th National Climate Assessment (NCA4) lays out a detailed picture of how communities across the country are already feeling the effects of climate change—from intensified risk of wildfires in California, to droughts slowing agricultural production in Iowa and much more.

The report is the second half of a vast effort by scientists, land managers, public health officials, and others to assess the state of the climate across the U.S. The report's first volume, published in 2017, summarized the state-of-the-art knowledge about how climate is affecting temperatures, water resources, sea-level rise, and other natural systems around the country. The second half, published today, focuses on how climate change is already tugging at the economic and social fabric of the United States.

In clear, unwavering terms, the new report states that without ""substantial and sustained reductions"" in greenhouse gas emissions, climate change will hurt people, economies, and resources across the U.S. But the report also highlights how its worst impacts can be avoided, by adapting to our warmer world and by working to lessen future changes in Earth's climate.

Climate study warns of vanishing safety window—here’s why,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/climate-change-model-warns-of-difficult-future,03-12-2019,"Millions of possible scenarios were analyzed, and only a few are acceptable, the scientists said.","A new scientific analysis of millions of possible climate futures found only a narrow window to keeping global warming to levels the international community has deemed safe.

Out of 5.2 million possible climate futures, carbon emissions must reach zero by 2030 in every country in the world if we are to stay at less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100 of warming, the target set by the United Nations to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, from rising seas to deadly heat waves.

And unlike last fall’s “Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C” from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—which held out the possibility of a 2.7 degree Fahrenheit (1.5 degree Celsius) climate future—the new paper published March 11 in the journal Nature Climate Change employed three practical constraints: spending to cut carbon emissions would be no more than three percent of global GDP per year; no use of geoengineering or technologies to remove carbon; and the climate’s response to doubling carbon in the atmosphere would be at the median level or higher. The latter is called climate sensitivity—how much warming happens when carbon is added to the atmosphere.

Climate-resilient coral species offer hope for the world’s reefs,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/climate-resilient-coral-species-offer-hope-for-world-reefs,03-10-2022,A new study found two common reef-builders can cope with 2ºC of global warming.,"Two of the world’s most ubiquitous species of reef-building corals seem surprisingly able to survive and even cope well with climate change, according to a new study—at least so long as global warming is kept below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the target set by the Paris Agreement.

“We found hope,” says Rowan McLachlan, a coral expert at Oregon State University and lead author of the study published today in Nature Scientific Reports. 

Hope has been a scarce thing lately on coral reefs. As a result of human-made greenhouse gas emissions, they face chronically warmer water, more intense marine heat waves, and an increasingly acidic ocean. That’s in addition to local stresses from pollution and overfishing.  Two of the world’s most ubiquitous species of reef-building corals seem surprisingly able to survive and even cope well with climate change, according to a new study—at least so long as global warming is kept below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the target set by the Paris Agreement.

Cobalt powers our lives. What is it—and why is it so controversial?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/cobalt-mining-congo-batteries-electric-vehicles,12-21-2023,The silvery blue metal is used to make lithium-ion batteries that supply energy to everything from cars to e-cigarettes. It’s also toxic and mined in Congo—where thousands of workers toil in “subhuman” conditions.,"Cobalt is essential for powering our modern technology. The metal is commonly used to make lithium-ion batteries, which are found in items such as electric vehicles, computers, smartphones, and even e-cigarettes.  

As many countries pivot towards renewable energy, demand for these batteries has never been higher. Global demand for cobalt is expected to grow fourfold by 2030, according to a white paper report from the World Economic Forum, largely thanks to widespread adoption of electric vehicles. 

Yet the cobalt that helps power them and other technology comes with serious humanitarian concerns where it’s mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  Cobalt is essential for powering our modern technology. The metal is commonly used to make lithium-ion batteries, which are found in items such as electric vehicles, computers, smartphones, and even e-cigarettes.

Reaching a length of up to two feet (0.6 meters) and a weight of five pounds (2.3 kilograms), the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) is the biggest lizard native to the U.S. But it's largely nocturnal and secretive, so sightings are fairly rare. Their black bodies are covered with bold, distinctive patterns of orange, yellow, or even pink—warning signs of their toxic venom. Bites from the lizards can be extremely painful but are rarely fatal to people.

Colossal volcano behind 'mystery' global cooling finally found,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/colossal-volcano-behind-mystery-global-cooling-found,08-23-2019,The eruption devastated local Maya settlements and caused crop failures around the world.,"Editor’s note: On September 28, a follow-up study that analyzed tree rings and a layer of volcanic ash preserved in a distant glacier placed a new date of 431 A.D. on the Ilopango eruption—a century before the period of global cooling. The analysis suggests that while the eruption devastated the local landscape, it likely had little impact on global climate. Our story about an earlier analysis of this volcanic event is below.

The ices of Greenland and Antarctica bear the fingerprints of a monster: a gigantic volcanic eruption in 539 or 540 A.D. that killed tens of thousands and helped trigger one of the worst periods of global cooling in the last 2,000 years. Now, after years of searching, a team of scientists has finally tracked down the source of the eruption.

The team’s work, published in Quaternary Science Reviews, lays out new evidence that ties the natural disaster to Ilopango, a now-dormant volcano in El Salvador. Researchers estimate that in its sixth-century eruption, Ilopango expelled the equivalent of 10.5 cubic miles of dense rock, making it one of the biggest volcanic events on Earth in the last 7,000 years. The blast was more than a hundred times bigger than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption and several times larger than the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. It dealt the local Maya settlements a blow that forever altered their trajectory.

“This is the largest eruption in Central America that human beings have ever witnessed,” says lead study author Robert Dull, a geologist at California Lutheran University. “The importance of the event is even greater, both how the Maya overcame it and how it impacted what happened next.” Editor’s note: On September 28, a follow-up study that analyzed tree rings and a layer of volcanic ash preserved in a distant glacier placed a new date of 431 A.D. on the Ilopango eruption—a century before the period of global cooling.

“Things are unfortunately shaping up to be an active hurricane season in the Atlantic, which is probably not what people are wanting to hear,” says Phil Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University who specializes in Atlantic Ocean hurricanes.

In an average year, around 12 named storms form—with anything from a tropical storm to a full-fledged hurricane earning an official moniker. This year, forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predict that anywhere from 13 to 19 large storms could spin up, with as many as six becoming major hurricanes.

The summer storm wasn’t the first time the city confronted the danger of rising seas and climate-intensified storms. Twelve years ago, Superstorm Sandy flooded Staten Island. But in the wake of the destruction a visionary idea took hold—to use nature as a storm barrier.

David Letterman Tackles Climate Change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/3-questions-david-letterman,09-15-2016,The former late-night host talks about the warming world and seeing abject poverty.,"This story appears in the October 2016 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Watch season two of Years of Living Dangerously, beginning October 30 on the National Geographic Channel.

After his 33-year run as a late-night television host, David Letterman, 69, wanted to try something new. The comedian now brings his curiosity and humor to the second season of Years of Living Dangerously, a National Geographic Channel series on the impacts of—and solutions to—climate change. For the show he traveled to India, population 1.3 billion, to learn about the world’s energy future.

You and climate change—what’s the connection?

Well, for years I thought I didn’t want to influence people on matters of conscience. I’m not that smart. But then a few years ago someone uttered what has become the cliché in regard to climate change, and that is: What will we tell our children when they say, “Why didn’t you do anything about this?” I bought that—hook, line, and sinker. That’s the headline for me to start paying attention and start, in small ways, to do something. People are being displaced. People’s ways of life are changing. The questions of adaptability are enormous.

You went to report in India. What was that like?

Everything surprised me. It was jaw-dropping. I look at 1.3 billion people and say, “Well, that’s the problem”—and they look at it as the solution. It’s a population that’s quite young, and they see that as a huge resource. Honestly I’ve never seen poverty like [I saw there]. I saw people living in thatched huts and mud homes, breathing coal and kerosene fumes. Because I’ve been lucky in my life, I’ve come to this observation—and I’m embarrassed to say this—late in my life. I feel like these people did me a tremendous favor.

Was there any part of the trip you found funny?

First of all, when you talk about me, you have to put “comedy” in air quotes. It’s difficult to be funny when you’re sitting on the floor of a mud hut. But talking to kids on the floor of a mud hut is the same as talking to kids in tiny chairs in a kindergarten. They’re kids, they giggle, they have funny things to say, even through a translator. Regardless of the surroundings and their condition, I felt really comfortable talking to these kids, because there’s nothing more fun than goofing with kids. That’s something universal.

Using 15 years of data from 2001 to 2016, Goldstein and her research team were able to see upticks in PDV that corresponded with declines in Arctic sea ice. This new range for the otters likely allowed infected animals to move west, into new territories where the virus had not appeared before.

These wrinkly white insects—offspring of the Rhynchophorus palmarum beetle—have viscous guts the consistency of melted butter and stringy skin that sticks in your teeth like cooked celery. In the rainforest cities of Peru, locals call this grub suri and consider it a delicacy. 

As an after-dinner snack one evening, I purchased a couple from a street vendor, their plump bodies impaled on a skewer along with two lightly fried chunks of plantain. Severing head from body is a process best avoided on a date night. Upon first bite, I only succeeded in popping the succulent pouch and dribbling oil all over my shirt. Then a chunk of suri wedged itself between two molars so I gave up chewing and just slurped the thing down spaghetti-style. It tasted like melted butter.

The author of Walden recorded first flowering times from 1852 to 1858 for more than 300 plant species in Concord, Massachusetts. During his daily wanderings through field and forest, he also noted when migrating birds returned, when leaves burst forth on trees, and when the ice melted on Walden Pond.

The Lofoten Islands are among the world’s most scenic and formidable destinations for winter surfing. Massive Arctic swells regularly hit the bay of Unstad, a tiny town with an outsize reputation. But surfing is not the archipelago’s only draw; adventurers also explore the hiking trails, fishing culture, and northern lights.

Enveloped by Arctic currents and narrow fjords, the Lofoten archipelago lures thrill seekers—including wintertime surfers. Riding the frigid waves here requires a dose of Norwegian indre kraft, or inner strength. In the past decade, technical advances in cold water attire have made it possible to spend much more time in normally numbing temperatures. “It’s just us, our surfboards, and the vastness of nature,” says German surfer Aline Bock. (This Norwegian concept of outdoor living could help us through the coronavirus winter.)

Island life

After surfing, stand-up paddleboarding, or hiking, adventurers can break their icy isolation by warming up to the centuries-old fishing culture that defines the islands. Among the weathered red rorbu cabins, racks of cod dry in the wind, providing the main ingredient for the local fish stew. Daylight is fleeting above the Arctic Circle in winter, which gives ample opportunity to chase the green swirls of the northern lights, especially around the villages of Reine and Svolvær.

When the perfect wave comes and you catch it really well, it’s pure joy and happiness.

Awarded a “sustainable destination” seal of approval by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, the Lofoten archipelago has focused on preserving its culture and reducing the negative impact of tourism. As climate change causes glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, the islands’ waves may eventually become too treacherous to ride. Successful conservation efforts, such as ending offshore fossil fuel development, could benefit the environment as well as the people. (Winter surfing is hot. Can it survive climate change?)

I was thinking about Brianna Randall’s article for us this week, about cattle ranchers in the Great Plains who are trying to bring fire back to the tall-grass prairie, when I picked up the Sunday Washington Post and read the latest food fight about meat. Nutritious tastiness or planetary menace? Responsible for 23 percent of global greenhouse emissions, as one opinion piece claimed, or merely 14 percent, according to another?

Gentle reader, you decide. Except how can you really?

A few years ago I tried to sort through the tangle, at least for American eaters of beef, of which I am occasionally still one. The reasons for concern about the environmental impact of beef have only increased since.

In the western United States, most of which is in persistent drought and facing a parched future, a third of all consumed water is used to irrigate crops to feed cattle. Air pollution from meat production causes thousands of deaths in the U.S. a year, Sarah Gibbens wrote last week. In Brazil, cattle ranching and soy production for livestock feed are major drivers of Amazon deforestation—just one sign that feeding 9 or 10 billion people an American carnivore’s diet is not going to work. There’s not enough planet for that.

For all those reasons and more—our own health, the welfare of animals—eating less meat is a fine idea.

But I still think that focusing on that as a strategy in the climate fight is a terrible idea, especially in the U.S. First, it’s obviously not working—beef consumption has ticked up over the past few years, in spite of all the talk about it. Second, even it worked, it wouldn’t help climate much: Methane-belching cattle and manure piles and ponds account for just 4 percent of U.S. greenhouse emissions, according to the EPA.

On the other hand, harping on beef is a great way to inflame the culture wars, as Brent Cunningham wrote in the Post, and thus to impede all kinds of progress.

Meanwhile, back in the Great Plains, Randall writes, a bunch of cattle ranchers are doing a good thing for the tall-grass prairie. They’re setting fire to it occasionally, the way Native Americans once did. That’s keeping trees from invading the last remnants of these gorgeous grasslands. “Fire is what keeps the prairie a prairie,” Kansas rancher Bill Sproul told Randall. It also allows him and other ranchers in the Flint Hills to graze more than a million steers on rich grass. (Pictured below, a controlled burn in Oregon.)

The other thing that used to keep trees out of the prairie were bison. There were anywhere from 30 million to 60 million of them before Europeans arrived and killed them. Their total methane emissions were probably close to those of beef cattle today. Would I like to see great belching herds of bison return to the Plains, even though they wouldn’t exactly help with the climate struggle? You bet I would.

Every year, about 15 billion trees are cut down to make way for agriculture, mining, logging, and urban sprawl. Such mass deforestation has accelerated global warming and imperiled the survival of millions of species. Though many nations, organizations, and even individuals have tried, no one has been able to plant enough trees to make up for that loss—but some innovative entrepreneurs are working on a high-tech solution.

BioCarbon Engineering (BCE), a U.K.-based start-up, has developed a technique that they say could potentially plant one billion trees per year. The method? Drones.

Current tree-planting programs ""are just not fast enough,” said Irina Fedorenko, a co-founder of the company. “But our technology is automated, so we can scale up quite realistically and quite quickly.” (Learn about the teenager who is on track to plant a trillion trees.)

Drowning World,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/drowning-world-flooding-photography,02-01-2015,A photographer concerned about climate change depicts flooded-out lives across the globe.,"This story appears in the February 2015 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Extreme weather, sometimes related to climate change, seems to be everywhere these days. And yet it can be hard to see the impact on individual lives. I began documenting that impact in 2007, when I photographed two floods that occurred within weeks of each other, one in the U.K. and the other in India. I was deeply struck by the contrasting effects of these floods and the shared vulnerability that seemed to unite their victims.

Since then I have visited flood zones around the world, traveling to Haiti, Pakistan, Australia, Thailand, Nigeria, Germany, the Philippines, and the U.K. again. In flooded landscapes, life is suddenly turned upside down, and normality is suspended.

Portraits rest at the heart of this project. I often follow my subjects as they return home through deep waters, and work with them to create an intimate image in their flooded homes. Though their poses may be conventional, their environment is disconcertingly altered. Often they’re angry about their circumstances or the inadequate response from the authorities. Many want their plight to be witnessed and want the world to know what has happened to them.

I shoot on film with old Rolleiflex cameras. Digital would be easier, but the texture of film has a particular quality for me, and the process of using an old camera adds formality and gravitas to the situation.

The flood is an ancient metaphor in many cultures, a destructive force that renders humans powerless. As weather becomes more extreme, the biblical is becoming literal. This story appears in the February 2015 issue of National Geographic magazine.

The carbon emissions rate is ten times greater today than during the prehistoric hot period that is the closest precedent for today's greenhouse warming.

Particularly in the last five years, we have been drawing attention not only to the problems—which are both apparent and accelerating in their urgency—but also to the solutions that could help us address the problems that we all face as living creatures on planet Earth.

What follows is a curated list of 20 stories from this period that explore the state of our home, all of enduring relevance today. We have pieces on how the natural world is being reshaped, on global pollution, and on the promise and perils of our rapid energy transition. And we look at the effects of environmental changes on us, from food insecurity to conflict.

There are three key takeaways from this coverage, as I see it. First, as we look to address the root causes of climate change—notably, greenhouse gas emissions—we will need to leverage technology to assist us, alongside overall reductions, and some of that technology is promising. Second, we are not currently doing either of those things fast enough and need greater commitment across the public and private sectors, and from each of us as individuals, to reverse our current trajectory. And third, both now and in the future, the impact of environmental crises will not be felt equally, with the most vulnerable among us—both wildlife and human populations—suffering the most. But the problem belongs to all of us to solve, and we can only do so together. I remain hopeful that we can.

Then, almost in a geologic instant, the air grew warmer and the land dried out. As the water disappeared, so too did the life. And yet, researchers have struggled to pin down a climate-related culprit behind this ecological collapse.

Now, a study published in the journal Geology suggests that it wasn’t the climate that changed, but the geographic location of the landscape. Paleomagnetic signatures in the area’s rocks indicate that sometime between 174 and 157 million years ago, the whole region shifted southward by a startling 25 degrees, plunging once lush landscapes into zones of desiccating heat.

See the wildlife that calls them home.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/extreme-animals-that-live-in-grasslands,04-11-2019,"Agricultural development has endangered grasslands around the world, making life tough for animals on the plains.","Grasslands seem like simple enough habitats. Grassland animals have vast, flat expanses of land on which to roam, feed, sleep and thrive. They don’t need to navigate the extreme altitudes and freezing temperatures of craggy mountains, or deal with ocean perils like plastic debris and warming waters.

But it’s the very traits that make grasslands appealing that put them at risk. Flat and often highly fertile, they’re prone to being seized for agriculture, ranching, and development. They’re also exposed, making them easier landscapes for poachers to find animals. All this human encroachment into grasslands imperils these rich habitats that animals, from cheetahs to caribou to prairie chickens, call home.

Temperate grasslands—those that get cooler in winter—are especially hard-hit. Found on every continent but Antartica, temperate grasslands account for eight percent of the planet’s land. They’re recognized as one of the most endangered ecosystems on Earth, according to the Grasslands Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the global authority on the conservation status of wild animals and wild places.

Easing the impact of climate change on coffee growers,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/partner-content-impact-climate-change-on-coffee-growers,09-04-2020,Nespresso's new crop insurance helps small Colombian coffee growers manage increasingly unpredictable weather.,"The impacts of climate change hit close to home on Colombia's small, independent coffee farms. For the farm families who grow coffee high up on the mist-shrouded slopes of the Andes in the Caldas province, increasingly erratic and extreme weather conditions, such as excess rainfall and more frequent droughts, are threatening a way of life generations in the making. Drought can damage bean development inside ripening fruit, resulting in beans that are twisted, undersized, or otherwise not fully formed. Meanwhile, too much rain during the delicate flowering stage can harm the flowers and keep fruit from developing at all—no flowers means no coffee cherries.

""When there are adverse climatic events it affects the quality and quantity of the coffee,"" says Caldas coffee farmer Edilma Garzón Gutierrez. ""Sometimes we have to look for another kind of income because the coffee will not suffice.""

To help Doña Edilma and other smallholder coffee farmers in Caldas protect their livelihood, Nespresso, in partnership with Blue Marble Microinsurance, launched a pilot weather-index insurance program in 2018 that provides custom coverage for crop losses due to climatic shocks. Farmers have already started to receive a payback from this insurance in 2019. The impacts of climate change hit close to home on Colombia's small, independent coffee farms.

East Antarctic Ice Has a Wild Past.

The ice covering East Antarctica, more than 12,000 feet thick in many places, has long been considered more stable and permanent than the West Antarctic Ice Sheet —and thus more likely to weather global warming unscathed. But the new research, published this week in Nature by Sean Gulick of the University of Texas, Amelia Shevenell of the University of South Florida, and their colleagues, reinforces a growing concern that large swaths of East Antarctica are more vulnerable than once thought.

In recent years scientists have mapped the East Antarctic bedrock with ice-penetrating radar and found that, like West Antarctica, it includes large regions that plunge thousands of feet below sea level. Because they sit on such low ground, those areas of the ice sheet are susceptible to melting by deep, warm ocean currents.

Sooner than you might think, according to researchers at the International Monetary Fund and Georgetown University: Based on how quickly horses and buggies disappeared in the early 1900s, the researchers argue, more than 90 per cent of all passenger vehicles in the U.S., Canada, Europe and other rich countries could be electric by 2040.

Along with a spate of recent commitments to electric vehicles by governments and car companies, the study offers hope about the prospects for weaning the transportation sector off carbon. Of more than one billion registered vehicles on the road today, only two million are electric (with one million of those in China). But if EVs catch on as fast as the researchers project, it could reduce oil use by 21 million barrels a day and cut CO2 emissions 3.2 billion tons a year — equivalent to 60 percent of total U.S. emissions today.

The questions for Obama were sent to the White House on Monday morning and the answers were returned on Wednesday night.  America has “the technological innovation and scientific imagination” to fight climate change and other environmental threats, President Obama says. But he warns that the country is not ready to abandon fossil fuels and must prepare for ecological changes to come.

As the nation celebrated Earth Day, Obama agreed to answer, in written form, ten questions from National Geographic on environmental topics. In his answers, the president insists he will take action if Congress doesn’t tackle public health threats. He also says he is offering federal assistance to California to find solutions to store more water and is trying inventive ways to combat illegal fishing of sharks, turtles, and other ocean life through international trade agreements.

"Exclusive: Obama on Threats to Nature, Power of National Parks",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/president-obama-yosemite-national-parks-climate-conservation,06-19-2016,"During a visit to Yosemite, the president urges Americans to help protect parks for future generations and highlights his efforts on land, water preservation.","Americans should embrace their national parks as symbols of the planet’s beauty and history—and help protect them from the ravages of climate change, President Barack Obama said Saturday during an exclusive interview with National Geographic in Yosemite National Park.

Strolling through a forested stretch of Yosemite’s lush valley, below towering granite cliffs and North America's tallest waterfall, the president spoke wistfully about how parks can inspire young minds, bring families together and be a reminder of the need to respond to climate change. The Hawaii-born president recounted one of his favorite childhood memories—a trip to the mainland with his mother and grandmother when he was 11 that included a trip to Yellowstone National Park—and said he was envious of nature-lover Teddy Roosevelt, who frequently disappeared into the woods during his presidency more than a century ago, and became a leader in protecting America’s wild places.

“One of the things that binds us together is we only have one planet and climate change is probably the biggest threat – not only to natural wonders like this—but to the well-being of billions of people, coastal cities, agricultural communities that can be displaced in the span of a few decades by changes in temperatures that mean more drought, more wildfires,” said Obama, who was one of the driving forces behind a new international agreement that seeks to curb the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.

More than 125 were confirmed dead as of Friday.

While scientists are still piecing together how climate change might have influenced this one weather event, they say it shows key characteristics of how storms will be impacted by climate change: higher amounts of rainfall falling for longer.

The rainfall set new records over the Rhine River Basin in Germany, where most of the flooding occurred. Streets became navigable only by boat, homes were inundated, sinkholes opened up, and part of a castle was swept away.

Explore the soil with a super scooper,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/family/planet-possible-challenges/article/challenge-3-explore-the-soil-with-a-super-scooper,06-17-2021,"Show kids the importance of what’s inside the soil—everything from nutrients that feed plants, homes for healthy bacteria, and carbon to fight climate change. Help them make a super scooper to explore this important microhabitat.","Make It!

What you'll need:
• Permanent marker
• Empty, clean plastic milk container with a handle
• Scissors or crafting knife
• Hole puncher (optional)
• String or ribbon (optional)
• Colored or decorative masking tape

Step 1

Draw a ring around the top of the milk container’s handle.

Step 2

At the end of the handle, draw a horizontal line that extends out to each side of the jug. Then draw two vertical lines down so they join at a center point. 

Step 3

Cut along the ring and the lines.

Step 4

If necessary, trim the digger’s edges for a smooth finish.

Step 5 (optional)

With a hole puncher, create two holes in the sides of the handle that kids can tie string or ribbon through. That way they can hang up their tool or clip it to their backpacks on exploration trips.

Step 6

Cover the handle’s top hole with a circle of tape, then wrap more all the way around the sides of the handle until you have a sturdy grip. If you’ve created holes for string, either leave the holes uncovered, or punch holes big enough for the string to pass through with a crafting knife or large needle.

Try It!

Dig a hole in the dirt a few inches deep, scoop out some soil, and place it on a sheet of white paper. With tweezers, have kids explore the composition of the soil. (Tip: Use the magnifier from Challenge 1 to carefully inspect it.) Use these questions and activities to inspire curiosity and talk about the things that live in this microhabitat:

• What kinds of things can you see in the soil? Pebbles? Twigs? Worms? Insects?
• Why do you think these things are in the soil and not aboveground?
• Take a small clod of dirt and dampen the soil. Then add a little vinegar. If it fizzes, that means the soil isn’t very acidic and will support native plants that prefer this type of soil. Make It!

SE: Well, I got knocked over by a wave when I was a little kid, on the New Jersey shore. I couldn’t breathe—and then suddenly my toes touched the bottom and my head came out, and I realized that was kind of cool. It was fun. Then my family moved to Florida when I was 12, and my backyard was the Gulf of Mexico. You know, kids are naturally explorers. They are scientists from the get-go, always asking questions.

Exploring an epic Colorado river during record-breaking drought,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/exploring-an-epic-colorado-river-during-record-breaking-drought,10-05-2021,"Climate change is sucking water from the West’s beloved rivers, but there are lessons to be found in the change.","On the third day of a six-day trip down the Yampa River, we started walking. A slurry of flash rainstorms had rattled our tents the night before and raised our hopes the river would rise. It didn’t. When our bottoms ground to a halt on the riverbed, we grudgingly rolled up our boats–inflatable one-person kayak-shaped pack rafts—shouldered our 60-pound backpacks and started lumbering down the naked channel. If we were going to reach the end of the river before our own food ran out, we had to keep moving.

 “Walking has to be faster,” said my companion Len Necefer, a former professor of engineering at Northern Arizona University.

With only a few small dams and diversions, the 250-mile-long Yampa is one of just a few free-flowing rivers in the United States and the longest in Colorado. Beloved by rafters for its wild whitewater in spring, it’s a lifeline for ranchers and residents in northern Colorado. But it’s also the main tributary to the Green River and a major supplier to the Colorado River system, which supplies water to 40 million people and irrigates five and half million acres of farmland in seven states.

Extreme Research Shows How Arctic Ice Is Dwindling,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/arctic-ice-environment,12-14-2015,What happens when the planet loses some of its ability to cool itself?,"This story appears in the January 2016 issue of National Geographic magazine.

The sea ice that blankets the Arctic Ocean isn’t the unbroken white mantle depicted in maps. It’s a jigsaw puzzle of restless floes that are constantly colliding, deforming, and fracturing from the force of wind and ocean currents. Last February I stood shivering on the deck of the Lance, an old Norwegian research vessel, as it picked a path through a labyrinth of navigable fractures. A barren white plain of ice and snow extended to the horizon in every direction. The ship’s steel hull shuddered and screeched as it plowed through floating chunks of jagged ice. The Lance was seeking a solid patch of ice to attach to—the last one had shattered—so that it could resume its erratic drift across the frozen sea, charting the fate of Arctic sea ice by going with the floe.

The Norwegians have done this before, more than a century ago, when polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen and the Fram were locked in pack ice for nearly three years during a vain attempt to drift across the North Pole. But the Arctic is a different ocean now. The air above it has warmed on average about 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past century, more than twice the global average. Much less of the ocean is covered by ice, and much more of that ice is thinner, seasonal ice rather than thick, old floes. A feedback loop with far-reaching consequences has taken effect: As white ice is replaced in summer by dark ocean water, which absorbs more sunlight, the water and air heat further—amplifying the ongoing thaw.

“The Arctic warms first, most, and fastest,” explains Kim Holmén, the long-bearded international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI), which operates theLance. Climate models predict that by as early as 2040 it will be possible in summer to sail across open water to the North Pole.

Arctic sea ice helps cool the whole planet by reflecting sunlight back into space. So its loss inevitably will affect the climate and weather beyond the Arctic, but precisely how remains unclear. Better forecasts require better data on sea ice and its shifting, uneven distribution. “Most scientific cruises to the Arctic are conducted in summer, and this is where we have the most field data,” says Gunnar Spreen, an NPI sea-ice physicist I met on board the Lance. “The continuous changes that occur from winter into spring are a huge gap in our understanding.” This story appears in the January 2016 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Extreme Weather: 13 Striking Pictures,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/150411-pictures-weather-storm-climate-change-hurricane-tornado-lightning,04-11-2015,Scientists predict that climate change will intensify the severity of storms.,"A batch of twisters ripped through Illinois this week, flattening homes and causing injuries and at least two confirmed deaths. The storm-caused havoc is a reminder that spring is tornado season in the United States. These photos show hurricanes, rainstorms, and other types of extreme weather around the world. Scientists predict that these storms will change as global temperatures rise, but not in the way you might think.

Many scientists don’t expect the total number of storms to increase (some think it might decrease); rather, they expect hurricanes and rainstorms to become more severe.

According to Michael Wehner, senior staff scientist in the Computational Research Division at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, these changes will likely become noticeable with a rise of 2°C in the average global surface temperature.

Extreme drought creates unlikely farming allies in the Arizona desert,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/extreme-drought-creates-unlikely-farming-allies-in-the-arizona-desert,01-28-2022,"As control of the river water that allows desert farming shifts, a deep love of agriculture unites groups that have historically been at odds.","Jace Miller has always known exactly what he wanted to do. He began working on his family’s farm south of Phoenix at the age of nine. When other boys were playing football, he was driving a tractor. He has grown to love the long, hot days and even the acts of God. At 30, he’s inheriting a century-old farming business, has a first child on the way, and says there are only two things that could force a career change: “For me, it’s bankruptcy or death. I’m a farmer.”That commitment was put to the test last summer, when Miller found out he was going to lose the Colorado River water that sustains the thirsty alfalfa and hay he grows in Pinal County. That makes him like hundreds of other farmers in central Arizona—but Miller has found a way, for now, to keep farming: He’s doing it on land belonging to the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC), which now holds rights to a sizeable portion of the river’s flow.

    The broad and dusty basin between Phoenix and Tucson has emerged as an epicenter of the water crisis in the Colorado River Basin. Despite being more than 300 miles from the river, farmers here have since the 1980s depended almost exclusively on river water delivered by a canal. Today, years of extreme drought have slowed the once mighty river to a trickle. Water levels in Lakes Mead and Powell–massive reservoirs that feed the entire region–have fallen to record lows. Jace Miller has always known exactly what he wanted to do. He began working on his family’s farm south of Phoenix at the age of nine. When other boys were playing football, he was driving a tractor. He has grown to love the long, hot days and even the acts of God. At 30, he’s inheriting a century-old farming business, has a first child on the way, and says there are only two things that could force a career change: “For me, it’s bankruptcy or death. I’m a farmer.”That commitment was put to the test last summer, when Miller found out he was going to lose the Colorado River water that sustains the thirsty alfalfa and hay he grows in Pinal County. That makes him like hundreds of other farmers in central Arizona—but Miller has found a way, for now, to keep farming: He’s doing it on land belonging to the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC), which now holds rights to a sizeable portion of the river’s flow.

    The broad and dusty basin between Phoenix and Tucson has emerged as an epicenter of the water crisis in the Colorado River Basin. Despite being more than 300 miles from the river, farmers here have since the 1980s depended almost exclusively on river water delivered by a canal. Today, years of extreme drought have slowed the once mighty river to a trickle. Water levels in Lakes Mead and Powell–massive reservoirs that feed the entire region–have fallen to record lows."
Extreme drought threatens Italy’s rice crops—and its beloved risotto,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/extreme-drought-threatens-italy-rice-crops-and-its-beloved-risotto,07-21-2022,"Prized rice varieties used for risotto are grown in northern Italy’s normally flooded paddies, but record heat and drought are causing devastation and consternation.","NOVARA, ITALY — Massimo Saronni walks across his rice field, each step a loud crunch. This field should be flooded with water, flourishing with four-foot emerald green blades and golden rice panicles. Instead, the plants have taken on a yellow-brown tinge and the soil has hardened from lack of rain. Small patches of survivors dot the field, but they only reach his ankle.

“These crops are seriously damaged. They haven’t had water, so they’re not going to make it,” says Saronni, who has worked as a rice farmer for over 30 years. He cultivates different rice varieties, including carnaroli, a high-starch rice prized in Italian cuisine for the creamy risotto it makes.

Northern Italy is suffering from spiking temperatures and its worst drought in more than 70 years. Broad stretches of the Po, Italy’s longest river, have turned to sandy beaches. Its famed lakes, including Maggiore and Como, are also receding. Many canals that branch out of freshwater sources and feed agricultural fields like Saronni’s are now stagnant and drying up.

Unable to fly, the young raptors dealt with the heat in the only way they could: One by one, they threw themselves out. 

Nearly 50 baby Cooper’s and Swainson’s hawks were rescued from the ground beneath towering pines in Washington and Oregon and brought to Blue Mountain Wildlife, a rehabilitation organization in Pendleton, Oregon, which specializes in treating birds of prey. More still were brought to Portland Audubon and other rehabilitation facilities throughout the Pacific Northwest.

The historic heat wave coincided with nesting season, says Lynn Tompkins, director of Blue Mountain Wildlife. If the young birds had been able to fly, they could have sought reprieve in a cooler spot. If they’d had feathers, they’d have been able to regulate their body temperatures. “But these guys were just downy babies,” she says, “and there was nothing to do but bail out.”  As the Pacific Northwest baked in 115 degree heat last month, fuzzy baby hawks sat sweltering in their nests, 50 feet off the ground.

Fast-Growing Moss Is Turning Antarctica Green,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/antarctica-green-climate-moss-environment,05-20-2017,Rising temperatures have boosted the growth rates of seasonal moss on the southern continent over the last 50 years.,"The icy landscape of Antarctica is getting decidedly greener.

By drilling down into layers of moss that have accumulated on the southern continent over the last 150 years, researchers discovered that those diminutive plants have done more growing than usual in the last five decades.

The driving force, they say, is warmer global temperatures—as Antarctica’s ice melts, more water is available to moisten the mosses, and the rising heat provides longer growing seasons for the plants. (Also see “Antarctica Is Covered With More Meltwater Than Thought.”) The icy landscape of Antarctica is getting decidedly greener.

I’ll never forget seeing an enormous walrus face down a young polar bear (which wisely decided to move along).

I also won’t forget the ship’s captain, Leif Skog, announcing that we had traveled farther north than this expedition ever had before. We knew that was saying something—Skog had been navigating polar waters for four decades. How amazing, we initially thought.

And then, of course, the experience turned sobering as we realized why we’d gotten so far: because sea ice that normally halts the ship’s northward progress had melted.

"Fight Climate Change by Suing Polluters, Says Scientist",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/james-hansen-fight-climate-change-sue-pollutors-cop23,11-07-2017,Prominent climate scientist James Hansen has a message for world leaders gathering in Germany for the United Nations conference on global warming.,"Countries should sue the world’s biggest oil, coal and gas, and cement companies for damages resulting from climate change—says well-known climate scientist James Hansen.

Hansen, a former NASA scientist who warned Congress about the dangers of climate change in 1988, says global warming of 2°C, or even 1.5°C, is dangerous, risking sea level rise of at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years. That would put major parts of coastal cities like New York underwater. He believes major impacts of climate change are happening faster than what is reported in even the latest science reports, including the U.S. government’s Climate Science Special Report released last Friday.

An enormous amount of money is urgently needed to dramatically slash emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), take existing CO2 out of the atmosphere, and for countries to cope with the impacts of climate change, Hansen argues. And that money should come from the companies that profited most from burning fossil fuels, Hansen will tell world leaders Tuesday in Bonn, Germany, at the annual United Nations climate negotiations.

A small rodent that lived only on a single island off Australia is likely the world's first mammal to become a casualty of climate change, scientists reported in June 2016. The government of Australia has now officially recognized the Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola) as extinct.


The animal seems to have disappeared from its home in the eastern Torres Strait of the Great Barrier Reef, scientists say. The animal was last seen by a fisherman in 2009, but failed attempts to trap any in late 2014 prompted scientists to say it is likely extinct.

First study of all Amazon greenhouse gases suggests the damaged forest is now worsening climate change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/amazon-rainforest-now-appears-to-be-contributing-to-climate-change,03-11-2021,The first broad look at all of the gases that affect how the Amazon works—not just CO2—reveals a system on the brink.,"The Amazon rainforest is most likely now a net contributor to warming of the planet, according to a first-of-its-kind analysis from more than 30 scientists.

For years, researchers have expressed concern that rising temperatures, drought, and deforestation are reducing the capacity of the world’s largest rainforest to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and help offset emissions from fossil-fuel burning. Recent studies have even suggested that some portions of the tropical landscape already may release more carbon than they store.

But the inhaling and exhaling of CO2 is just one way this damp jungle, the most species-rich on Earth, influences the global climate. Activities in the Amazon, both natural and human-caused, can shift the rainforest’s contribution in significant ways, warming the air directly or releasing other greenhouse gases that do.

Now, scientists may have uncovered clues about what happened in the ""Great Dying,"" or Permian extinction.","Antarctica is one of the harshest environments on the planet. As the coldest, driest continent, it harbors a world of extremes. The powerful katabatic winds that rush from the polar plateau down the steep, vertical drops around the continent's coast can stir up turbulent snowstorms lasting days or weeks, and the endlessly barren terrain gives Antarctica the title of the world's largest desert.

Today, polar summers pound the continent with 24 unforgiving hours of light for about half the year, before polar winters plunge it into complete darkness for the other half. Regardless of the season, the temperatures are consistently below freezing, making treks to the landmass unthinkable for the faint of heart.

But Antarctica wasn't always like this. Hundreds of millions of years ago, the continent was smushed together with other modern-day landmasses to form the supercontinent Gondwana. Gondwana was humid and carpeted with a network of hardy plants. As the turbulent climate shifted from hot to cold on a sometimes monthly basis, the streamlined foliage would have needed to withstand extremes.

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet

Since the 1970s warming ocean waters have melted a significant section of ice in the Amundsen Sea in the Southern Ocean – so much that collapse of a far greater mass of ice may be inevitable. Scientists from NASA and elsewhere, based on a half-dozen studies in the past two years, now believe it may be too late to stop  so much Antarctic ice from melting that it would send sea levels rising 16 feet more, inundating regions home to hundreds of millions of people. What may still be possible, however, is for humans to control just when that might happen.

Scientists from NASA and elsewhere, based on a half-dozen studies in the past two years, now believe it may be too late to stop  so much Antarctic ice from melting that it would send sea levels rising 16 feet more, inundating regions home to hundreds of millions of people. What may still be possible, however, is for humans to control just when that might happen."

Normal, simple houses designed to be at ground level take on a whole different look up in the air.

After Superstorm Sandy slammed into the New Jersey shore in 2012, people whose houses were still standing began having them raised—lifted on temporary pilings so that permanent foundations could be put in. Some did it to meet new construction codes or to reduce their flood insurance rates. But for others, I think, it was just a heartfelt bid to stay where they had sunk their roots, no matter the surroundings.

The Himalaya, the breathtaking consequence of the battle between two tectonic plates, is home to spectacular mountains and a family of glaciers whose waters sustain 1.65 billion people across the region. The thawing of these glaciers leaves behind a myriad of lakes, some of which can suddenly burst their banks and flood downstream.

Plenty of these lakes can also be found in the Tibetan Plateau, an elevated region containing Tibet and parts of western China, and a team of researchers wanted to know if any of them posed a threat to those that live nearby. Their satellite-based assessment of 1,291 glacial lakes in the Tibetan Plateau and along the main Himalaya range found that 16 percent of them potentially threaten human settlements.

All these lakes form naturally, and localized topographical, geological, and hydrological conditions determine which lakes can or will eventually overflow.

"Floods, explained",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/floods,04-04-2019,Floods are among Earth's most common–and most destructive–natural hazards.,"There are few places on Earth where flooding is not a concern. Any area where rain falls is vulnerable to floods, though rain is not the only cause.

How floods form

A flood occurs when water inundates land that's normally dry, which can happen in a multitude of ways.

Excessive rain, a ruptured dam or levee, rapid melting of snow or ice, or even an unfortunately placed beaver dam can overwhelm a river, spreading over the adjacent land, called a floodplain. Coastal flooding occurs when a large storm or tsunami causes the sea to surge inland. There are few places on Earth where flooding is not a concern.

"For Antarctica’s emperor penguins, ‘there is no time left’",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/time-running-out-antarcticas-emperor-penguins-breeding-failure,08-24-2023,"A new study predicts a bleak future for these iconic birds, which experienced an unprecedented breeding failure last year due to record-low sea ice levels.","For emperor penguins, sea ice is essential to survival. The iconic birds, found only in Antarctica, breed, lay their eggs, and raise their chicks on fast sea ice (meaning it is attached to land). They arrive at their breeding sites in late March. In May and June, they lay their eggs, which hatch after 65 days during the brutal Antarctic winter. The chicks then remain on the ice until their fluffy down is replaced by waterproof feathers, finally fledging in the summer months of December and January.

Last year, sea ice levels in Antarctica were at an all-time low—a record first set in 2021. The Bellingshausen Sea region, to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, saw the most extreme reduction of sea ice, with some areas experiencing a 100-percent loss.

Of the five known emperor penguin colonies in the Bellingshausen Sea region, all but one experienced what was most likely a total breeding failure due to the loss of sea ice, according to a paper published today in Nature Communications Earth & Environment. Satellite imagery clearly showed the sea ice had broken up before the chicks would have developed enough to survive on their own.

“We have never seen emperor penguins fail to breed at this scale in a single season,” the study’s lead author, Peter Fretwell of the British Antarctic Survey, said in a statement. “The loss of sea ice in this region during the Antarctic summer made it very unlikely that displaced chicks would survive.”

Since 2009, when satellite imagery monitoring began, there have been isolated cases of “catastrophic” breeding failure due to fast ice loss across Antarctica—but this is the first recorded incident of widespread regional breeding failures.

California is currently battling more than two dozen major fires in a season that has already burned more than 2.5 million acres of land—a record figure—and the fire season runs for another four months. Warming temperatures due to climate change have led to longer and more devastating fire seasons in California.

In Northern California, strong, gusty winds intensified the flames of the Bear Fire, which ignited in August amid lightning-induced wildfires that forced evacuations across the region. Those winds blew smoke and ash as far as 150 miles south into the San Francisco Bay Area—lowering air quality to hazardous levels. Wildfire smoke contains a mix of gases and particles from burning vegetation, buildings, and other materials that can cause a number of health problems. It is especially dangerous during the pandemic, since wildfire smoke makes the lungs more susceptible to respiratory infections like COVID-19.

As seen in these photos, massive plumes of smoke cloaked the region in a surreal dark orange glow throughout the day. According to the Bay Area Air District, the phenomenon occurs when smoke particles in the air act as filters that scatter out the colors that form the spectrum of visible light.

Environmentalists are hoping the answer is yes.

A group of Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) and community leaders are gathering in San Francisco on September 12 to discuss solutions they hope will mitigate the impacts of climate change.

They're hoping to reach a solution they're calling 30x30. It's a target set specifically to reach goals set forth by the Paris Climate Agreement to reduce carbon emissions, and the organizations attending the summit think sustainably managed forests and land can meet 30 percent of the targeted emissions reduction.

What can forests do to reduce carbon emissions?

Large forests are capable of sucking up large amounts of carbon. Swaths of forest like those found in the Amazon, the largest forested region on the planet, act like a sink to remove emissions from the atmosphere.

Global Forest Watch, which monitors deforestation in real time, estimates that between 2001 and 2017, 800 million acres of tree cover was lost. Much of that was driven by agriculture, logging, and cattle ranching.

The San Francisco summit will focus on solutions that allow these industries to grow but under regulations that enforce sustainability.

Frances Seymour from the World Resources Institute says countries have the capacity to enforce sustainable forest management, but it's political will that stands between their goals and reality.

After Brazil's Example, Peru Strives to Catch Up

“Brazil is a great example,” Seymour says of a country that has balanced industrial growth and sustainability.

From 2004 to 2012, the country, which contains the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest, reduced deforestation by 80 percent. Can protecting forests help save the planet? Environmentalists are hoping the answer is yes.

Susan Goldberg: Should I call you Paul or Sir Paul or … ?

Paul McCartney: Paul.

SG: OK. I wasn’t sure. I’m American, so I don’t know about these things.

"Fossil fuels, explained",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/fossil-fuels,04-02-2019,"Much of the world's energy comes from material formed hundreds of millions of years ago, and there are environmental consequences for it.","Decomposing plants and other organisms, buried beneath layers of sediment and rock, have taken millennia to become the carbon-rich deposits we now call fossil fuels. These non-renewable fuels, which include coal, oil, and natural gas, supply about 80 percent of the world’s energy. They provide electricity, heat, and transportation, while also feeding the processes that make a huge range of products, from steel to plastics.

When fossil fuels are burned, they release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which in turn trap heat in our atmosphere, making them the primary contributors to global warming and climate change.

Fracking boom tied to methane spike in Earth’s atmosphere,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/fracking-boom-tied-to-methane-spike-in-earths-atmosphere,08-15-2019,"The chemical signature of methane released from fracking is found in the atmosphere, pointing to shale gas operations as the culprit.","Scientists have measured big increases in the amount of methane, the powerful global warming gas, entering the atmosphere over the last decade. Cows or wetlands have been fingered as possible sources, but new research points to methane emissions from fossil fuel production—mainly from shale gas operations in the United States and Canada—as the culprit.

The “massive” increase in methane emissions occurred at the same time as the use of fracking for shale gas took off in the U.S., says Robert Howarth, an ecologist at Cornell University and author of the study published Aug 14 in the journal Biogeosciences.

“We know the increase is largely due to fossil fuel production and this research suggests over half is from shale gas operations,” Howarth says in an interview.

This year could be the turning point. Laurence Tubiana thinks so. She’s a small, elegant, white-haired woman of 63. At a press briefing in a noisy restaurant near Washington’s Capitol Hill, she apologized for being incapable of raising her voice—which in a diplomat is no doubt an excellent quality. Tubiana is no ordinary diplomat: She’s France’s “climate ambassador,” charged with the greatest cat-herding project in history. For the past year and a half she has been traveling the world, meeting with negotiators from 195 countries, trying to ensure that the global climate confab in Paris this December will be a success—a watershed in the struggle against climate change. “This notion of a turning point—that’s super important,” Tubiana says.

There are at least 20 reasons to fear she will fail. Since 1992, when the world’s nations agreed at Rio de Janeiro to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,” they’ve met 20 times without moving the needle on carbon emissions. In that interval we’ve added almost as much carbon to the atmosphere as we did in the previous century. Last year and the past decade were the warmest since temperature records began. Record-breaking heat waves are now five times as likely as they once were. A large part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, scientists reported last year, is doomed to collapse—meaning that in the coming centuries sea level will rise at least four feet and probably much more. We’re already redrawing the map of the planet, especially of the zones where animals, plants, and people can live. This story appears in the November 2015 issue of National Geographic magazine.

But aquaculture hasn't always been the cleanest industry around. The Blue Economy Challenge, sponsored by Australian Aid, the World Wildlife Fund, and several others, aims to nurture new ideas in sustainable aquaculture development that help those already working in the industry improve their lives and make better products.

While seaweed may not sound sexy, global demand for it in food, cosmetics, medicine, and toothpaste has helped female seaweed farmers in Zanzibar earn a decent living for their families for decades.

Now that harvest is being threatened by warming waters, degrading the quality of the seaweed and threatening the livelihood of 10,000 or more of these farmers.

Future Warming Could Worsen Europe's Refugee Crisis,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/climate-change-migrants-refugees-european-union-environment,12-21-2017,A new study lays bare how climate change may shape our interconnected world.,"In recent years, a refugee crisis has gripped the European Union, as unrest in Syria and elsewhere has sent hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe’s shores, seeking safe harbor.

Now, a new study says that if all else were to remain equal—a necessary but major if—the stresses of climate change could drive more migrants into the European Union in future years.

As warming worsens, these influxes would accelerate. Under one scenario where warming stabilizes by 2100, asylum applications could increase by some 28 percent. But in a scenario with “business-as-usual” warming, applications could nearly triple, to more than a million asylum seekers per year.

Game of Thrones Star Sounds the Alarm on Climate Change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/nikolaj-coster-waldau-jamie-lannister-climate-change-united-nations,11-06-2017,Actor and UNDP Goodwill Ambassador Nikolaj Coster-Waldau reports from the frontlines of global warming in Greenland and the Maldives.,"The tricky thing about climate change, and explaining what it is, is that it's very hard to see. It's hard to feel the rising temperatures when the difference is one- or two-tenths of a degree a year. But those tenths of degrees add up. And this year, I visited two remote and very different parts of the world where the effects of climate change are easily visible to the naked eye and eerily similar.

At first glance, one might not think that the massive, imposing ice caps of Greenland have anything in common with the miles of powdery beaches of the Maldives. I certainly didn’t. But when I traveled to the Maldives last month as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme, I was surprised by how familiar the challenges facing the island nation and its people sounded to me. Over and over again, I was reminded of my wife’s native Greenland, where I filmed a climate change project with Google Maps earlier this year.

Made up of numerous islands, both Maldives and Greenland have a widely dispersed population and face infrastructural challenges for services as basic as waste disposal. The residents living in villages scattered across the islands depend largely on fishing for income and sustenance.

Gas heat and stoves are warming the climate. Should cities start banning them?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/gas-heat-and-stoves-are-warming-the-climate-should-cities-start-banning-them,04-02-2021,Buildings are responsible for a lot of carbon emissions. Weaning them off fossil fuels is a key part of the climate solution.,"In the summer of 2019, the city council in Berkeley, California, made a bold and unprecedented move: They banned natural gas hookups in most new building construction.

Councilwoman Kate Harrison, who sponsored the new ordinance, had been on a hunt for ways to reduce the city’s carbon emissions. “We looked at where our emissions were coming from and found that natural gas in buildings played a significant role,” she says—they accounted for a whopping 37 percent of the city’s total. Cars are another big source, but the city has no authority to regulate tailpipe emissions. But buildings? “This is an area we can tackle,” Harrison says.

Berkeley’s pioneering ordinance spurred a wave of similar efforts. Since 2019, more than 40 cities in California have passed similar measures. Proposals to ban gas hookups are now under consideration in Colorado, Washington State, and Massachusetts.

Inspired by the powerful, almost biblical, symbolism of the flood, Mendel’s signature style is to make still and video portraits of people in their submerged environments. The victims often appear stoic, paralyzed, and numb. Yet, Mendel says, they often tell him they are grateful to have him bear witness.

“I sense an almost shared vulnerability across cultures, across nations, across all these different countries,” he says. “When I look at people’s faces through the ground glass of the Rolleiflex, there’s always something quite vulnerable and fragile there.” Since 2007 Gideon Mendel has been strapping on waders, flagging down boats, and taking his Rolleiflex film camera into floodwaters around the world.

Global Warming Is Real—But 13 Degrees? Not So Fast,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/global-warming-study-13-degrees-is-wrong-climate-change,09-26-2016,Scientists are dismissing a new study suggesting Earth could already be doomed to warming of as much as 13 degrees Fahrenheit.,"New research suggesting that the planet might already be committed to vastly greater warming than previously thought is being dismissed as deeply flawed by prominent climate scientists.

A study published today in one of the world's top science journals, Nature, offers the most complete reconstruction to date of global sea-surface temperatures for the past two million years—a valuable addition to the climate record, scientists say.

But the conclusions the study's author drew from that research—that even preventing any further increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could still leave the Earth doomed to a catastrophic temperature rise of up to 7 degrees Celsius (about 13 degrees Fahrenheit)—isn't supported by the data, several top scientists said.

Maple syrup’s use as a food was first recorded in the early 1600s, when French writer Marc Lescarbot noted that Native American tribes “get juice from the trees and distill it down into a very sweet and agreeable liquid.”  The syrup lore goes like this: A chief threw a tomahawk at a tree and noticed the rich syrup dripping from it.  His wife cooked that evening’s venison in the sweet syrup, and the rest is history.

It did—and there’s been a huge surge in human well-being.","This story is part of the optimistic argument for the future of the planet in our special issue on Earth Day. Read the pessimistic argument and the rest of our stories here.Let me date myself right away by saying that I attended a demonstration on the first Earth Day, in 1970. The mood, as I recall it, was both joyous and solemn. Joyous because we were collectively celebrating, for the first time in U.S. history, the natural world around us. Solemn because the voices from the podium were issuing dire prophecies about the fate awaiting that natural world.Such warnings were heard everywhere then. The Nobel Prize–winning biochemist George Wald explained to an audience at the University of Rhode Island that unless immediate action was taken, civilization would end within 15 or 30 years. According to Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, that kind of prediction was overly hopeful. In an interview published for Earth Day, Ehrlich proposed that the planet had only two years left to change course before all “further efforts [to save it] will be futile.” Too optimistic still, believed Earth Day national coordinator Denis Hayes. In an Earth Day–timed article for the Wilderness Society magazine, Hayes argued that it was “already too late to avoid mass starvation.”

It’s easy to understand why they believed this: The global situation was calamitous. At the time of the first Earth Day, about one out of every four people in the world was hungry—“undernourished,” to use the term preferred by the United Nations. About half the world was living in extreme poverty. The average life expectancy in Africa was a mere 45.6 years. Roughly half of Latin America and the Caribbean lacked electricity and access to education. Famines in West Africa had just killed about a million people. Wars, revolts, and insurgencies were raging in Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines), Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, the Portuguese colonies), the Middle East (Oman, Yemen, Jordan), and Latin America (Nicaragua, Colombia, Mexico). A flu pandemic that began in Asia was exploding through much of the rest of the world; it would kill a million people before it was over.The world turned out quite differently from the dire forecasts of 1970, which foresaw a ruinous decline for humankind after the planet had been stripped of its resources.Environmental trends were, if anything, worse. Harbors from London to Los Angeles, Boston to Bombay (now Mumbai), were choked with waste. Most of the planet’s great rivers—the Danube, the Tiber, the Mississippi—were undrinkable. Leaded gasoline released poisonous fumes into the air in such vast quantities that the average U.S. preschooler had four times more lead in his or her blood than what would now require urgent action. So much smog enveloped cities that Life magazine predicted early in 1970 that “by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching Earth by one-half.”

By the first Earth Day, a recently founded international organization, the Club of Rome, was already working on what would become a stunningly influential book: The Limits to Growth, published in 1972. The Limits team created a computer model of the world, then used it to project future demand for resources such as coal, iron, natural gas, and aluminum. In graph after graph, the book depicts a race to a peak of production, followed by a ruinous decline as the planet is stripped bare. To avoid ruin, the team emphasized, humankind’s lurching course forward “must stop soon.” This story is part of the optimistic argument for the future of the planet in our special issue on Earth Day. Read the pessimistic argument and the rest of our stories here.Let me date myself right away by saying that I attended a demonstration on the first Earth Day, in 1970. The mood, as I recall it, was both joyous and solemn. Joyous because we were collectively celebrating, for the first time in U.S. history, the natural world around us. Solemn because the voices from the podium were issuing dire prophecies about the fate awaiting that natural world.Such warnings were heard everywhere then. The Nobel Prize–winning biochemist George Wald explained to an audience at the University of Rhode Island that unless immediate action was taken, civilization would end within 15 or 30 years. According to Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, that kind of prediction was overly hopeful. In an interview published for Earth Day, Ehrlich proposed that the planet had only two years left to change course before all “further efforts [to save it] will be futile.” Too optimistic still, believed Earth Day national coordinator Denis Hayes. In an Earth Day–timed article for the Wilderness Society magazine, Hayes argued that it was “already too late to avoid mass starvation.”

It’s easy to understand why they believed this: The global situation was calamitous. At the time of the first Earth Day, about one out of every four people in the world was hungry—“undernourished,” to use the term preferred by the United Nations. About half the world was living in extreme poverty. The average life expectancy in Africa was a mere 45.6 years. Roughly half of Latin America and the Caribbean lacked electricity and access to education. Famines in West Africa had just killed about a million people. Wars, revolts, and insurgencies were raging in Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines), Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, the Portuguese colonies), the Middle East (Oman, Yemen, Jordan), and Latin America (Nicaragua, Colombia, Mexico). A flu pandemic that began in Asia was exploding through much of the rest of the world; it would kill a million people before it was over.The world turned out quite differently from the dire forecasts of 1970, which foresaw a ruinous decline for humankind after the planet had been stripped of its resources.Environmental trends were, if anything, worse. Harbors from London to Los Angeles, Boston to Bombay (now Mumbai), were choked with waste. Most of the planet’s great rivers—the Danube, the Tiber, the Mississippi—were undrinkable. Leaded gasoline released poisonous fumes into the air in such vast quantities that the average U.S. preschooler had four times more lead in his or her blood than what would now require urgent action. So much smog enveloped cities that Life magazine predicted early in 1970 that “by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching Earth by one-half.”

By the first Earth Day, a recently founded international organization, the Club of Rome, was already working on what would become a stunningly influential book: The Limits to Growth, published in 1972. The Limits team created a computer model of the world, then used it to project future demand for resources such as coal, iron, natural gas, and aluminum. In graph after graph, the book depicts a race to a peak of production, followed by a ruinous decline as the planet is stripped bare. To avoid ruin, the team emphasized, humankind’s lurching course forward “must stop soon.”"

Mr. Trash Wheel and Professor Trash Wheel, the latter of which was installed in December, are solar- and hydro-powered trash interceptors based in Baltimore's Inner Harbor, clearing debris before it enters the Chesapeake Bay. Over a million pounds of trash has been pulled out of the water by Mr. Trash Wheel since it was installed in May 2014.

The trash wheel’s creator, John Kellett, worked on the harbor for years and saw garbage floating on the water every day. A sailor and engineer, he approached the city and offered to take a stab at cleaning up the harbor. He built a pilot trash wheel and installed it in 2008. Join us in The People v.

Wafts of thick black smoke darkened the sky to the south and west of the Greek hilltop where my partner and I had rented a vacation house. Within a few hours, an acrid plume rolled over this previously idyllic stretch of the Peloponnesian mountains. Fire patrols began to tear up and down the adjacent mountainside. By 1 a.m., with seemingly the whole village awake and anxiously scanning the peaks for flames, the stench was so potent that we struggled to breathe. Bundling luggage into the car, we tore down the valley and made the long trip through the night home to Athens.

Even in the Greek capital there is no escaping the crisis that’s come to consume much of the country. A series of overlapping fires on and around Mt.

The government has had to implement rolling blackouts in many neighborhoods after flames consumed vital swathes of electricity infrastructure.

The study, published today in the journal Nature, offers the latest evidence that Earth’s northernmost ice sheet, which contains enough frozen water to raise global sea levels by 24 feet, has entered a period of rapid decline and may melt away entirely if humanity continues burning fossil fuels at current levels. The research also puts to rest the notion that Greenland’s recent deterioration might be part of a natural cycle, by showing just how fast the current meltdown is compared with the ups and downs of the geologic past.

“We have confidence now that this century is going to be unique in the context of natural variability of the last 12,000 years,” says lead study author Jason Briner, a glaciologist at the University at Buffalo.

A research team was almost stranded on the far side of the bridge by the roaring water, and when they returned they warned Rutgers professor Åsa Rennermalm and her team, who were just about to head out to set up their field camp at the end of the road. Rennermalm opted to wait until the next morning when the temperature—and glacially fed river—would be lower to venture out to her research site.

Rennermalm’s team was delayed on July 15, just two days before one of the Greenland Ice Sheet’s three 2018 meltwater peaks, which occurred on July 17, July 31, and August 9. Summer is Greenland’s “melt season,” and these three “significant melt events” encompassed around 193,000 square miles—around one-third of the Greenland Ice Sheet’s surface—according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. These melting events weren’t as severe as 2012’s extreme season, which led to a surface melt of over 97 percent of the ice sheet and washed out a major bridge along the same road, but researchers are concerned and many are investigating the ice sheet to see just how fast it’s disappearing.

But perhaps the biggest surprise is that most of this ice loss is from the land-fast ice sheet itself, not Greenland’s glaciers.

The new study, published January 21 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the largest sustained ice loss from early 2003 to mid-2013 came from Greenland's southwest region, which is mostly devoid of large glaciers.

Greenland, the world’s biggest island, appears to have hit a tipping point around 2002-2003 when the ice loss rapidly accelerated, said lead author Michael Bevis, a geoscientist at Ohio State University. By 2012 the annual ice loss was “unprecedented” at nearly four times the rate in 2003, Bevis said in an interview.

But now experts say a “climate penalty” is kicking in, with climate change worsening a key aspect of air quality: surface-level ozone. This ozone is especially damaging to the respiratory system, harming airways and making lungs susceptible to infection.

Air quality in the U.S. 30 years from now will be similar to that of the early 2000s—rather than the better air we have today, according to a report released in February by the research firm First Street. The causes of the bad air are rising ozone due to warmer temperatures along with climate-induced wildfires, which are expected to increase in frequency and severity. (The smoke from these fires increases tiny inhalable particulate matter known as PM2.5.)

Both will lead to more days of unhealthy air.

As surface-level ozone worsens, more than 400 counties in the U.S. that do not currently suffer any poor-air-quality days will experience them in the coming years, according to the First Street report.

Heat waves—already three times more frequent and lasting longer than in decades past—are especially conducive to troublesome ozone spikes. Belching factory smokestacks and black smoke pouring from muscle-car tailpipes made the air unsafe to breathe in parts of the United States before legislation passed in the 1960s and the following decades helped reversed the trend. But now experts say a “climate penalty” is kicking in, with climate change worsening a key aspect of air quality: surface-level ozone. This ozone is especially damaging to the respiratory system, harming airways and making lungs susceptible to infection.

Half of All Species Are on the Move—And We're Feeling It,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/climate-change-species-migration-disease,04-27-2017,"As climate change displaces everything from moose to microbes, it’s affecting human foods, businesses, and diseases.","The shrubs probably responded first. In the 19th century, alder and flowering willows in the Alaskan Arctic stood no taller than a small child—just a little over three feet. But as temperatures warmed with fossil fuel emissions, and growing seasons lengthened, the shrubs multiplied and prospered. Today many stand over six feet.

Bigger shrubs drew moose, which rarely crossed the Brooks Range before the 20th century. Now these spindly-legged beasts lumber along Arctic river corridors, wherever the vegetation is tall enough to poke through the deep snow. They were followed by snowshoe hares, which also browse on shrubs.

Today moose and hares have become part of the subsistence diet for indigenous hunters in northern Alaska, as melting sea ice makes traditional foods like seals harder to chase.

World leaders must increase their commitments to conserving land and water, and quickly, if a stable climate and high quality of life are to be preserved in the near future, a new scientific study argues.

Countries should double their protected zones to 30 percent of the Earth’s land area, and add 20 percent more as climate stabilization areas, for a total of 50 percent of all land kept in a natural state, scientists conclude. All of this needs to be done by 2030 to have a real hope of keeping climate change under the “danger zone” target of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) and to prevent the world’s ecosystems from unravelling—according to an ambitious plan called the Global Deal for Nature.

AMUNDSEN SEA, ANTARCTICA — After a month of sailing the great Southern Ocean, during which there was a nine-day medical evacuation, after a few days digging ditches on a remote island chain searching for ancient penguin bones, after the sea sickness medications and the seal tagging, the test missions of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and the start of an international ping pong tournament, after all that the R/V Nathaniel B Palmer and the fifty-six people who currently call this sturdy ship home, arrive at our destination: Thwaites Glacier. The night prior I woke occasionally in eager anticipation, each time opening my polyester curtain to see if I could make out the ice front through the fog. Finally, at five, I pull on multiple layers of long underwear and head to the bridge where, in the gloaming, a few others had gathered to cast their gaze on the great glacier’s seaward edge, a view that no human being had ever before seen.

For a while we speak in hushed tones, as though we are in a roofless cathedral. A wild line twists along the top of the ice front drawing torqued gorges into the blue-white snow. Slabs of compressed ice balance precariously over the sea. Some parts of Thwaites look like a glacier coming undone, while other sections are steep and sturdy and sheer. Over 100 miles long, it takes us hours and hours to sail its length. Throughout the day the scientists and crew members on board cycle through the bridge to take a look.

Those who have spent time at Antarctica’s other iconic ice sheets—Ross Island and Pine Island in particular—note immediately that Thwaites looks different, and not in a good way. Some point to how the ice slumps at the edges, “like snow sliding off a roof,” others call it “mangled,” “gnarly,” and “undulatory.” Each noting how the ice here behaves in unusual ways.

For a while we speak in hushed tones, as though we are in a roofless cathedral. A wild line twists along the top of the ice front drawing torqued gorges into the blue-white snow. Slabs of compressed ice balance precariously over the sea. Some parts of Thwaites look like a glacier coming undone, while other sections are steep and sturdy and sheer. Over 100 miles long, it takes us hours and hours to sail its length. Throughout the day the scientists and crew members on board cycle through the bridge to take a look.

Those who have spent time at Antarctica’s other iconic ice sheets—Ross Island and Pine Island in particular—note immediately that Thwaites looks different, and not in a good way. Some point to how the ice slumps at the edges, “like snow sliding off a roof,” others call it “mangled,” “gnarly,” and “undulatory.” Each noting how the ice here behaves in unusual ways."
Here's what made Hurricane Katrina one of the worst storms in U.S. history,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/hurricane-katrina,08-29-2024,"With winds reaching as high as 120 miles per hour, the Category 3 storm devastated New Orleans and coastal Louisiana—and its effects are still felt today.","Hurricane Katrina made landfall off the coast of Louisiana on August 29, 2005. It hit land as a Category 3 storm with winds reaching speeds as high as 120 miles per hour. Because of the ensuing destruction and loss of life, the storm is often considered one of the worst in U.S. history. An estimated 1,200 people died as a direct result of the storm, which also cost an estimated $108 billion in property damage, making it the costliest storm on record.

The devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina exposed a series of deep-rooted problems, including controversies over the federal government's response, difficulties in search-and-rescue efforts, and lack of preparedness for the storm, particularly with regard to the city's aging series of levees—50 of which failed during the storm, significantly flooding the low-lying city and causing much of the damage.

The city's Lower Ninth Ward was impacted the most from levee failure, leaving a disproportionate number of low income and African American families as victims. Many of those who lost their homes faced years of hardship and the area is still working to recover today. Hurricane Katrina made landfall off the coast of Louisiana on August 29, 2005.

Here’s What It’s Like to Be Stateless,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/the-stateless-among-us,11-17-2014,Ten million people alive don’t belong to any country. Here’s what life is like. …,"When whistleblower Edward Snowden gave his first interview to American media in May, one of his chief laments was that, with his passport deactivated and threat of jail time in the United States, he had turned into a stateless person. From his apartment in Moscow, where he is neither a citizen nor allowed to stay any longer than his visa can be renewed, he claimed he simply has no viable place to go.

As a complaint, Snowden’s lament is sad. But in context, Snowden, in a secure apartment in a developed capital city, has it far better than others. According to the United Nations and its refugee arm, the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, there are more than 10 million people worldwide. This amounts to a new stateless baby born every 10 minutes. They’re born with no country, no documentation, little social support, and hardly any opportunity to advance.

Statelessness is a simple concept, although the causes are less clear. Sometimes war and conflict drive people from their homes. Other countries with poor social institutions can’t provide the paperwork or documents needed to travel abroad. One on hand, stateless people tend not to be charged taxes. They’re frequently exempt from unfair regulations or things like military drafts. Yet living off government rolls also deprives them from protection under the law, leaving them susceptible to abuse and under threat of being deported—to where isn’t always clear.

Here’s Where the Arctic’s Wildlife Will Make Its Last Stand,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/arctic-wildlife-sea-ice,12-19-2017,"Forecasters say the region’s sea ice will dwindle to a strip above Greenland and Canada. There, polar bears and others will fight to survive.","This story appears in the January 2018 issue of National Geographic magazine.

We see evidence of the kill first: a shockingly broad spread of scarlet, probably the blood of a ringed seal, on snow-covered sea ice. Then the polar bear appears. She’s big, maybe 500 pounds, trailed by a single cub. They’ve just jumped into a lead—a long fissure of open water in the frozen sea. In seconds they’re out of the water again, running across the ice, spooked by the approach of our helicopter. Prolonged running can harm polar bears: Fat and fur insulate them so well they risk overheating. François Létourneau-Cloutier, our 33-year-old Québécois pilot, takes us higher, and the mother and cub slow to an amble.

After following them for several minutes, Létourneau-Cloutier sets the helicopter gently onto the ice a few hundred feet away and cuts the engine. The mother rises on her hind legs, assessing our 35-foot-long flying machine with the unruffled gaze of the Arctic’s top predator; the cub remains on all fours behind her. For a few timeless moments we savor the scene—bears against an otherwise empty immensity of snow and ice, countless shallow pools of meltwater reflecting a high summer sun ringed by faint halos of red and blue. Then, with a frenzied whine, the helicopter’s rotor blades break the spell, and we lift off, veering southwest toward our campsite on the northernmost tip of Baffin Island, Canada, about 700 miles north of Hudson Bay.

Within a few decades such vistas are unlikely to exist, at least not here, during summer. As the planet heats up, the summer sea ice and all the superbly adapted life it supports—the bears, the seals, the walruses, the whales, the Arctic cod, the crustaceans, the ice algae—may well vanish around Baffin. As we fly over the vast frozen expanse, it almost strains belief to think that we’re witnessing—and with the rest of humanity, helping to cause—its demise. In the 1980s satellite data showed that Arctic sea ice extended on average across nearly three million square miles at the end of summer. Since then more than a million square miles has been lost—an area roughly the size of Alaska, Texas, and California combined.

Here’s Why Your Office May Be Too Hot or Cold: Gender Bias,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/150803-gender-bias-affects-office-heating-cooling-temperatures,08-03-2015,"Do you argue about the temperature in your office or home? Find out what often decides it, and tell us your preference.","Many couples fight about it at home. No, it’s not money, sex, or parenting but the lowly thermostat. Heated arguments often ensue about how warm or cool to keep a room. New research suggests why women may lose out—at least at the office.

Gender bias may affect the heating and cooling in office buildings, and it’s no Mars vs. Venus misunderstanding. Temperatures are often based on a decades-old standard that considers the metabolic rate of men, according to a study Monday in Nature Climate Change.

This bias isn’t just about equity or comfort. It has real-world climate implications, because it could waste a lot of energy that emits heat-trapping greenhouse gases. After all, buildings account for nearly a third of carbon emissions, and their energy use is largely determined by occupant behavior. Many couples fight about it at home.

Here’s how extreme heat is hurting pregnant women,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/heres-how-extreme-heat-is-hurting-pregnant-women,08-25-2022,"As the world gets hotter, scientists are documenting a spike in preterm and still births, along with underweight babies.","On hot summer days in Kilifi, a largely rural coastal county in Kenya, air temperatures soar to 100 degrees Fahrenheit and rarely drop below 70. “This place has always been hot,” says medical anthropologist Adelaide Lusambili at the Aga Khan University in Nairobi, “but now it’s very hot.”

Like many other parts of the world, Kenya is witnessing a rise in annual temperatures, accompanied by more frequent, intense, and longer heatwaves and reduced periods of cooling. Such acute and sustained heat poses a particular problem for pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to it. As the world gets hotter, scientists are seeing a spike in stillbirths, along with early or underweight births.

Last summer, Lusambili and her colleagues interviewed pregnant women and new mothers, their family members, healthcare workers, and community leaders in Kilifi to understand how extreme heat was affecting maternal and newborn health. One healthcare worker told them that they were seeing more birth complications and more early births.

A growing body of scientific research supports this observation by suggesting hotter-than-usual daytime temperatures and warmer nights may be leading to an increase in adverse outcomes for pregnant women. These range from greater risks of stillbirth—when the baby is born dead after at least 20 weeks gestation—to higher chances of a preterm birth, in which the baby is born before 37 weeks rather than the full-term of 40-weeks.

Some studies suggest that higher temperatures led to more lower-weight newborns, which can result in health complications for the infant. A recent analysis of 70 studies set in 27 countries, including the United States, China, a few European, and Sub-Saharan African nations, showed that for every 1.8 degree Fahrenheit rise in temperature, the risks of preterm and stillbirths jumps by 5 percent.

The news is almost never good, Elizabeth Kolbert, the environmental scribe and thinker, has observed over years writing about the planet. Every year, scientists warn time is running out to reel back emissions. And each year, the world emits about three to five percent more greenhouse gases. In the western nations that burn the most fossil fuels, what needs to be done vs. what is being done are almost completely opposite.

For more than a decade, since Al Gore’s overhead-projected An Inconvenient Truth, we’ve been told to turn down our thermostats and stop flying on airplanes. The way to save the planet is to change your light bulbs and to buy a more efficient car, or better yet, to stop driving entirely. A few years later, food activists told us to eat food grown nearby, to stop overfishing the oceans, and to stop pouring huge quantities of water, land, and grain into raising meat.

Here’s how to recognize the toll the temperature is taking on your body—and what to do about it.,"Recent weeks have seen record-breaking heat on three separate continents. The United States clocked the largest number of heat warnings ever, parts of China simultaneously roasted, and Europe’s temperatures spiked so high residents unofficially dubbed the heat wave Cerberus, for the monster in Dante’s Inferno.Thanks to climate change, these blazing firsts—including Earth’s average hottest day, on July 3rd—will likely soon be surpassed, so it’s important to understand the ways heat damages the human body and how to prevent them, says Kurt Shickman, director of extreme heat initiatives at the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center in Washington, D.C. “Heat is extremely dangerous, and climate change will make more areas prone,” he says.Whether extreme temperatures can hurt—and sometimes kill—involves numerous factors. The thermometer is key, of course, but humidity matters too, because humans primarily cool our bodies through the evaporation of sweat. Although this technique works well for the dry African savannas where humans evolved, it’s much less effective in swampy Washington, D.C., subtropical South Florida, and many other parts of the U.S., says W. Jon Williams, a heat health expert at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Humidity is accounted for in the heat index or feels like temperatures on weather apps.)It doesn’t take long for heat to injure the body, which is why recognizing the signs of heat illness—and knowing the actions one must take—can save lives.

Heat rash develops within hours on humid daysHeat rash, also known as prickly heat, are small, pimple-like blisters that erupt when sweat trapped under tight clothing can’t evaporate so pores become clogged. The rash generally appears on the chest, neck, and/or armpits when a shirt is snug, or around the breasts or groin if a bra, shorts, or underwear are tight. Recent weeks have seen record-breaking heat on three separate continents. The United States clocked the largest number of heat warnings ever, parts of China simultaneously roasted, and Europe’s temperatures spiked so high residents unofficially dubbed the heat wave Cerberus, for the monster in Dante’s Inferno.Thanks to climate change, these blazing firsts—including Earth’s average hottest day, on July 3rd—will likely soon be surpassed, so it’s important to understand the ways heat damages the human body and how to prevent them, says Kurt Shickman, director of extreme heat initiatives at the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center in Washington, D.C. “Heat is extremely dangerous, and climate change will make more areas prone,” he says.Whether extreme temperatures can hurt—and sometimes kill—involves numerous factors. The thermometer is key, of course, but humidity matters too, because humans primarily cool our bodies through the evaporation of sweat. Although this technique works well for the dry African savannas where humans evolved, it’s much less effective in swampy Washington, D.C., subtropical South Florida, and many other parts of the U.S., says W. Jon Williams, a heat health expert at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Humidity is accounted for in the heat index or feels like temperatures on weather apps.)It doesn’t take long for heat to injure the body, which is why recognizing the signs of heat illness—and knowing the actions one must take—can save lives.

Here’s what it takes to ice climb Kilimanjaro,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/ice-climbing-kilimanjaro-tanzania,01-14-2020,"As glaciers melt, this adventure is becoming a rare experience.","This story appears in the February 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.

On Kilimanjaro, most climbers go straight for the Tanzanian mountain’s famous summit. But those who take the more dangerous western route have found glaciers up to 100 feet tall. These ancient frozen masses are tropical anomalies—ice doesn’t often last long near the Equator. The sun’s rays cause the foot of a glacier to melt first, leading to calving, breakaways, and, sometimes, stand-alone towers of ice (pictured above). Kilimanjaro’s ice climbing can be some of the best on Earth, says climber Will Gadd. One reason to go soon: These glaciers—like glaciers everywhere—are melting.

Getting in shape

Any attempt on this mountain requires serious physical and mental preparation. To build fitness, starting at least half a year in advance, Gadd suggests daily weight and cardio workouts paired with a diet of whole foods and lean red meat. During training climbs, he advises, explorers should be alert to warning signs like sustained winds or impending rain.

Essential packing list

High-quality gear is the key to both enjoying ice climbs and surviving them, Gadd says. He’s adamant about taking the following:

Sharp crampons that attach securely to boots
Handheld ice claws
A helmet, in case you fall or ice falls on you
Gloves that are flexible and warm
A jacket that repels water and blocks wind
Rope and safety harness: “Never skimp on these.” This story appears in the February 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Here’s what worries engineers the most about U.S. infrastructure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/most-dangerous-infrastructure-problems,07-17-2023,"Water and sewer systems built in the mid-19th century weren't meant to handle the demands of modern cities, and many bridges and levees have aged well past their intended lifespan.","Christine Kirchhoff’s family were preparing to move into a new house when Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in 2017. Then the massive storm dumped 50 inches of rain on the area in just a few days, leaving two nearby reservoirs so full that their operators were forced to open the floodgates. Kirchhoff’s family had to be evacuated by boat. Both their original and new houses were inundated.

As an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Pennsylvania State University, Kirchhoff spent a lot of time thinking about water even before it swallowed her family’s livelihood. She is part of the legion of professionals behind the complex, often invisible systems that support American life: dams, roads, the electric grid, and much more.

For the last 25 years, the American Society of Civil Engineers has been sounding the alarm on the state of that infrastructure across the country. In their most recent assessment, for example, transit scored a D- and hazardous waste a D+. It’s an expensive problem to ignore. The ASCE estimates current infrastructure conditions cost the average family $3,300 a year. “Everyone is paying whether they know it or not,” Kirchhoff says.

Hidden Costs of Climate Change Running Hundreds of Billions a Year,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/climate-change-costs-us-economy-billions-report,09-27-2017,"A new report warns of a high price tag on the impacts of global warming, from storm damage to health costs. But solutions can provide better value, the authors say.","Extreme weather, made worse by climate change, along with the health impacts of burning fossil fuels, has cost the U.S. economy at least $240 billion a year over the past ten years, a new report has found.

And yet this does not include this past month's three major hurricanes or 76 wildfires in nine Western states. Those economic losses alone are estimated to top $300 billion, the report notes. Putting it in perspective, $300 billion is enough money to provide free tuition for the 13.5 million U.S. students enrolled in public colleges and universities for four years.

In the coming decade, economic losses from extreme weather combined with the health costs of air pollution spiral upward to at least $360 billion annually, potentially crippling U.S. economic growth, according to this new report, The Economic Case for Climate Action in the United States, published online Thursday by the Universal Ecological Fund.

Hidden landscapes reveal how humans have reshaped the planet,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/edward-burtynsky-photos-shows-how-humans-have-reshaped-the-planet,03-25-2020,"For every “great creation,” humans have wrought “a greater act of destruction,” says this photographer.","This story is part of the pessimistic argument for the future of the planet in our special issue on Earth Day. Read the optimistic argument and the rest of our stories here.

I captured this image in the potash mines below Berezniki, a Russian town in central Siberia. Most people don’t have the visual or verbal vocabulary to really understand what’s happening beneath the ground in that remote place. And until I visited it myself and felt the pressure of more than a thousand feet of solid earth and rock and life above me, neither did I.

This is a landscape that was never meant for human eyes. The light of the sun will never reach it. And yet the materials extracted here—destined to fertilize immense farms in the United States and elsewhere—are an essential ingredient in the production of food that sustains the world’s booming population.

To arrive at this place—a 6,000-mile network of tunnels in utter uninhabitable darkness—my crew and I descended in an elevator large enough for some 40 miners and their equipment. It was foggy; the damp air would soon chill us to the bone. At the bottom of the shaft, we boarded trucks, the only illumination coming from the vehicles’ headlights and our headlamps. Although I’d worked in a gold mine before I became a photographer, this experience was unsettling. The tunnels would split and split again and then split yet again. I began marking our path with an X. If our lights burned out, we would be lost and no one would hear our calls. Voices fade away quickly underground.

And yet it was beautiful down there amid the brightly colored layers of an ancient seabed—the orange striations of the potash, the undulating lines created by the intense pressure of the earth above. The nautilus-shell impressions, however, were made by a machine. The miners call it a combine; it excavates tunnels with spinning discs on two arms. When the combine reverses course, it carves these medallions into the rock.

Those impressions, and the tunnels themselves, are markers of the Anthropocene, a possible new geologic age defined by human activity. Scientists call such alteration to Earth’s rock and sediment “anthroturbation.” Long after our cities have been overgrown by forests, these tunnels will remain as clues to our existence, much as the cave paintings of Lascaux tell us of people who lived 20,000 years ago. This story is part of the pessimistic argument for the future of the planet in our special issue on Earth Day. Read the optimistic argument and the rest of our stories here.

I captured this image in the potash mines below Berezniki, a Russian town in central Siberia. Most people don’t have the visual or verbal vocabulary to really understand what’s happening beneath the ground in that remote place. And until I visited it myself and felt the pressure of more than a thousand feet of solid earth and rock and life above me, neither did I.

This is a landscape that was never meant for human eyes. The light of the sun will never reach it. And yet the materials extracted here—destined to fertilize immense farms in the United States and elsewhere—are an essential ingredient in the production of food that sustains the world’s booming population.

To arrive at this place—a 6,000-mile network of tunnels in utter uninhabitable darkness—my crew and I descended in an elevator large enough for some 40 miners and their equipment. It was foggy; the damp air would soon chill us to the bone. At the bottom of the shaft, we boarded trucks, the only illumination coming from the vehicles’ headlights and our headlamps. Although I’d worked in a gold mine before I became a photographer, this experience was unsettling. The tunnels would split and split again and then split yet again. I began marking our path with an X. If our lights burned out, we would be lost and no one would hear our calls. Voices fade away quickly underground.

And yet it was beautiful down there amid the brightly colored layers of an ancient seabed—the orange striations of the potash, the undulating lines created by the intense pressure of the earth above. The nautilus-shell impressions, however, were made by a machine. The miners call it a combine; it excavates tunnels with spinning discs on two arms. When the combine reverses course, it carves these medallions into the rock.

Those impressions, and the tunnels themselves, are markers of the Anthropocene, a possible new geologic age defined by human activity.

High consumption by some nations puts all of us at risk,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/inequality-rich-poor-essay-jared-diamond,11-27-2018,"Life on Earth is threatened by climate change, nuclear attack, dwindling resources—and the chasm between rich and poor.","This story appears in the December 2018 issue of National Geographic magazine.

The world’s richest countries, such as Luxembourg and the United States, have average incomes per person about 100 times higher than in the poorest countries, such as Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That’s a tragedy for poor countries. Is it also a looming tragedy for rich ones?

Until recently all those poor people elsewhere were no threat to rich countries. “They” out there didn’t know much about our lifestyle—and even if they did and became angry, they couldn’t do anything about it.

But today, poor remote countries are able to create problems for rich ones, and the reasons can be summed up in a word: globalization. As a result of the increased connections among all parts of the world, people in developing countries know more about differences in living standards, and many of them can now travel to rich countries.

Globalization has made it untenable for such dramatic inequalities between high and low living standards to persist. I see evidence of that everywhere, but three examples stand out. This story appears in the December 2018 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Climate change may actually benefit some plants by lengthening growing seasons and increasing carbon dioxide, the lifeblood of anything that roots in the ground. Yet it’s important not to get distracted by these changes, which researchers think would be marginally beneficial at best. The other effects of a warmer world, such as more pests, droughts, and flooding, will be far less benign. A 2013 study published by Science magazine says, “The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply.”

Trying to understand what that means for farmers requires an equation as complicated as the climate itself. So not long ago, I visited a typical American farm growing the most typical of all American crops: corn.

In Oakland, Iowa, A 78-year-old farmer named Mark Gardner drove me around his farm, explaining the ins and outs of commodity farming. Mark doesn’t grow designer corn that he sells at farmers markets or to high-end food stores. On his 1,000 acres, he grows the same corn (and some soybeans) as everyone around him and sells it for the same price as everyone else, determined by the commodity markets. He buys new seeds every year, plants it and harvests it with the help of a forest green combine. Then he hopes—or perhaps prays—that the sun shines and the rain pours enough to keep it growing, producing, decomposing, and then growing again.

Saying no when Fido gives you his best “puppy-dog eyes” can be extremely difficult. For thousands of years, dogs have been cajoling people by making this pitiful, adorable expression—an ability that may be the result of selective breeding, a new study says.

Tiny muscles around the eyes and mouth enable terrestrial mammals to form myriad facial expressions. Those muscles are more similar in dogs and humans than in dogs and wolves, says the study by researchers from Pittsburgh’s Duquesne University. In wolves, most of the facial muscles are slow-twitch fibers, which adjust less rapidly, while in humans and domesticated dogs, most of the muscles are fast-twitch fibers, which react quickly. It’s this musculature difference that allows dogs to make puppy-dog eyes and other animated, humanlike expressions that wolves can’t.

Communicating with facial cues is “fundamental to all humans,” says study lead author Anne Burrows. “So it seems reasonable that we would have selected dogs during selective breeding that would gaze into our eyes.” Burrows and colleagues are now investigating whether the evolution of fast-twitching muscles around dogs’ mouths played a role in the barks they developed to communicate. —Annie Roth Speaking eye to eye

That day he was headed on a 60-mile roundtrip to an area where many locals go to get firewood. Trailing behind his skidoo, as Canadians call it, was a sled with a mobile sensor that continually measured the thickness of the ice underneath him—to alert him when he might be in danger of falling through it.

Late one quiet November night in the village of Niaqornat, 300 miles above the Arctic Circle on Greenland’s west coast, the sled dogs began to howl. No one knew for sure, but some of the villagers suspected the dogs had heard the exhalations of narwhals. The whales with the spiral unicorn tusks usually swim into Uummannaq Fjord this time of year as they migrate south. The next morning most of the community’s men set out in small boats to try to bag a narwhal, as the Inuit in Greenland have done for centuries—though in this area nowadays they throw harpoons from motorboats moving at 30 knots and finish off their quarry with high-powered rifles.

That afternoon, beneath a lowering gray sky, the hunters return, dragging their boats ashore. A few more of Niaqornat’s 50 residents emerge from brightly painted wooden houses and gather on the stony beach, eager to see what the boats might hold. Among them is Ilannguaq Egede, the 41-year-old manager of the village power plant. He came here nine years ago from south Greenland, where sheep farmers far outnumber whalers, to be with a Niaqornat woman he met on an Internet dating site. “I haven’t caught my first narwhal yet,” he says. “I’m waiting for this season.”

Now a culture that has evolved here over many centuries, adapting to the seasonal advance and retreat of sea ice, is facing the prospect that the ice will retreat for good.

Maybe the narwhals eluded their pursuers. Or maybe they were never there and are still lingering in their summer grounds up north, not yet driven south by spreading sea ice. Whatever the reason, Niaqornat’s hunters have returned with smaller prey: ringed seals, a dietary staple. Within minutes the animals have been skinned, the meat cut and carried away in plastic bags. Bite-size slices of raw liver have been handed to delighted children. Aside from some bloodstained rocks and a few severed flippers, all traces of the seals have vanished.

How Reducing Food Waste Could Ease Climate Change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/150122-food-waste-climate-change-hunger,01-23-2015,The energy used to produce wasted food generates more than 3.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.,"More than a third of all of the food that's produced on our planet never reaches a table. It's either spoiled in transit or thrown out by consumers in wealthier countries, who typically buy too much and toss the excess. This works out to roughly 1.3 billion tons of food, worth nearly $1 trillion at retail prices.

Aside from the social, economic, and moral implications of that waste—in a world where an estimated 805 million people go to bed hungry each night—the environmental cost of producing all that food, for nothing, is staggering. (Read more about causes and potential solutions to the problem of food waste.)

The water wastage alone would be the equivalent of the entire annual flow of the Volga—Europe's largest river—according to a UN report. The energy that goes into the production, harvesting, transporting, and packaging of that wasted food, meanwhile, generates more than 3.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. If food waste were a country, it would be the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind the U.S. and China. (Read about the author who's waging a war against global food waste.) More than a third of all of the food that's produced on our planet never reaches a table. It's either spoiled in transit or thrown out by consumers in wealthier countries, who typically buy too much and toss the excess. This works out to roughly 1.3 billion tons of food, worth nearly $1 trillion at retail prices.

Aside from the social, economic, and moral implications of that waste—in a world where an estimated 805 million people go to bed hungry each night—the environmental cost of producing all that food, for nothing, is staggering. (Read more about causes and potential solutions to the problem of food waste.)

How U.S. Climate Plan Can Follow China and Europe—Or Not,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/150814-US-climate-plan-lessons-from-China-Europe,08-14-2015,How U.S. Climate Plan Can Follow China and Europe—Or Not,"The United States aims to lead other countries with its climate plan. Yet one of its key but lesser-known tools, carbon trading, has already taken root across the globe.

In the last decade, 17 “cap and trade” systems—covering 35 countries and a dozen states or provinces—have sprung up to curb global warming. They cap total emissions of heating-trapping carbon dioxide but allow emitters to trade pollution allowances.

Such a trading system gets new life in President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan—in somewhat backdoor fashion. Five years ago, Obama failed to get a controversial cap-and-trade bill passed in Congress. Now, states can opt to launch a market or join existing ones in California and the Northeast.

Most of these have proved to be hype and VR remained little more than a fad, popular with video gamers. But in his new book, VR: Experience On Demand, Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of the Virtual Human Interactive Lab at Stanford University, insists that VR is at last coming of age, with new applications from conservation to the treatment of PTSD.

When National Geographic caught up with him by phone from Stanford, Bailenson explained how VR is now being used to raise awareness about climate change, help quarterbacks memorize plays for the NFL, and even help first 9/11 responders suffering from PTSD.

When I interviewed Jaron Lanier, the pioneer of VR, two decades ago, he was ecstatic about its potential. Recently he said the digital “hive mind” threatens to lead us into “social catastrophe.” Which is right?

Jaron is a great colleague of mine. He and I have published papers together and we talk a lot about VR as a tool to make people better, for collaboration and expression. The thing to remember is that VR is a medium. Just like the written word, just like video, and it all depends on what we do with it. Throughout his long, amazing career, Jaron has been someone who pushes us to use technology for good, to think about how to use avatars to make people more collaborative, to reduce prejudice, and increase productivity.

How a Seal Pup Died With a Plastic Wrapper in Its Stomach,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/seal-plastic-death-climate-change-animals,05-31-2018,A flimsy film of plastic clogged the sick pup’s intestines and could have catalyzed its death.,"This story is part of Planet or Plastic?—our multiyear effort to raise awareness about the global plastic waste crisis. Learn what you can do to reduce your own single-use plastics, and take your pledge.

A little piece of plastic is all it takes to destroy an animal’s life.

Last Friday, a dead harp seal pup was found on the island of Skye and brought to the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, a government-funded organization that investigates mortality in marine mammals. There, veterinary pathologist Andrew Brownlow necropsied the corpse and pulled a small, crucially placed square of plastic out of its stomach. He posted about the case on the SMASS Facebook page on Wednesday.

The animal was likely eight months to a year old. Brownlow says it’s unusual to find plastic debris inside a seal stomach—seals more often become entangled by fishing nets, lines, and lures and die that way, rather than being killed by small floating plastic debris.

How a Teen's Day at the Beach Turned Into a Climate Breakthrough,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/chasing-genius-ethan-novek-carbon-xprize-innovator-energy,06-30-2017,Ethan Novek's brainstorm led him to research at Yale while he was still in high school.,"Transformational ideas can come from anywhere.

Check out the challenge, where the best ideas for improving our world each can win $25,000.

Ethan Novek was digging a hole in the sand at a beach in Connecticut when he noticed something that got him thinking. The seawater that seeped into the hole was rising at the same rate as the tides offshore. What if that seepage could be harnessed for energy in wells onshore, rather than out in the trickier ocean environment?

That idea kicked off the first in a chain of experiments that eventually landed Novek at Yale University, leading a research project while he was still in high school. Starting after that summer at the beach before his freshman year, Novek ran successive experiments at his school's lab. By the time he was a sophomore, he had arrived at a simple and economical way to capture carbon dioxide from the air and convert it into useful products. He recently became a semifinalist in the $20 million NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE.

In conversation, Novek is almost breathless as he describes his research. There's a lot to cover. His ""weird route,"" as he calls it, from that seaside brainstorm to carbon capture began with filing a patent for a tidal energy system, which then led him to research the energy potential of salinity gradients between freshwater and ocean water, which led him to explore parallel reactions between ammonia and carbon dioxide. Fully appreciating his rapid-fire account of the multiple threads of inquiry that led to his carbon capture idea might require an advanced education in chemistry.

Arrival

Ride up a mountain: The Jungfraujoch research station looks rugged and isolated—and it is—but beneath its windswept stones lie an ice palace, a chocolate shop, and the highest train station in Europe. Like the travelers, Punkka rode a cogwheel train from Kleine Scheidegg through a tunnel under the mountain to get there. After he disembarked, he stepped into a high-speed elevator. It shot him up to the research station on top of the peak where he, unlike the tourists, was allowed to bunk with the scientists for four days.

Bundling up: Punkka dressed for early spring in the Alps—in down, fleece, and multiple layers.

Boots for deep snow
Camera with three lenses
Snow pants (warm enough to let him lie on the ground while photographing wildlife)

To save rivers, scientists suggest paying farmers to not farm.","It’s not exactly news that the rivers of the western U.S. are in trouble.

For decades, their water has been siphoned off by climate change-fueled heat and an ever-growing human demand for grassy front lawns and long showers. The biggest user of river water by far, though, is agriculture—and new research shows that across the western United States, a third of all consumed water goes to irrigate crops not for human consumption, but that are used to feed beef and dairy cattle. In the Colorado River basin, it’s over 50 percent.

The burgers, steaks, yogurt, and ice cream Americans eat in abundance, the new results show, is directly related to the overuse of river water—leaving the ecosystems and communities that depend on those rivers drastically stressed under even the best of circumstances. During bad drought years, the stress ratchets up on many western rivers, nudging over 50 species of fish closer to extinction or imperilment, estimates the study, published this week in Nature Sustainability.

Even the most forward-thinking cities have a long way to go to neutralize their carbon emissions, the report says. That’s partly because for years, cities have been doing carbon math wrong, adding up only the carbon costs that occur within city limits. But much of city dwellers' climate impact actually comes from the things they eat, use, or buy that originate far outside the city—from food to clothes to electronics and more.

To keep emissions in check, the report suggests, cities should aim to trim their carbon emissions by 50 percent in the next 11 years, and then by a total of 80 percent by 2050. And because, as the researchers found, a hefty portion of those emissions can be traced back to consumer goods, food, and energy produced outside city limits, one of the best things cities can do is help their residents pull back on consumption.

And because, as the researchers found, a hefty portion of those emissions can be traced back to consumer goods, food, and energy produced outside city limits, one of the best things cities can do is help their residents pull back on consumption."

They were coughing, rubbing their stinging eyes, and having asthma attacks. For people who live in fire-prone areas, each new fire may be increasing their risk of stroke or heart attack. 

People with HVAC systems and air filters usually can protect themselves by staying inside, but wild animals have no escape. As years of poor forest management and climate change cause fires to grow in size and intensity, it’s become increasingly important to understand how smoke affects animals, so that scientists can identify the most vulnerable species and determine whether they need management or conservation plans. Yet little is known about how wildfire smoke affects animals, and scientists are scrambling for answers. 

“There are so many big question marks,” says Olivia Sanderfoot, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington who published a study on October 19 in Environmental Research Letters reviewing the existing research on how wildfire smoke affects animals. She found just 41 studies, most from the past 20 years.

But paradoxically, the most intense wildfires can have the opposite effect on temperatures, cooling Earth’s surface both regionally and globally.

Dense wildfire smoke can temporarily block sunlight near the ground, causing regional temperatures to drop by several degrees. Wildfire smoke can also have global cooling effects by making clouds in the lower atmosphere more reflective or blocking sunlight in the upper atmosphere, similar to what a volcanic eruption does.

Scientists have only recently begun studying these effects, with Australia’s record  2019-2020 bushfire season marking the first time researchers detected wildfire smoke-induced global cooling. The effect is far too small to counteract human-caused global warming, but beyond that, researchers say it’s too early to predict what it means for the broader climate system.

Here’s how extreme heat affects us—and what to keep in mind to stay safe.","Last summer as a searing heat wave rolled in, the Spanish city of Seville did something unexpected. Officials treated the three-day heat event as they might a hurricane or massive wildfire—they named it. The coming of Heat Wave Zoe triggered public service announcements urging precautions to avoid dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke—and death.

Naming a heat wave is part of a recent effort to bring attention to the physical and mental-health dangers of extreme heat. Each year, grueling temperatures kill more people than other weather conditions, both in the U.S. and globally. Last summer, for example, hundreds died during the four-day broiler in the Pacific Northwest. More attention might persuade people not to ignore the heat—staying outside or continuing exercising al fresco.

“When the news cameras turn up after a hurricane or tornado, the damage is evident. But heat’s effects are mostly hidden,” says Kurt Shickman, director of the extreme heat initiative at the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center, the organization helping Seville as well as Miami, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Athens, and others.

Recognition of heat’s damaging effects has become more urgent with climate change, which is leading to more frequent and longer heat waves worldwide. That awareness is particularly important now as above-normal temperatures are predicted for much of the U.S. this summer. “Bringing more attention to heat is part of our climate resilience strategy,” says Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. The recent heat wave in India, for example, was made 30 times more likely by climate change.

Official estimates say an average of 700 Americans die annually from extreme heat, but experts call that a gross undercount. Many people succumb to a heart attack, asthma, or kidney disease exacerbated by heat whose death certificates don’t reflect the weather’s contribution. Even accidents might be tied to heat. “Maybe an outdoor worker falls off a ladder because the heat made them dizzy,” says Jane Gilbert, the chief heat officer of Miami-Dade—one of a handful of people in the country with this title.

Protecting large, charismatic animals like whales is often seen as a sort of charity work individuals and governments do on behalf of nature. A team of economists led by Ralph Chami, an assistant director of the IMF’s Institute for Capacity Development, wanted to change the way we think about whales by quantifying the benefit they provide us in dollars and cents. Their new analysis, detailed in a recent article in the trade publication Finance & Development, is a first-of-its-kind attempt to do just that.

The analysis hasn’t yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific paper, and there are still important scientific knowledge gaps in terms of how much carbon whales can capture. But based on the research that’s been done so far, it’s clear to the economists that if we protect great whales, it will reap major dividends for the planet. The world’s largest whales are more than mere evolutionary marvels. By sequestering carbon in the ocean, they can help humanity fight climate change—an ecosystem service that may be worth millions of dollars per whale, according to a new analysis by economists with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The world’s oceans already act as a vast carbon sink, offsetting approximately one-quarter of the CO2 emissions that human activity generates each year. But as they face challenges like acidification and rising temperatures, they’re becoming less effective at taking up the planet-warming gas. 

Engineers at Captura, a startup spun out from the California Institute of Technology, have devised a process that’s meant to revive that drawdown. Working like a large-scale desalination plant, it takes in ocean water, keeps a tiny portion aside, and zaps it with electricity using a special machine.

The end of spring is usually the time to assess the annual Mount Everest climbing season, but this year, because of COVID-19, the mountain was unusually quiet. Nepal banned all expeditions on its side. China banned foreign mountaineers but allowed Chinese nationals to climb from the Tibet side, including a team of surveyors attempting to remeasure the mountain’s height in the wake of the 2015 earthquake.

But while most of the climbing world took a break from Everest, a group of scientists in labs spread across Europe, the U.S., and Nepal have been working on the mountain “remotely”—analyzing a trove of ice, snow, water, and sediment samples they collected last spring as part of the National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Everest Expedition. The project's goal was to turn the world’s highest mountain into a giant climate laboratory.

Climate scientist Paul Mayewski holds a section of one of the ice-cores extracted from the upper slopes of Mount Everest. The cores were transported to labs at the University of Maine where portions will be melted and analyzed for clues to changes in the environment over time.

Accuweather predicts the Midwestern states will experience the extreme temperatures until later this week and cautions against stepping outside with any exposed skin. In these record-shattering temperatures, frostbite can occur after only a few minutes.

Traditional, soil-depleting farming practices for the country’s staple crop of rice are taking their toll on the land and the creatures that live on it. Certain varieties of cacao, on the other hand, are not heat tolerant; fruit and hardwood trees are mixed in with cacao trees to provide shade. This method, called agroforestry, though practiced, is going through a renaissance in a bid to encourage more cacao farming and to improve yields.

But what if companies could make money from carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas that's the main contributor to global warming?

We're not actually so far off from turning emissions into commodities, it turns out. In the United States alone, a number of companies aim to convert waste carbon dioxide into chemicals that can be used to make products we buy every day: bleach, baking soda, car seats, diapers, even fuel. What's more, these companies aren't just green do-gooders. They're all on the verge of commercialization and aim squarely at making money.

Dams, climate change, and other issues have wreaked havoc on salmon along the U.S. West Coast, and the declines have been particularly acute for the spring-run fish, which migrate farther upstream and so are more likely to have been cut off from their habitat by the dams."
Huge iceberg breaking up off South Georgia Island is still a threat,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/world-largest-iceberg-a68-heading-for-south-georgia-wildlife,12-28-2020,What effects on wildlife and the ecosystem the icebergs will have are unknown.,"Update: As of today, the A68 iceberg, once the world’s largest, has lost significant chunks of ice and continues to break apart, satellite images show. On December 17, about 69 square miles broke from the iceberg, forming A68d. On December 22, the front, pointed tip of the iceberg broke, producing 68-square-mile A68e and 252-square-mile A68f. Since the iceberg calved from the Larsen C ice shelf three years ago, it has lost two-thirds of its volume. Recent satellite images show that the icebergs are caught in a strong ocean current that seems likely to sweep the chunks of ice around the southern edge of the island and spin them north. It’s unclear whether the remainder of A68 and its siblings will become stuck there and cut South Georgia’s wildlife off from feeding grounds, but the chunks of ice are rapidly releasing freshwater into an ecosystem adapted to saltwater.What was the largest iceberg on Earth is threatening to come to a halt soon in a pristine Antarctic wildlife sanctuary that’s home to penguins, seals, and a small population of endangered blue whales.The iceberg, labeled A68, broke off from the Larsen C ice shelf on the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula in 2017. It had been slowly inching north until this year, when an ocean current quickly propelled it into the Southern Atlantic Ocean.

Human Emissions Made Ocean Heat Wave 53 Times More Likely,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/carbon-dioxide-emissions-drive-ocean-heat-waves-global-warming,01-16-2018,"Three 2016 marine heat waves that killed whales, birds, corals, and shellfish from Australia to Alaska were many times more likely thanks to climate change.","The consequences for Alaska were stark: dozens of whales died, as did thousands of common murres and tufted puffins, while sealife native to the tropics came up in nets pulled from sub-Arctic seas.

But an unusual mass of warm water nicknamed ""the blob,"" which appeared off Alaska and hung around through 2016, didn't occur in isolation. In northern Australia in 2016, high ocean heat bleached hundreds of miles of corals, killed mangroves, and destroyed giant clams. Off New Zealand, an ocean hot spell wiped out black abalone and brought an oyster-killing disease.

Just as atmospheric shifts can bring droughts and nasty heat waves on land, shifts in weather or ocean circulation also can spark deadly marine heat waves, which can thoroughly scramble life at sea. But until recently scientists understood little about what role climate change might play in these extreme sea events.

"Human migration sparked by wars, disasters, and now climate",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/migration,02-28-2019,"Homo sapiens have been on the move from almost their beginnings. Climate-caused floods, drought, and water shortages will likely join the list of reasons to migrate.","Migration is defined as “movement from one country, place or locality to another.” Ever since the earliest humans began to spread from Africa, humans have been on the move. Even today, 3 percent of the world’s population—at least 258 million people—live outside of their country of origin. Whether voluntary or forced, migration has profoundly shaped our world.

First migrants

The earliest migrants were ancient humans who originated on the African continent. Their spread to Eurasia and elsewhere remains a matter of significant scientific controversy. The earliest fossils of recognizable Homo sapiens were found in Ethiopia and are approximately 200,000 years old.

The “out of Africa” theory posits that around 60,000 years ago, Homo sapiens dispersed across Eurasia, where they met and eventually replaced other human ancestors like Neanderthals. However, that theory has been challenged by evidence of migrations from Africa to Eurasia 120,000 years ago. Either way, early humans are thought to have migrated to Asia either across a strait that lies between the Horn of Africa and what is now Yemen, or via the Sinai Peninsula. After spreading to southeast Asia, early humans are thought to have migrated to Australia, which shared a landmass with New Guinea at the time, then to Europe, then to the Americas.

And he was quite good at fishing.”

They couldn’t afford a boat, so they’d wade into the water up to their chests to see what fish—tilapia, carp, catfish—had swum into their nets overnight. “We had a lucky catch that day,” Mwaura said. “But before we got the full catch, the hippo came again.”

Humanity left an irreversible imprint upon Earth's rocks.

At first it looked like a piece of Styrofoam, with a pencil-sized groove cut along its surface. But on closer inspection the slab proved as hard as rock: It was a piece of coral cut from Flinders Reef, a towering undersea formation some 150 miles off the east coast of Australia.

Flinders is the kind of secluded place you’d think would preserve pristine nature. The immediate area “is devoid of the usual human influences—tourism, agricultural runoff, and industrial pollution,” says Zinke, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom.

That may make the reef an ideal spot to illustrate the concept that humans are changing the Earth not just locally but globally—and in geologically lasting ways. Since World War II, rapid increases in the human population and in our industrial and agricultural activity have created what’s been called a “Great Acceleration” in human impact.

"Humans, not glaciers, likely doomed Ice Age cave bears",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/humans-not-glaciers-wiped-out-ice-age-cave-bears-ancient-dna-shows,08-15-2019,Analysis of genetic material from dozens of prehistoric bears shows that their decline neatly matches the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe.,"Neanderthals lived in Europe for thousands of centuries, and during that time, they had to watch their step. Mammoths, woolly rhinos, and saber-tooth cats were common in the region, and the caves these human relatives would sometimes enter for shelter were often already occupied by cave bears, the heaviest adults of which may have weighed over 2,000 pounds.

Today, controversy swirls around the question of why all these large animals eventually disappeared. Some scientists think they were victims of the last glacial maximum, which peaked around 26,500 years ago. Other experts have argued that the appearance of a new human species with a knack for hunting, Homo sapiens, could have driven the unfortunate beasts to extinction.

Now, research presented in the journal Scientific Reports suggests that in the case of cave bears, humans most likely played a crucial role. Neanderthals lived in Europe for thousands of centuries, and during that time, they had to watch their step. Mammoths, woolly rhinos, and saber-tooth cats were common in the region, and the caves these human relatives would sometimes enter for shelter were often already occupied by cave bears, the heaviest adults of which may have weighed over 2,000 pounds.

Today, controversy swirls around the question of why all these large animals eventually disappeared.

Humpback whales face a major setback from climate change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/humpback-whales-face-a-major-setback-from-climate-change,06-08-2022,"The iconic whales are recovering from near extinction, but warming seas could force them away from historic breeding grounds.","After largely recovering from decades of overhunting, one of the most iconic whale species may be at risk from climate change, as warming waters could force it away from its traditional breeding grounds in the tropics.

According to a new study published in Frontiers in Marine Science, projected sea surface temperature increases mean that many humpback whale breeding areas would no longer be within their historic temperature range by century’s end. Combined with warming of their feeding grounds, as well as the impacts from other human activities, such changes may mean that, even after years of recovery, humpbacks’ future remains far from secure.

Perhaps the most familiar of the great whales, with long pectoral fins and a penchant for leaping clear of the water—a behavior known as breaching—humpbacks are also famed for their lengthy, complex, and haunting songs. Because they swim primarily in coastal waters, humpbacks were easy and early prey for commercial whalers, who began targeting them in the 16th century and killed roughly 250,000 in the 20th century alone, reducing the global population to a few thousand. Even as some other whale populations have recovered slowly or not at all, humpbacks have rebounded strongly throughout their range.

The catastrophic rains accompanying Hurricane Florence along the U.S. East Coast can be blamed squarely on climate change, new research shows. The rainfall was projected to be more than 50 percent worse than it would have been without global warming, a team of scientists said before the storm made landfall. The hurricane’s size was predicted to be about 50 miles (80 kilometers) wider for the same reason. In parts of North Carolina, as much as 30 inches of rain has already been recorded, setting a state record for the highest rainfall received from any one storm.The reason: warmer ocean and atmospheric temperatures, caused by the warming Earth.The slow-moving storm pushed storm surges as high as 10 feet onto the shore when it makes landfall Friday morning. It was described as one of the worst hurricanes to hit the coastal Carolinas since Hurricane Hugo battered Charleston in September 1989. But it is the potential for days of drenching rainfall, already causing flooding, that has officials most worried.

While having a cyclone travel with less speed may seem like a good thing, it's actually just the opposite.

"Hydropower, explained",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/hydropower,05-13-2019,Learn about the benefits and pitfalls of generating electricity from waterways.,"Humans have been harnessing the energy of river currents for centuries, using water wheels spun by rivers initially to process grains and cloth. Today, hydropower provides about 16 percent of the world's electricity, generating power in all but two U.S. states.

Hydropower became an electricity source in the late 19th century, a few decades after British-American engineer James Francis developed the first modern water turbine. In 1882, the world’s first hydroelectric power plant began operating in the United States along the Fox River in Appleton, Wisconsin.

How hydropower works

A typical hydroelectric plant is a system with three parts: a power plant where the electricity is produced, a dam that can be opened or closed to control water flow, and a reservoir where water is stored. The water behind the dam flows through an intake and pushes against blades in a turbine, causing them to turn. The turbine spins a generator to produce electricity.

What’s tricky is accessing a tusk’s chemical composition and interpreting it.

No-Melt Ice Cream

Scientists have found a solution to sticky ice-cream hands—entirely by accident. After the 2011 tsunami damaged Japanese strawberry fields, the fruit was too unsightly to be sold whole. Pharmacy professor Tomihisa Ohta and his team at Kanazawa University thought they had a solution: They would make an extract from the strawberries—liquid polyphenol—that could be used as a new dessert topping. When they added polyphenol to cream, though, it solidified instantly, making it useless as a topping—but perfect as a binding agent. They’d inadvertently created a frozen dessert that doesn’t melt. Kanazawa ice-cream pops, which stay frozen for an hour at room temperature, are now sold throughout Japan. —Natasha Daly

For a number of vision problems, the artificial intraocular lens (IOL) above may be the solution. Also called an iris clip, the ultrathin lens is attached to the eye’s iris using a tiny incision. This eye belongs to a 70-year-old man; after a cataract surgery failed, the IOL restored his vision almost fully. —Lori Cuthbert

The foxes might outpace the tortoises which might outpace the trees. In the process, the ecological deck is shuffled.

In February 2019, a  “mass invasion” on the Russian Arctic archipelago of Novaya Zemlya trapped people in their homes while several dozen bears wandered the town. In 2018, two separate attacks in the Canadian province of Nunavut resulted in the deaths of two men; in 2021 a bear attacked and injured three people in the same region before it was killed.

In 1845 explorers sought the Northwest Passage—then vanished,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/sir-john-franklin-searched-for-northwest-passage-then-vanished-feature-article,08-08-2019,The failed expedition was one of the grimmest chapters in the history of Arctic exploration. Researchers aim to shed light on its mysterious fate.,"For centuries the Northwest Passage seemed little more than a mirage. John Cabot urged his ships into the unknown in 1497 and 1498 to find it, but failed. Martin Frobisher, Henry Hudson, and James Cook searched icy northern waters for it, in vain. In May 1845 a celebrated British explorer and naval officer, Sir John Franklin, took up the quest to find a route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through Arctic waters. With orders from the British Admiralty, Franklin and a crew of 133 sailed out from the Thames in two massive naval vessels, H.M.S. Erebus and H.M.S. Terror, each specially equipped for polar service. It was the beginning of the grimmest disaster in Arctic exploration.

On paper, the expedition seemed to lack for little. The crew was young, tough, and seasoned. The ships, sheathed in iron, bristled with the latest Victorian-era technology—from steam engines to heated water and an early daguerreotype camera. The vessels carried more than three years’ worth of food and drink, as well as two barrel organs and libraries with some 2,900 books. Two dogs and a monkey kept the men company in their quarters.

But these small floating worlds were no match for the Arctic’s frozen seas. On Admiralty orders, the expedition sailed to one of the most treacherous, ice-choked corners of the far north. By September 1846, both vessels were imprisoned in sea ice northwest of King William Island. They remained so for at least a year and a half of brutal polar cold.

Bad heat and bad air together can cause particularly dangerous conditions for vulnerable communities across California, a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds. Heat and ozone work in tandem to increase the stress on people’s bodies and increase their risk of hospitalization.

August Torment OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA — A wildfire pollution sky is the color of dirty porcelain and it glares, so your eyes hurt even before you look up. It’s the smell that really gets you, though. That and the sour scrape in your throat. From my house in Oakland we can’t quite see the nearest fires—we scan the horizon for them, obsessively, but so far this week we see fire only in the photos and videos coming at us nonstop. Fat black plumes. Burning fields. House walls, county roads, children’s play structures, all engulfed in flames.

This season, however, few skiers get to enjoy the view. Though Austria is re-opening its ski lifts on Christmas Eve—two days before the whole nation goes into another lockdown against COVID-19—hospitality services remain closed. Effectively, only locals will be leaving their tracks in the fresh, powdery snow, while hundreds of thousands of foreign skiers are shut out.

Vladimir Putin looked a little pixelated from the satellite uplink. Alexey Miller, CEO of Russia’s energy giant Gazprom, stood stiffly facing the screen and the Russian president. Outside the room the clusters of prefab buildings and shiny pipes were lit up like a space station floating in the darkness. Bovanenkovo is one of the largest natural gas deposits on Earth. Miller asked Putin for the order to start pumping from a new field there.

“You may begin,” said Putin.

Miller relayed the message; an engineer tapped a key. With that, Arctic gas began flowing down a 700-mile pipeline into Russia’s sprawling network. The Yamal Peninsula, a thumb of flat tundra jutting north into the frozen Kara Sea, was known until recently for its nomadic reindeer herders, the Nenets, and under Joseph Stalin for its brutal prison camps. But by 2030, Gazprom estimates, the region will supply more than a third of Russia’s gas production and a lot of its oil. Bovanenkovo is one of more than 30 known gas and oil deposits on the peninsula or just offshore. Yamal could become an Arctic Saudi Arabia funneling hydrocarbons to an energy-hungry world. Or so Putin hopes.

As global warming thaws the Arctic, Russia is leading the rush to exploit the region’s resources. In late 2013, on a platform in the Pechora Sea, Gazprom became the first company to produce oil offshore in the Arctic, after jailing 30 Greenpeace protesters and confiscating their ship. On the east side of Yamal a partnership led by another Russian company, Novatek, is building a giant terminal to liquefy gas and export it to East Asia and Europe by ice-breaking tanker—though over time there may be less and less ice to break.

Some pundits have called on India, the world’s third largest greenhouse gas emitter, to announce its own emissions target and take a lead role at the international climate negotiations. While some of these actions are within India’s reach, the pundits miss the point.

India today is a major contributor of greenhouse gases, but it’s not reasonable to put the country in the same class as the United States or China. Looking at per capita emissions, India produces at about 2 tons CO2e per capita—a fraction of the 20 tons CO2e in the U.S. or even the 8 tons CO2e in China. In 2030, India’s projected per capita emissions are expected to be below the world average. In addition, India’s cumulative historical emissions are 3 percent of the world total, far below 11 percent for China and 27 percent for the United States. (See related story: “In Climate Talks, Spotlight Turns to India.”)

It’s not just a sense of obligation to the international community, economic self-interest should motivate India to pursue to a low-carbon trajectory.

Grow Heathrow started as a protest site. Campaigners created the space to support the local community’s fight against a proposed third runway at London’s Heathrow airport. In 2010, activists reclaimed nearby derelict land and, though the soil was full of dumped toxins, they gradually nurtured it back to health. Now, this disused scrubland has transformed into an ecovillage of 25 residents with strong roots in the local community.

She moved through the local outdoor market in search of a few more pieces of equipment, trailed by a local college student holding a calculator and two porters dragging a wooden cart. It was a treasure hunt.

In recent years, global warming and climate change have been the subject of a great deal of political controversy, especially in the U.S. But as the science becomes clearer and consensus grows impossible to ignore, debate is moving away from whether humans are causing warming and toward questions about how best to respond.

Evidence of rising temperatures is pervasive and striking: Thermometer records kept over the past century and a half show Earth's average temperature has risen more than 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius), and about twice that in parts of the Arctic.

Is your favorite ‘green’ product as eco-friendly as it claims to be?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/what-is-greenwashing-how-to-spot,11-22-2022,Not all environmental claims are created equally. Here’s how consumers can spot misleading labels.,"Going green is good for business. Consumers are often willing to pay more for eco-friendly products than other comparable products on the market, according to market research. 

But not all environmental claims are created equally. “Greenwashing” is a form of misinformation often used to entice an aspiring green consumer. Companies promising to be sustainable, biodegradable, or environmentally conscious sometimes fail to meet the promises they make to consumers. 

“It’s basically just a form of lying,” says Ellis Jones, a sociologist who studies greenwashing at the College of the Holy Cross.  Going green is good for business.

That extra heat can’t accrue without consequence. Two new reports confirm that 2016 was the hottest year on record—and demonstrate that human activity made the freakish heat far likelier than it otherwise would have been.

It’s official: Groundhog Day’s spring predictions no better than chance,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/groundhog-day-predictions-of-spring-no-better-than-chance,02-02-2022,"A lighthearted study of spring flowers’ blooming times confirms that groundhog soothsaying is essentially a cute, furry coin flip.","The idea behind Groundhog Day is as simple as it is eccentric. Every February 2—the halfway point between the winter solstice and spring equinox—a bleary-eyed groundhog is hoisted from its burrow into the daylight in towns across the United States and Canada. If its human handler proclaims that the rodent sees its shadow (as Punxsutawney Phil did this year), then six more weeks of winter await; if it doesn’t, spring will come early—or so the tradition goes.  

Each year, the date’s approach is met with gleeful anticipation and sometimes a rewatching of the movie that made the day globally famous. Each year, the groundhogs’ “proclamations” are reported with mock seriousness. The occasional tongue-in-cheek assertion to the contrary—for example, General Beauregard Lee from Jackson, Georgia, self-reports an accuracy rate of 99 percent—few would make the case for groundhog divination as a substitute for long-range meteorology.

To verify whether groundhogs might be weather soothsayers, a team of researchers from Lakehead University in Ontario, Canada, decided to take a cold, hard look at the evidence. It was, admits lead author Alex Ross, a project that was born in the campus bar (“There were many conversations over many beers,” he confesses to National Geographic), and given extra impetus by the boredom of a pandemic.

When the lake freezes over, daily temperature changes cause the ice to expand and contract, cracking the surface and forcing it upward into a ridge.* Legend has it that the ridge, called the omiwatari, is formed by the feet of the Shinto gods as they cross the lake. Every year since at least 1443, the priests who live at the shrine on the edge of Lake Suwa have carefully recorded the date the ridge appears.

In 1693, on the other side of the world, a Finnish merchant named Olof Ahlbom started recording the date and time of the spring ice breakup on the Torne River, which forms part of the border between Sweden and Finland. Though Ahlbom’s recordkeeping was interrupted in 1715, when he had to flee a Russian invasion, he resumed it after he returned home in 1721, and it has been carried on by other observers ever since.

When scientists want to glimpse the climate of the ancient past, they almost always have to use indirect evidence—changes in tree rings, ice-core layers, or pollen deposits.

At the start of the period, the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea continued and accelerated. Laurasia, the northern half, broke up into North America and Eurasia. Gondwana, the southern half, began to break up by the mid-Jurassic. The eastern portion—Antarctica, Madagascar, India, and Australia—split from the western half, Africa and South America. New oceans flooded the spaces in between. Mountains rose on the seafloor, pushing sea levels higher and onto the continents.

All this water gave the previously hot and dry climate a humid and drippy subtropical feel. Dry deserts slowly took on a greener hue.

Laundry: lightening the load,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/partner-content-laundry-lightening-the-load,11-10-2017,A host of innovations have meant that laundry’s no longer as much of a chore—but convenience comes at a cost.,"In any given week, around 840 million washing machines soak, tumble, and spin billions of garments and textiles in homes and businesses around the world. Since they were first popularized in the 1950s, washing machines have become more or less ubiquitous for two billion human beings according to famed data analyst Hans Rosling. And those numbers are projected to rise dramatically as incomes increase and more and more people move to urban centers.

Washing machines have made the hard labor of weekly wash days a thing of the past—at least for those who can afford them. But like so many of the innovations that make our lives easier, there is a cost to the environment. Besides using around 19 billion cubic meters of water annually, washing machines emit an estimated 62 million tonnes of CO2-eq greenhouse gases each year. That’s not all on the machines themselves though—indeed, modern washing machines have made significant strides in both water and energy efficiency in recent years. In fact, consumer choices are fundamental to significantly reducing both water and electricity usage associated with laundry.

Of course, the impact of laundry isn’t confined to households or businesses—you also have to take into account the detergent we put in our machines, how it gets to us, and what happens to it after we’ve used it. This kind of comprehensive data on the impacts of products and services is often generated via a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Working with the Energy Saving Trust, a social enterprise focused on energy sustainability, Ariel has done a considerable amount of research on the impact of its detergents to figure out how to minimize the environmental impacts of washing clothes and textiles without compromising performance. In any given week, around 840 million washing machines soak, tumble, and spin billions of garments and textiles in homes and businesses around the world. Since they were first popularized in the 1950s, washing machines have become more or less ubiquitous for two billion human beings according to famed data analyst Hans Rosling. And those numbers are projected to rise dramatically as incomes increase and more and more people move to urban centers.

Washing machines have made the hard labor of weekly wash days a thing of the past—at least for those who can afford them. But like so many of the innovations that make our lives easier, there is a cost to the environment. Besides using around 19 billion cubic meters of water annually, washing machines emit an estimated 62 million tonnes of CO2-eq greenhouse gases each year. That’s not all on the machines themselves though—indeed, modern washing machines have made significant strides in both water and energy efficiency in recent years. In fact, consumer choices are fundamental to significantly reducing both water and electricity usage associated with laundry.

"Leonard DiCaprio on Interviewing Obama, the Pope",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/3-questions-leonardo-dicaprio,10-19-2016,The actor traveled the world for a new documentary on the threats of climate change.,"This story appears in the November 2016 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Leonardo DiCaprio likes to say that he makes his living in made-up worlds. The Oscar-winning actor, 41, has played an 1820s frontiersman, a 1920s tycoon, and a 1960s con man. Now DiCaprio, a UN messenger of peace, has produced a documentary about a very real concern: climate change, and the need for government action. He shot Before the Flood all over the world—this time playing himself.

Before the Flood airs Sunday, October 30, at 9/8c on National Geographic.

Whom do you hope to reach with the film?

We all have a role to play in saving our planet. This film is meant to educate everyone, from global leaders to everyday citizens, on the threat of climate change. There are practical steps we all must take—today—to hasten the adoption of renewable and clean-energy technologies across the planet. For the film we interviewed inspiring figures, from Pope Francis and President Obama—who both have the ability to galvanize millions of people—to activists like Sunita Narain, a tremendous voice in India who’s calling for her country to be part of a global solution.

How can an issue like climate change attract more sustained attention?

There is no issue this important—because the future of the planet is at stake. We have no planet B. The energy we focus on solving climate change and the pressure we place on global leaders to lead on the question will help create a sustainable and livable environment for the long term.

You traveled around the world for this film. What message do people have for Americans?

We need to vote for leaders who understand the serious issues impacting our climate—and for leaders who believe in the undeniable truth of science. No nation or society is immune from the symptoms of climate change. America is in many places already feeling the impacts of it: droughts in California, rising seas in Miami, more extreme storms in the Gulf of Mexico. We can still prevent these crises from becoming a widespread challenge in the future of our country. We have an opportunity to lead the world on one of the most crucial issues of all time.

Less than 3 percent of the ocean is 'highly protected',https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/paper-parks-undermine-marine-protected-areas,09-25-2019,"Despite a flurry of declarations about marine protected areas, world leaders are struggling to put these vital conservation measures into practice.","Countries earn a lot of media buzz for announcing bold plans to section off thousands of square miles of ocean for protection. That’s because scientists say these Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are effective tools to protect the marine plants and animals facing threats from ocean acidification, heatwaves, overfishing, and pollution.

MPAs can provide benefits like protecting endangered species or helping replenish fish stocks that spill into neighboring fisheries. The most highly regulated parks have the most benefits. And according to a report released on Wednesday by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), unabated emissions will have severe impacts on biodiversity.

But for MPAs to actually reach the level of protection needed to mitigate those impacts of climate change, experts say the UN will have to think much more critically about how they regulate those areas and what will happen to countries that fail to deliver on their promises. If a park remains in limbo for too long—stuck between declaration and implementation—it may be referred to as a “paper park” by conservation groups but will still face little international pushback.

Lightning struck near the North Pole 48 times.

Lightning requires atmospheric instability, something that’s set up when cold, parched air sits atop warmer, wetter air. At very high latitudes, that hotter, damper air tends not to show up.

That’s why it took scientists by surprise when dozens of lightning strikes were detected within 300 nautical miles of the North Pole this past weekend. In fact, it was so unusual that it was highlighted on Twitter by the National Weather Service’s office in Fairbanks, Alaska. A bulletin of theirs said this was “one of the furthest north lightning strikes in Alaska forecaster memory.”

Although plenty of factors needed to come together to produce the lightshow, the specter of climate change lingers over this meteorological mystery. It is possible that a freakishly warm Arctic, a staggering lack of sea ice, and even possibly smoke from unprecedented wildfires within the Arctic Circle, among other things, contributed to this lightning’s unexpected appearance near the top of the world.

You’ve read the statistics about how agricultural production uses 30 percent of the world’s energy and produces 22 percent of greenhouse gasses. Yet nearly every nation, when they get enough money, seems to want to consume more meat (see Carnivore’s Dilemma). And, then there’s the related health problems associated with eating too much animal fat.

To address this, back in 2003, a Madison Avenue marketer straight out of Mad Men named Sid Lerner and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health started Meatless Monday, challenging people to go without meat for one day a week.

While the meat industry likes to point out that the movement is small, and it was small at first—it’s grown to include top chefs (Mario Batali), school systems (Baltimore county), celebrities (Oprah and Paul McCartney), and ordinary citizens in some 36 countries. National Geographic’s cafeteria even offers 5 percent off meatless meals on Mondays.

Making the change: breaking our fossil fuel habit,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/partner-content-breaking-our-fossil-fuel-habit,04-13-2020,"With fossil fuels powering climate change, including global warming, a cultural change driven by education is needed to speed up the transition to renewable energy.","An iceberg melts in the Arctic; saltwater seeps into the Florida Everglades, the sun bakes a lakebed in Bolivia, trees die in the mountains of Germany, and bush fires sweep across southwest Australia. Although thousands of miles apart, these events are connected: they have all been intensified by climate change primarily caused by our burning of fossil fuels. Since ancient times, humans have burned wood, peat, and oil for heating, cooking, and light. In the U.S., as elsewhere, coal powered the industrial age until the discovery of vast amounts of underground petroleum in the mid-19th century. American industrial might was built on energy derived from fossil fuels—the decomposed remains of plants and animals found in the Earth’s crust. These fuels contain carbon and hydrogen, and it is carbon that is the problem.

Mammoth-elephant hybrids could be created within the decade. Should they be?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/mammoth-elephant-hybrids-could-be-created-within-the-decade-should-they-be,09-13-2021,A new startup co-founded by Harvard geneticist George Church wants to use cold-adapted elephants to remake the Arctic tundra—raising major scientific and ethical questions.,"Harvard geneticist George Church has co-founded a new company with an audacious goal: engineer an elephant that resembles the extinct woolly mammoth. The company, named Colossal, aims to use woolly mammoth DNA to make a hybridized Asian elephant that could thrive in Arctic climates. 

Using these hybrids, Colossal’s long-term goal is to convert swaths of today’s mossy tundra into the grassy steppes they once were during the Pleistocene epoch, the period of multiple ice ages that ended 11,700 years ago. Some scientists hypothesize that at large scales, this reversal could reduce future climate change by slowing the thaw of Arctic permafrost. Along the way, Colossal hopes to create new—and lucrative—biotechnologies, including tools that would supplement traditional conservation approaches.

“We’re de-extincting genes, not species,” Church says. “The goal is really a cold-resistant elephant that is fully interbreedable with the endangered Asian elephant.” Harvard geneticist George Church has co-founded a new company with an audacious goal: engineer an elephant that resembles the extinct woolly mammoth.

Mapping Southern California’s history of oil extraction and spills,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/mapping-southern-california-history-of-oil-extraction-and-spills,10-08-2021,The Southern Coast of California is home to an active oil and gas industry and a legacy of environmental disasters.,"Along the Southern California coast, tens of thousands of oil wells are sitting next to scenic beaches, dotting coastal mountains, and even occupying residential blocks of urban Los Angeles. Platforms on the Pacific Ocean pull oil from deep-sea wells and send it to the mainland via pipelines on the seafloor. Onshore and off, California's oil and gas industry persists, despite state goals to cut back carbon emissions and a legacy of numerous environmental disasters.

Southern California's biggest coastal oil spillsIn terms of volume, the recent pipeline leak near Huntington Beach (at least 126,000 gallons of crude oil released) pales in comparison to some of Southern California's previous environmental disasters.Decades of leaks discovered under dunesAfter ceasing operations in 1994, it was discovered that pipelines at the Guadalupe Oil Field had been leaking diluent—a product that helps move oil through pipes—for perhaps four decades. An estimated 12 million gallons of the substance had been released underground into nearby dunes, beaches, the groundwater, and the Pacific Ocean. Along the Southern California coast, tens of thousands of oil wells are sitting next to scenic beaches, dotting coastal mountains, and even occupying residential blocks of urban Los Angeles. Platforms on the Pacific Ocean pull oil from deep-sea wells and send it to the mainland via pipelines on the seafloor. Onshore and off, California's oil and gas industry persists, despite state goals to cut back carbon emissions and a legacy of numerous environmental disasters.

Marine Protected Areas Are Important. But Are They Working?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/marine-protected-areas-ocean-conservation-environment,06-16-2018,"The world won't meet international ocean conservation targets by 2020, so a team of scientists is looking at what's next for saving our seas.","Every year National Geographic brings together explorers, scientists, and storytellers from around the world to share their discoveries and insights—along with their solutions for creating a more sustainable future.

You can think of a marine protected area like a boost of vitamin C taken at the onset of a cold. It may not cure you, but it can help you bounce back.

“A [protected] ecosystem tends to be more resistant to disturbance and it's more resilient—it comes back faster,” says Jane Lubchenco, now a marine ecologist at Oregon State University and formerly the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “It's not unlike your body. If you are immunocompromised, you're much more likely to come down with a cold or flu.”

These protected ocean spaces, when defended well, won't solve all the problems in the world's oceans, but they might give us a fighting chance against afflictions like climate change or overfishing. Studies have shown that completely closing a portion of the ocean off to activities like fishing and drilling helps keep wildlife populations healthy and increases biodiversity.

Marine heat waves are on the rise. What are these blobs of hot water?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/marine-heat-waves-are-on-the-rise-what-are-these-blobs-of-hot-water,09-14-2022,"Climate change is causing intense warming of Earth’s oceans more often and for longer, posing big risks to the animals and plants that live there.","The water began warming in the Gulf of Alaska in late 2013. Within a few months, sea surface temperatures had increased by an average of 5 degrees Fahrenheit, and in places by as much as 7°F. Initially affecting an area of ocean approximately 500 miles across and 300 feet deep, by mid-2014 it had more than doubled in size before ultimately stretching 2,000 miles from Alaska to Mexico. Scientists called it the blob, an example of a phenomenon known as marine heat waves, and over the course of three years it turned the North Pacific ecosystem inside out and upside down.

Plankton and krill numbers crashed. Numbers of Pacific cod off Alaska diminished,= before ultimately the population collapsed. Starving sea lions washed ashore in their thousands, and massive numbers of seabirds died. Without krill to eat, humpback whales turned to anchovy, in search of which they swam closer to shore and became entangled in fishing gear. Humpback whale births also fell 75 percent in the subsequent six years. Toxic algal blooms shuttered crab fisheries. The food web shifted from one supported by tiny crustaceans to one dominated by nutritionally-poor gelatinous organisms called pyrosomes that had never been recorded so far north.

Marine heat waves are defined as sharp spikes of anomalously warm temperature that last at least five days, although many persist for weeks or months. Fueled by climate change-caused ocean warming they can impact marine ecosystems for years after the water has cooled again. As the effects of climate change become increasingly embedded around the world, marine heat waves are increasing in frequency and intensity—posing, says oceanographer Hillary Scannell, “a very big concern” for ocean environments.

Without krill to eat, humpback whales turned to anchovy, in search of which they swam closer to shore and became entangled in fishing gear. Humpback whale births also fell 75 percent in the subsequent six years. Toxic algal blooms shuttered crab fisheries. The food web shifted from one supported by tiny crustaceans to one dominated by nutritionally-poor gelatinous organisms called pyrosomes that had never been recorded so far north.

Marine heat waves are defined as sharp spikes of anomalously warm temperature that last at least five days, although many persist for weeks or months. Fueled by climate change-caused ocean warming they can impact marine ecosystems for years after the water has cooled again. As the effects of climate change become increasingly embedded around the world, marine heat waves are increasing in frequency and intensity—posing, says oceanographer Hillary Scannell, “a very big concern” for ocean environments."

The ocean around it was traversed by bony fish covered in armored plates and sea scorpions the size of modern humans.

Today those creatures are known from the fossil record: At the end of the Permian, 90 percent of all marine life was wiped out by the largest extinction event in Earth’s history. Scientists today suspect it was caused by massive releases of carbon dioxide, probably from volcanic activity in a region called the Siberian Traps. The most common cause of death, a team of researchers showed in 2018, was likely physiological stress from warming seas and oxygen loss, a byproduct of the climate change caused by greenhouse gases.

In a paper published today in the journal Science, two of the scientists who made that 2018 discovery argue that, if our own greenhouse emissions continue unchecked, warming waters and oxygen loss at sea could by themselves lead to a mass extinction rivaling the planet’s five worst catastrophes.

But there’s much more than meets the eye: Glaciers are home to a host of tiny organisms that make up a flourishing frigid ecosystem.

Most prominent among these in western North America are ice worms. Measuring about a half-inch in length and thin as threads of dental floss, ice worms (Mesenchytraeus solifugus) dot glaciers throughout the Pacific Northwest, British Columbia, and Alaska. Vast numbers of the tiny black worms emerge on summer afternoons and evenings to feed on algae, microbes, and other detritus on the surface. Then they burrow back into the ice at dawn—and during the winter, disappear into the frozen depths.

Mexico City is running out of water—are these cities next?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/major-cities-mexico-water-day-zero,06-14-2024,"Drought, urban development, and poor management are causing an unprecedented strain on urban water supplies across the world.","Record-breaking heat and years of mounting drought, capped last June by El Niño winds that cut the rainy season short, have pushed Mexico City’s water reservoirs into a historic deficit. As of this month, reservoirs sit at less than 27 percent capacity. 

The consequences in Mexico City have so far been devastating: more than 550 neighborhoods have had their tap water turned off or their water pressure reduced, according to one analysis of data from a local water authority. These water saving measures are forcing residents to fill whatever jugs they can gather at irregular and costly tanker deliveries. As summer begins, the megacity of 23 million is on the brink of disaster.

If heavy rains don’t arrive soon, in late June the city’s Cutzamala water system could reach “Day Zero,” a doomsday estimation that marks the moment the reservoirs will stop pumping. That means that in as much as a quarter of the city—even zones that have typically escaped water shortages—the taps would go bone dry. The aquifers where about 70 percent of the city’s water comes from will keep flowing, but they too are in danger.

BAJA CALIFORNIA, MÉXICO — Kicking up a cloud of dust, the caravan of pack burros and mules lurches toward the gate of the corral, trailed by a lean cowboy in a crisp white shirt whose spurs jangle in rhythm with his horse’s gait. At least three times a week, 34-year-old Eleonary “Nary” Arce Aguilar must drive down from his drought-stricken ranch to load up on critical water supplies that allow his family to stay on their ancestral land on the high mesa of Baja, México’s Sierra de San Francisco.

As the animals gulp from the trough, Nary takes a long drink from a PVC pipe that connects to a mountain spring eight miles away—a lifeline for the handful of ranches that survive in this remote pocket of the mountains. Nary spends most of an hour filling up five-gallon jugs and loading up his burros, getting a hand from his older brother, Ricardo, who manages the lower ranch. Then he swings back onto his mount and starts climbing home as the sun dips behind the ridgeline, casting the trail in shadow. Leer en español.

Midwest flooding is drowning corn and soy crops. Is climate change to blame?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/midwest-rain-climate-change-wrecking-corn-soy-crops,06-03-2019,This year's constant deluge of rain has led some to wonder if farmers are finally feeling the predicted impacts of a warming world.,"Seen from above, the Midwestern U.S. looks more like a marsh than the fertile fields that grow some of the nation’s most lucrative crops. That’s because this spring has been one of the rainiest on record for the region. As a result, many farmers have been forced to leave their fields empty.

And though it’s difficult to link one single weather event to climate change, climate scientists say the devasting rains falling over the Midwest are exactly in line with what they’ve been predicting.

“Overall, it’s climate change,” says Donald Wuebbles, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “We expect an increase in total precipitation in the Midwest, especially in winter and spring, with more coming as larger events.” Seen from above, the Midwestern U.S. looks more like a marsh than the fertile fields that grow some of the nation’s most lucrative crops.

Mining involves digging ore out of the ground, hauling it to processing plants, crushing it, separating and refining the metals, and then disposing of the waste.

More rainbows are in our future—and that’s a bad omen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/rainbows-climate-change-increase-myths-omen,11-29-2022,"In many cultures, rainbows traditionally signify risk instead of hope. That aligns with a new study that links climate change to more rainbows.","One morning a few years ago, at home in the Mānoa Valley on Oahu, scientist Kimberly Carlson looked out the window and saw a rainbow so bright and vibrant it took her breath away.

That wasn’t a shocker: Hawai’i is possibly the best place in the world to see rainbows today, and Mānoa has particularly ideal conditions for vibrant bows: Frequent rain showers and sunlight.

But Carlson, now an environmental sciences professor now at New York University, realized she didn’t know the answer to a simple question: Would climate change affect Hawaii’s—and the whole planet’s—breathtaking rainbows? She posited the question to some climate scientist colleagues, and it intrigued them so much they enlisted a class full of students to investigate. In November, they published their findings.

“Climate change is affecting rainbows—now we know that’s true,” says Carlson, the lead author on the paper, which used computer models to simulate future rainbow-ready conditions. As major weather patterns morph because of climate change, many parts of the world—particularly places nearer to the poles, like Alaska or Siberia, will get more rain—potentially adding dozens more rainbow-rich days by the end of the century.

“But there’s also a flip side,” she warns.

    “But as winter progressed, something seemed off,” says de Wit, whose lab is located in St. Petersburg. So far in 2021, more than 430 manatees have perished in Florida’s waters, almost triple the count for the same period the year before.Recent cold snaps forced these temperature-sensitive mammals to seek shelter in the warm waters of Indian River Lagoon, part of an estuary system that stretches from Ponce Inlet to Jupiter Inlet on Florida’s Atlantic coast. Most of the deaths have occurred in these waters, which are shallower and more sheltered than the ocean and thus warmer in winter.   Early this past winter, Martine de Wit noticed a spike in the number of manatees that were dying. At first, the veterinarian with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission attributed the surge to cold stress. De Wit was used to seeing some manatees sickened by the strain put on their sensitive bodies when water temperatures dip below 68 degrees Fahrenheit, as they did several times in December and January.

Most Americans now worry about climate change—and want to fix it,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/climate-change-awareness-polls-show-rising-concern-for-global-warming,01-23-2019,"New polls show recent disasters and personal experience have raised and widened global warming worries, but researchers warn of a huge gap between awareness and an adequate response.","This article was created in partnership with the National Geographic Society.

Two independent surveys of American attitudes on human-driven global warming, one focused on perceptions of risk, the other on possible responses, suggest a shift long sought by climate campaigners and scientists who’ve been pointing out rising danger for decades.

With a substantial surge in recent months, most Americans (outside of a small, but influential fringe, 7 percent, who dismiss the issue outright) have gotten well past the “is it happening” question on human-driven climate change. Nearly half in one survey said they would support a tax based on the amount of carbon in fuels that, when burned, generate the main climate-warming greenhouse gas emission, carbon dioxide.

The shift seems driven less by politician’s positions than recent disastrous heat-fueled wildfires, catastrophic hurricane strikes, and widening experience with changing climate conditions across the country. Both surveys were conducted late last year, when California’s latest burst of conflagrations was still in headlines and not long after a major new report from the United Nations climate panel offered a fresh round of warnings on the cost of delay in cutting heating emissions.

But in 2016, an eyebrow-raising idea ricocheted through the scientific community: It was possible, the authors said, that a warmer planet could push the towering ice cliffs at the fringes of the Antarctic ice sheet to essentially self-destruct, collapsing like a set of dominoes.

What was extra shocking was just how fast the ice could retreat under this runaway scenario, leading to about three feet of sea level rise fed from Antarctica alone by 2100—much faster than previous estimates, which generally proposed increases of only a few centimeters by the end of the century.

(See what the world would look like if all the ice melted.)

Now in its tenth year in the Arctic, Operation IceBridge is an airborne mission flown annually over both polar regions using various instruments to measure the changes to the ice sheets, ice shelves, and sea ice. And with global warming there are lots of changes in the polar regions. This past winter, the Arctic had 448,000 square miles (1.16 million square kilometers) less sea ice than it normally has in winter.

On Tuesday, China said it would halt the rise in its heat-trapping emissions within 15 years and would boost its share of non-fossil fuel energy use to 20 percent by 2030. Its commitment, similar to the one it made last year in a joint U.S. agreement, comes ahead of UN climate talks in Paris in December.

China’s goal reflects how quickly it’s becoming the world’s leader in solar power. It produces two-thirds of all solar panels, and last year, it added more solar capacity than any other country, according to the International Energy Agency or IEA. Germany still has the most cumulative photovoltaic capacity, but second-place China will likely soon close the gap.

Natural gas is a much ‘dirtier’ energy source than we thought,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/super-potent-methane-in-atmosphere-oil-gas-drilling-ice-cores,02-19-2020,"Coal, oil, and gas are responsible for much more atmospheric methane, the super-potent warming gas, than previously known.","In the thick of a Greenland summer of field work in 2015, Benjamin Hmiel and his team drilled into the massive ice sheet’s frozen innards, periodically hauling up a motorcycle-engine-sized chunk of crystalline ice. The ice held part of the answer to a question that had vexed scientists for years: How much of the methane in the atmosphere, one of the most potent sources of global warming, comes from the oil and gas industry?

Previously, geologic sources like volcanic seeps and gassy mud pots were thought to spit out about 10 percent of the methane that ended up in the atmosphere each year. But new research, published this week in Nature, suggests that natural geologic sources make up a much smaller fraction of the methane in today’s atmosphere. Instead, the researchers say, that methane is most likely attributable to industry. Added up, the results indicate we’ve underestimated the methane impacts of fossil fuel extraction by up to 40 percent.

That’s both bad news for climate change and good, says Hmiel, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the University of Rochester. Bad, because it means that oil and gas production has had a messier, bigger impact on the greenhouse gas budget than scientists knew. But Hmiel finds the result encouraging for almost the same reason: The more of the methane emissions that can be pinpointed to human activity like oil and gas extraction, the more control it means policymakers, businesses, and regulators have to fix the problem.

Although as a rainforest the Amazon historically has not burned on its own, deforestation over time has made the ecosystem drier, and fires have become common this time of year, which is normally marked by dry and cooler weather. Many fires are set by ranchers and farmers seeking to clear land for cattle grazing and agriculture. This year, however, satellite data from Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) has shown an increase of almost 85 percent in fires across the country from 2018, mostly in the Amazon region.The situation is particularly acute in northwestern Rondônia state, of which Porto Velho is the capital. Here, fires are up 190 percent from last year, INPE reports, despite weather conditions being roughly the same. The state is known as cattle country and is among the most deforested in Brazil. This year, ranchers appear to have set far more fires than in previous years and as a result, large swaths of the state have been burning, seemingly out of control. Update: The Group of Seven nations on August 26 pledged 18 million euros—over $20 million—to help combat fires raging in the Amazon rainforest. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro rejected the offer of help. The G7 is made up of the United States, Great Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and Italy.Porto Velho, Brazil — A popular hymn describes the sky above this Brazilian city of more than 400,000 people as forever blue. But this week, Porto Velho, along with much of the Amazon basin, has been shrouded in gray smoke as forest fires continue to rage across the region.

New Englanders May Soon See More Great White Sharks,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/great-white-shark-populations-rising-maine-new-england-spd,12-06-2017,"As Cape Cod populations increase, some sharks may be venturing as far north as Maine.","Maine may soon have more sharks in its waters. Nine species currently live in the region, but scientists believe great white sharks (made famous by the movie Jaws) could be making a comeback.

Questions remain over just how many could be moving back into northern waters and how climate change-induced warming waters could impact how long they stay.

New research first reported by the AP suggests great whites may be making Maine a new home. According to James Sulikowski, a scientist at the University of New England, great whites have been known to swim through waters off the coast of Maine, but relatively little data has been available on exactly how many there were or where they were going. Even less understood was whether or not their populations were increasing. Maine may soon have more sharks in its waters.

New Island Appears Off U.S. Coast,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/new-shelly-island-appears-cape-hatteras-north-carolina-coast-spd,06-27-2017,The sandy beach is littered with whale bones and ribs of old shipwrecks.,"It appeared out of nowhere in April just off North Carolina's Outer Banks—a new land mass poking through the surf, a brand new Atlantic Ocean island.

Along this dynamic stretch of sea, where the cold, southbound Labrador Current churns and crashes into warmer Gulf Stream waters, it is not unusual for patches of ground to emerge and then quickly subside. These are, after all, some of North America's roughest waters, a shallow region of swirling tides, hidden shoals, and harsh winds known to sailors as the Graveyard of the Atlantic.

Yet even for this place, this new formation is of a scale rarely seen. The crescent-shaped spit is close to a mile long. At its widest point, this island reaches a football field or more across.

"New Ocean Reserve, Largest in Africa, Protects Whales and Turtles",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/gabon-marine-protected-area-ocean-conservation,06-05-2017,Gabon’s announcement also restricts overfishing and may help with climate resilience.,"The central African nation of Gabon announced Monday the creation of Africa’s largest network of marine protected areas, home to a diverse array of threatened marine life, including the largest breeding populations of leatherback and olive ridley sea turtles and 20 species of dolphins and whales.

The network of 20 marine parks and aquatic reserves will protect 26 percent of Gabon’s territorial seas and extend across 20,500 square miles (53,000 square kilometers). In creating the protected areas, the Gabon government also set up what scientists call the most sustainable fisheries management plan for West Africa—an area long known for rampant overfishing and abuses by foreign fleets. Separate zones have been established for commercial and artisanal fishing fleets, in an effort to restore sustainable fishing.

“West Africa is an area which has incredibly rich oceans, but it is being bled dry by international fishing fleets,” says Callum Roberts, a marine conservation biologist at the University of York in Great Britain. “In the space of a few decades, the waters of West Africa have moved from being a cornucopia of marine life to something that is far reduced from that. Protection is urgently needed to rebalance fish resources.” The central African nation of Gabon announced Monday the creation of Africa’s largest network of marine protected areas, home to a diverse array of threatened marine life, including the largest breeding populations of leatherback and olive ridley sea turtles and 20 species of dolphins and whales.

That’s the only good news out of Hurricane Ida, which left a trail of wreckage all the way to the northeastern United States, where it unleashed a deluge that caused historic flooding and so far, killed more than 48 people in five eastern states.

Even after Ida was downgraded from hurricane status, it remained an intense, rain-laden storm as it traveled cross-country from the Gulf Coast. In New York City’s Central Park, it dropped three inches of rain in an hour—a record.

Now, scientists are arguing that the methane theory is unlikely, based on new satellite surveys released by Russian researchers that found dozens of new craters in Siberia.

The study, published on Tuesday in Geophysical Research Letters, focuses on “atmospheric rivers,” huge belts of water vapor that form over tropical and subtropical oceans, then ride the winds that encircle the planet, delivering sometimes copious amounts of rain and snow. One famous atmospheric river, called the Pineapple Express, is responsible for much of the water supply for the West Coast of the United States. 

Using data from NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission, launched into orbit in late 2018, a team of researchers found that atmospheric rivers were a major driver of precipitation, mostly snowfall, across West Antarctica in 2019, helping to replenish mass that the ice sheet is quickly losing. With warming seas expected to send bigger, longer-lasting atmospheric rivers to Antarctica’s shores in the future, the research points to an understudied and little-understood process that could help to slow the ice sheet’s meltdown—or accelerate it, depending on the timing of the storms.

For the Anishinaabe, hunting has never been a sport, and life is never taken lightly.

So when the big bull moose approached Tom Morriseau Borg, he felt a mix of gratitude, awe, and humility: The moose was offering itself, a gift of life and meat from the forest that Borg would share with family and friends. Borg, a traditional Anishinaabe trapper, grew up near Lake Nipigon in western Ontario in a home without electricity or running water. The Anishinaabe have fished, hunted, and trapped there for centuries, and after Borg shot the moose, he sprinkled tobacco on the animal and whispered some prayers of thanks, just as his grandfather had taught him.

But as he dressed the carcass—cutting it up to bring home—Borg’s gratitude gave way to revulsion. When he tried to extract the liver, which should have been firm and meaty, it deliquesced into a bloody sludge, sliding goopily through his fingers. Since that hunt, Borg has found similarly diseased livers in several animals. “I notice it in rabbits, beavers, and in partridges,” he said. “The favorite part of the rabbit for me was the rib cage, with the heart and the liver. But now we don’t eat that anymore.”

Borg suspects that the spraying of herbicides by timber companies is hurting the animals in Lake Nipigon’s watershed. “New shoots are the moose’s favorite food,” he said. “They thrive on that new growth.” Or they did until it was poisoned. “That’s the way it works. Herbicides flow into streams to beaver lodges—that’s why their innards are so messed up.

“When I see harm and disruption, it hurts a lot. And the changes I’ve seen in the bush over the last 15 years—I didn’t think changes could come that fast,” Borg said as he finished the story on a cool summer evening at his home in Nipigon. This story appears in the December 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.

For the Anishinaabe, hunting has never been a sport, and life is never taken lightly.

So when the big bull moose approached Tom Morriseau Borg, he felt a mix of gratitude, awe, and humility: The moose was offering itself, a gift of life and meat from the forest that Borg would share with family and friends. Borg, a traditional Anishinaabe trapper, grew up near Lake Nipigon in western Ontario in a home without electricity or running water. The Anishinaabe have fished, hunted, and trapped there for centuries, and after Borg shot the moose, he sprinkled tobacco on the animal and whispered some prayers of thanks, just as his grandfather had taught him.

Nuclear fusion powers stars. Could it one day electrify Earth?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/nuclear-fusion-powers-stars-could-it-one-day-electrify-earth,08-05-2022,The elusive power source can’t save us from the need to cut emissions now. But a $20-billion reactor approaching completion in southern France could pave the way for the future.,"For seven years, Bernard Bigot oversaw the construction of a building so ambitious and challenging, and of such significance to humanity, he sometimes thought of it as a cathedral.

Rising from a 445-acre plot in southern France, an hour north of Marseille, it’s a very strange edifice indeed. Not many buildings house cavernous vacuum chambers or require sub-millimeter precision during construction. Fewer still would include a 59-foot-tall magnet powerful enough to lift an aircraft carrier, or enough superconducting niobium-tin wire to circle the equator twice.

The project that Bigot oversaw, called ITER, for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, is arguably the biggest, most complex, and, at a cost of more than $20 billion, most expensive science experiment ever devised. The consortium of 35 countries financing ITER and building its components represent more than half of the world’s population and 85 percent of global GDP. The U.S., Russia, China, and the European Union are all members.

Some of ITER’s incoming components are so massive, France has had to widen or reinforce 64 miles’ worth of roads and bridges to get them to the construction site in Saint-Paul-lez-Durance. When the reactor is completed, no sooner than 2025—it’s about three quarters of the way there now—it will have taken 40 years of negotiations, design work, and construction to get there.

All of this in service of an audacious goal and a half-century old dream: To generate energy by harnessing nuclear fusion, the power source of the stars. Fusion, if it can ever be tamed, promises abundant power without smokestack fumes or planet-baking carbon emissions, without reactor meltdowns or long-lived radioactive waste—power on demand 24/7, with seawater as the ultimate source of fuel.

Covering our climate—where we keep setting records for the hottest year—is one of the most important things we can do. It’s especially crucial in an era when some people claim that there are no “facts” and basic science is loudly questioned without embarrassment.

At National Geographic we are proudly nonpartisan. But there are a few matters on which we do take sides:"
"Once derided, ways of adapting to climate change are gaining steam",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/communities-adapt-to-changing-climate-after-fires-floods-storms,01-09-2019,Recognition is spreading that communities need to build resilience to climatic and coastal threats even as the world seeks ways to curb emissions driving global warming.,"This article was created in partnership with the National Geographic Society.

From chronically flooded Midwestern towns to fire-charred California suburbs, from Bangladesh’s sodden delta to low island nations facing rising seas, a long-underplayed strategy for cutting risks related to human-driven climate change is coming to the fore—adaptation.

Through 30 years of efforts to limit global warming, the dominant goal was cutting emissions of heat-trapping gases, most importantly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Efforts to adapt communities or agriculture to warming and the related rise in seas and other impacts were often seen as a copout.

The spotty nature of adaptation efforts so far can be seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael—where one reinforced, raised home famously survived, nearly alone, along Mexico Beach, Florida, after the strongest Panhandle hurricane in at least 155 years. In the Camp Fire that devastated Paradise, California, and killed 85 people, a sprinkling of houses built and maintained to withstand embers survived, but—again—were the rare exception.

Once-rare Arctic lightning is now more frequent—and may reshape the region,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/once-rare-arctic-lighting-is-now-more-frequent-and-may-reshape-the-region,04-09-2021,Recent studies suggest lightning in the far North could double by 2100 and that the increase may already be underway.,"Lightning in the Arctic used to be so vanishingly rare that people could go their whole lives without seeing a flash. But as the region warms rapidly, it may become more common—with effects that could reach outside the Arctic.

One recent study projects that the occurrence of lightning in the Arctic could double by the end of the century. Another study suggests that the number of Arctic flashes may have tripled within the last decade alone—though some researchers question that result.

Increased lightning is a worrying sign of today’s rapidly accelerating climate change, scientists say, but they’re also concerned for the future: More lightning could set off a cascade of ecological shifts that could release huge Arctic reserves of carbon into the atmosphere, accelerating warming further.

Their bones were what first inspired me to start asking questions about the past and, many years later, set me on a path of professionally puzzling over prehistory. But I can’t give all the credit to fantastic saurians.

Mammals have always been part of my ancient education, even when they were shadows of the Cenozoic that I overlooked in favor of Apatosaurus and company. Plastic effigies of Uintatherium were stashed inside plastic bags of scaly monsters I got from the supermarket toy aisle, elephants trussed up as shaggy mammoths tromped through the movies I’d stay up late to watch, and no museum visit was complete without stopping to gaze at the bizarre bones of the giant ground sloths. I feel sorry that I didn’t fully appreciate them earlier. They’re both strange and familiar – animals that are perhaps easier to envision, but difficult to truly understand.

Not that mammals were restricted to the time after the non-avian dinosaurs were ushered off the evolutionary stage. The first mammals evolved over 220 million years ago, back when crocodile cousins were in the limelight and dinosaurs were marginal players. And while mammals stayed small as dinosaurs rose to dominance, the beasts nevertheless took on an array of ecological roles that included swimmers, burrowers, gliders, and more. The catastrophic finale of the Cretaceous is what let the surviving mammals go from understudies to leads, and many of them were as spectacular as any dinosaur. I like dinosaurs. A lot.

One of the most resilient trees on Earth is dying in droves,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/forest-bald-cypress-climate-change-sea-level-rise,08-15-2023,North America’s ancient bald cypress forests have told scientists about history’s legendary droughts and wet periods. Now they’re warning us about the future.,"On a brisk December day, David Stahle stands atop a ladder leaning against a bald cypress tree as wide as he is tall. Like a woodsy Doctor Who dropped into this southern swamp with a sonic screwdriver, Stahle begins slowly boring through time.

The first inch takes him back to before the First World War, the second to the birth of the United States. Within five inches, Stahle, a dendrochronologist at the University of Arkansas, has reached Columbus’s voyage to the New World. By the time he’s finished extracting the pencil-thin core, Stahle has enough rings to estimate that the gnarled cypress sprang from its sodden bed as the first Crusaders were marching toward Jerusalem about a thousand years ago. But it’s the half-inch sliver close to the bark, from around 1900 to 1935, that Stahle points out.

By the end of that period, roughly 90 percent of the ancient bald cypresses in the U.S. had been cut, Stahle says. “There’s less than a tenth of one percent of the original bottomland cypress swamp left” in the country. “That’s why this place is something special.” On a brisk December day, David Stahle stands atop a ladder leaning against a bald cypress tree as wide as he is tall.

Washington’s Mount Rainier boasts the largest collection of glaciers on a single peak in the contiguous United States. But those glaciers have lost approximately 18 percent of their volume since 1970. The most substantial thinning is occurring on south-facing glaciers and at elevations below 6,562 feet (2,000 meters). During extreme weather this could set the stage for massive floods and debris flows in the park and surrounding areas. This story appears in the May 2019 issue of National Geographic magazine.

One overlooked way to fight climate change? Dispose of old CFCs.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/disposing-old-cfcs-refrigerants-reduces-climate-change-greenhouse-gases-cheaply,04-29-2019,"The banned refrigerants not only degrade ozone, they act as greenhouse gases. New models are making it easier to get rid of old stocks.","At City Waste Recycling in Accra, Ghana, owners Jürgen Meniel and Vivian Ahiayibor mostly focus on plastics and metals, but they also reclaim refrigerants from old equipment. Several years ago, they learned of a large cache of unused canisters of a refrigerant called CFC-12. The containers looked like small propane tanks, but the gas inside was illegal.

Outlawed thirty years ago by the Montreal Protocol because of their harmful effects on the stratospheric ozone layer, CFCs have also been found to have a second, destructive effect on the climate.

A single molecule of CFC-12 can hold nearly 11,000 times the heat of carbon dioxide, making it an extraordinarily potent greenhouse gas. The small, dark shed where the refrigerant cache was gathering dust held nearly 30,000 pounds of CFCs. If released into the atmosphere, those CFCs would hold the same heat as the carbon dioxide emissions from burning 16 million gallons of gasoline.

"Our oceans are under attack by climate change, overfishing",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/ocean,03-21-2019,The vast bodies of water surrounding the continents are critical to life on Earth. But overfishing and global warming threaten to leave oceans barren.,"The ocean is a continuous body of salt water that covers more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface. Ocean currents govern the world's weather and churn a kaleidoscope of life. Humans depend on these teeming waters for comfort and survival, but global warming and overfishing threaten Earth's largest habitat.

Geographers divide the ocean into five major basins: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Southern. Smaller ocean regions such as the Mediterranean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Bay of Bengal are called seas, gulfs, and bays. Inland bodies of saltwater such as the Caspian Sea and the Great Salt Lake are distinct from the world's oceans.

The oceans hold about 321 million cubic miles (1.34 billion cubic kilometers) of water, which is roughly 97 percent of Earth's water supply. Seawater's weight is about 3.5 percent dissolved salt; oceans are also rich in chlorine, magnesium, and calcium. The oceans absorb the sun's heat, transferring it to the atmosphere and distributing it around the world. This conveyor belt of heat drives global weather patterns and helps regulate temperatures on land, acting as a heater in the winter and an air conditioner in the summer.

Many are dependent on subsistence farming that requires long hours of hard outdoor labor.

""That makes them very vulnerable to these climatic changes,” said MIT professor of environmental engineering Elfatih Eltahir, one of the co-authors.

The study shows that on the current business-as-usual trajectory of carbon emissions these deadly heat waves could hit the region within a few decades with potentially devastating impacts on the fertile Indus and Ganges River Basins that produce much of the region's food supply."
Past Disasters Reveal Terrifying Future of Climate Change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/climate-change-global-warming-history-health,03-05-2017,"Plagues, famines, heat waves—sudden changes in climate have been deadly for humans.","Human activity is altering our climate.

Surprisingly, the answers to what our future holds with climate change may lie in the past, especially how it will affect our health. This is the path that Australian public health expert Anthony McMichael sought to pursue in Climate Change and the Health of Nations: Famines, Fevers, and the Fate of Populations.

McMichael died unexpectedly in 2014, before he could finish his magisterial study, which was completed by Alistair Woodward, a former student and noted epidemiologist. When National Geographic caught up with Woodward by phone at his home in New Zealand, he explained how human-caused global warming differs from the climate change that naturally occurred in the past; why Mozart may have been a victim of El Niño; and how catastrophic famines and infectious diseases could occur again if we don’t act.

An American president has just been elected who is skeptical about climate change, as are many in his cabinet. How can looking in the rearview mirror of history change their minds?

It seems to me that the arguments put forward by the people who don’t want to take action on climate change fall into several categories. One is to say, no such thing exists. Possibly President Trump is in that category. I’m not sure whether he’s given it enough thought to form a view. Another argument is, perhaps the world is warming, but it’s not humans. Plenty of climate scientists have responded to that and the evidence is overwhelming that, by and large, it’s human activity that has caused the recent changes in the world’s climate.

But the charismatic birds weren’t always flightless aquatic acrobats: Evolving from flying to swimming demanded an almost entirely new set of skills, body shapes, and functions.

Permian Period,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/permian,01-24-2017,Learn about the time period took place between 299 to 251 million years ago.,"The Permian period, which ended in the largest mass extinction the Earth has ever known, began about 299 million years ago. The emerging supercontinent of Pangaea presented severe extremes of climate and environment due to its vast size. The south was cold and arid, with much of the region frozen under ice caps. Northern areas suffered increasingly from intense heat and great seasonal fluctuations between wet and dry conditions. The lush swamp forests of the Carboniferous were gradually replaced by conifers, seed ferns, and other drought-resistant plants.

Early reptiles were well placed to capitalize on the new environment. Shielded by their thicker, moisture-retaining skins, they moved in where amphibians had previously held sway. Over time, they became ideally suited to the desert-type habitats in which they thrive today.

Animal Development

Being cold-blooded, reptiles had to find ways to deal with big daily variations in temperature, from below freezing at night to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) during the day. Some of the primitive pelycosaurs, which measured up to ten feet (three meters) long, had sail-like structures on their backs that are thought to have acted as heat exchangers, catching the sun in the morning to help warm the sluggish creatures.

You might see a visible reduction in water level, or perhaps new development in the area—maybe the lake has completely dried and is no longer there at all. What makes photo comparisons striking are the differences between the two images that are now made so apparent. (See creepy before and after photos of abandoned American resort towns.)

But what if you can make the same impact with one single photo?

In developed countries, the disease is commonly caused by diabetes and high blood pressure. However, other factors seem to be driving the kidney disease that researchers are seeing in farmers in Nicaragua and rural India.

Although there is still uncertainty about what causes CKDnT, heat stress and recurrent dehydration are likely factors.

Functioning kidneys keep the body healthy by filtering waste out of the blood. Kidney disease can be fatal in advanced stages, and people with advanced CKDnT must receive dialysis every week to stay alive. But this treatment involves special machines that artificially filter a person’s blood, and for people in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, these treatments are often too expensive or can only be found at facilities that are too far away. In rural Central America and India, researchers are witnessing the spread of chronic kidney disease (CKD)—the gradual loss of kidney function.

In developed countries, the disease is commonly caused by diabetes and high blood pressure. However, other factors seem to be driving the kidney disease that researchers are seeing in farmers in Nicaragua and rural India. Because of this, researchers refer to the condition in these areas as chronic kidney disease of non-traditional causes, or CKDnT.

The environmental treatise is an emotionally charged, at times scathing look at how humankind has forsaken its stewardship of the earth in favor of a “throwaway culture.” Yet again, Pope Francis has made the most of his bully pulpit.

The pontiff’s forceful language suggests he intends to launch an urgent campaign to press world leaders to attack global warming, possibly including an address to a U.S. Congress that is largely under the sway of climate change skeptics. His immense popularity, the vast goodwill he has inspired and his penchant for bracingly simple, straightforward statements about his beliefs will make him a powerful voice.

The timing of the encyclical is significant.
Cardinal Peter Turkson, Adviser to the pope on climate issues

That Francis would weigh in with such unsparing terminology should surprise no one. In a speech earlier this year widely viewed as a preview of the encyclical, Cardinal Peter Turkson made it abundantly clear that Francis had every intention of influencing global debate over the environment. “The timing of the encyclical is significant,” said Turkson, the president of the Pontifical Council of Justice and Peace, which has served as the Vatican’s unofficial in-house think tank on environmental issues. He noted this year’s critical environmental summits, including the U.N. conference in Paris that seeks to craft a binding agreement.

Prediction of Rapid Sea Level Rise Won’t Change Global Climate Talks,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/150721-james-hansen-sea-level-rise-climate-change-global-warming-science,07-21-2015,A new study predicting 10 feet of sea level rise by the century’s end isn’t supported by the mainstream scientific community.,"A bombshell climate study published this week warns that sea levels may rise a catastrophic 10 feet (3 meters) by the end of this century, rather than the currently predicted 3 feet (.9 meters). But mainstream climate scientists say the report appears speculative and is not in sync with the leading understanding of melting sea ice.

As a result, the study is unlikely to change leading scientific consensus or affect the current negotiations on a comprehensive global agreement on climate change.

The new study, led by former NASA climate scientist James Hansen (now at Columbia University) is set to be published in the peer-reviewed journal Atmospheric Physics and Chemistry. Hansen and 16 colleagues argue in the paper that increasing melting of the ice sheets over Greenland and Antarctica will lead to a shutdown of the ocean’s currents. That would lead to warm waters trapped under Antarctica, which would increase the melting of ice there (if all the continent’s ice melted, it would raise sea level by around 200 feet).

It's 62 degrees Fahrenheit.

We were standing in front of the Egg Rock Hilton, as researchers affectionately call a small wooden shack that’s the only sign of human presence—other than an outhouse and some bird blinds—on Eastern Egg Rock, a tiny island in Muscongus Bay.Project Puffin is a decades-long initiative to reestablish seabird populations—puffins but also guillemots, terns, and petrels on Eastern Egg Rock and two other rocky islands in the Gulf—Matinicus Rock and Seal Island. Puffins had been gone from these islands since the late 1800s, targeted by hunters and egg collectors. The restoration effort began in the early 1970s with the transfer of a few chicks from Newfoundland to Eastern Egg Rock. Today, the seven-acre island is home to roughly 180 breeding pairs.

    I visited Eastern Egg Rock with Lyons and photographer Brian Skerry this August. I was excited to see the charismatic little birds with the colorful beaks and clown faces. (Puffins are alcids, a family that includes the now extinct great auk). Eastern Egg Rock, Maine — “We know that things are changing in the Gulf of Maine because the puffins are telling us,” said Don Lyons, the director of conservation science for the National Audubon Society’s Seabird Institute and the head of the society’s Project Puffin. We were standing in front of the Egg Rock Hilton, as researchers affectionately call a small wooden shack that’s the only sign of human presence—other than an outhouse and some bird blinds—on Eastern Egg Rock, a tiny island in Muscongus Bay.Project Puffin is a decades-long initiative to reestablish seabird populations—puffins but also guillemots, terns, and petrels on Eastern Egg Rock and two other rocky islands in the Gulf—Matinicus Rock and Seal Island. Puffins had been gone from these islands since the late 1800s, targeted by hunters and egg collectors. The restoration effort began in the early 1970s with the transfer of a few chicks from Newfoundland to Eastern Egg Rock. Today, the seven-acre island is home to roughly 180 breeding pairs.

In 2011, he was appointed as an adviser to Peru's Ministry of the Environment. In this role, Ráez-Luna was involved in organizing the 20th Conference of the Parties (COP20) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change-the world's most important climate meeting; Peru is hosting the COP20 in December.

But in July, Ráez-Luna resigned over the administration's support of a law that, to the horror of environmental groups around the world, rolled back many green policies established in Peru during the past decade. The Ministry of the Environment, which was created in 2008, lost its authority to establish nature reserves protected from mining and oil development. On September 20, protesters marched on the environment ministry's headquarters in Lima, demanding green reforms before the UN Climate Summit in New York City.

National Geographic interviewed Ráez-Luna in Manú National Park, one of the largest remaining tracts of unlogged rain forest, where he is ""recharging his batteries"" in nature after his stint in politics.

The United States, most experts believe, must play a key role in any meaningful global agreement on the issue. But the U.S. has dragged its feet on promoting a global deal for years, as Republicans—and some Democrats—argued that it could cripple the nation's economy.

One idea for reducing global emissions that's sure to surface at this week's summit: a carbon tax. The proposal has no chance of passing in the U.S. Congress. But it is getting support from an unlikely source: American conservatives. A small cadre of influential conservatives, among them former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and supply-side-economics guru Arthur Laffer, favor a carbon tax.

Quiz: How Green Is Air Travel?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/air-travel-aviation-emissions-quiz,06-27-2017,What you don’t know about the aviation industry’s growth—and advances— just might surprise you.,"Air travel is big, big business. With 3.8 billion passengers a year and 9.9 million people employed, aviation adds 3.5 percent to the global economy. But what about the toll it takes on the environment?

Engineers, designers, and scientists are already working on ways to make air travel more green—and now the aviation industry has an even greater incentive. The push is 2016’s landmark international agreement on aviation emissions, which eventually will make offsetting or reducing carbon emissions mandatory for countries with major aviation industries.

So cue the design modifications, new technologies, better fuel alternatives, and other developments. Collectively they work to make flight more fuel efficient—and less fuel burned correlates with fewer greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change. Air travel is big, big business.

Rising Seas Threaten These Pacific Islands but Not Their Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/rising-seas-threaten-kiribati-pacific-islands,10-01-2015,Kiribati islanders draw on centuries of voyaging tradition and the power of cultural pride to confront the challenges coming their way.,"This story appears in the November 2015 issue of National Geographic magazine.

It was the time called itingaaro, the dawn twilight, when the island was just waking up and the roosters were vying to out-crow each other and the angel terns were twittering their love talk in the breadfruit trees. People drifted sleepily into the lagoon to wash, splashing water on their faces, then tightening their sarongs and diving under.

The tide was full and taut like the skin of a pregnant woman. Beyond the lagoon the ocean stretched to the horizon. Marawa, karawa, tarawa—sea, sky, land. These are the ancient trinity of the people of Kiribati (kee-ree-bahss), the I-Kiribati. But the trinity is tilting out of balance. Mother Ocean isn’t the heart of providence the people have always known. She is beginning to show a different face, a menacing one of encroaching tides and battering waves.

I-Kiribati now live with the reality of marawa rising. This is the time of bibitakin kanoan boong—“change in weather over many days”—the Kiribati phrase for climate change. The people live with the fear and uncertainty of those words.

How can they not feel afraid when the world keeps telling them that low-lying island countries like theirs will soon be underwater? Their own leaders have said that Kiribati—33 coral islands in an expanse of the central Pacific larger than India—is “among the most vulnerable of the vulnerable.” They have predicted that Tarawa atoll, the nation’s capital, will become uninhabitable within a generation.

But many I-Kiribati refuse to think of their homeland as a “disappearing island nation,” its fate already out of their hands. They do not think of themselves as “sinking islanders,” rather as descendants of voyagers, inheritors of a proud tradition of endurance and survival.

Rome wasn’t built for today’s climate. Is there time to save it?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/rome-climate-change-flooding-extreme-rains-devastation,06-13-2023,The question isn’t if a devastating flood will happen—but when. A newly created Office for the Climate is scrambling for a solution.,"Rome wasn’t built in a day, but a large portion of it can be devastated in a few hours when an extreme weather event hits, according to experts studying the city’s vulnerability. Rising temperatures are making severe storms more frequent globally, but what makes Rome a ticking climate time bomb is a combination of outdated infrastructures and decades of planning policy decisions that largely ignored the unfolding crisis.

While the climate is changing, the Eternal City is not.

Since 2008, extreme rainfalls have increased in frequency and intensity, and roughly 20 of the most extreme events recorded between 2010 and 2020 caused significant floods in the urban area, according to the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change. Even moderate rainfall regularly turns some streets of the city, which is spread out on the hills, into paved rivers flowing toward the low areas, inundating subway stops and underpasses.

Severe heat waves are the flip side of the climate coin. In the last two decades, average temperatures in Rome have risen by 3.6 degrees Celsius compared to the period between 1971 and 2000, and the number of heat-related deaths among adults aged 50 and over has increased by 22 percent. Mortality rates among the elderly spike dramatically during the summer near the ever-expanding urban heat islands. Rome’s climate is an all-too-common pendulum swinging between drought and flood, but the city doesn’t have an adaptation plan yet and its complex, centuries-old structure is particularly exposed to climatic variations.

“Climate change is exacerbating pre-existing problems,” says Andrea Filpa, an architect and urban planner at the University Roma Tre who co-authored the first vulnerability map of Rome.

Same force behind Texas deep freeze could drive prolonged heat waves,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/same-mechanism-behind-southern-cold-spell-could-drive-prolonged-heat-waves,02-18-2021,Long-lasting heat waves can be deadly. A new study suggests a warming Arctic could drive more of them in the future.,"The jury is still out on whether climate change is playing a role in the brutal cold, snow, and ice that have wreaked havoc across Texas this week, cutting power to millions of Texans, bursting pipes, and contaminating water supplies. But the same climate connection scientists are debating—Arctic warming causing the jet stream to meander further south—might also cause the southern United States to experience more persistent heat waves in the future.

That’s according to research published last month in Geophysical Research Letters that addresses the poorly studied question of whether enhanced Arctic warming, or “Arctic amplification,” will lead to longer lasting hot weather spells at lower latitudes. Using a new approach of tracking weather systems to see how quickly they move, the researchers identified a link between slower-moving summer weather patterns and a smaller temperature difference between the equator and the Arctic, caused by the latter warming more rapidly.

If that trend continues, heat waves might become significantly more persistent over the next 70 years or so, particularly in regions like the southern U.S. Given that future heat waves are also expected to be hotter, the research points to a potential double atmospheric whammy that could strain societies’ ability to cope: hotter weather that sticks around longer.

But by the middle of the century most of it will in fact vanish, thanks to our burning of fossil fuels. The North Pole and most of the ocean around it will be free of sea ice in summer for the first time in thousands of years.

Will we ever bring the ice back?

That’s the question a team of researchers from Columbia University pondered in a presentation last week at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. It’s not as academic as it sounds. Most climate models suggest that our efforts to limit carbon dioxide emissions—starting with the steps agreed to in Paris on December 12—will not be enough to keep Earth from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius. To prevent even worse impacts than the loss of Arctic ice, by late in this century we’ll have to not only shut down emissions, but find a way to clean up massive amounts of carbon dioxide that we’ve already put in the atmosphere.

In the new report, NOAA's team focused on an ever changing network of thousands of temperature-monitoring stations on land and on ships and buoys at sea around the world. The scientists replotted average annual surface temperatures since 1880 while accounting for changes and quirks in the readings, particularly anomalies from ocean ships and buoys.

Matienzo was an Argentine research base on a small island 30 miles off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. It was surrounded by a vast plain of white—a slab of glacial ice, 700 feet (215 meters) thick, that floated on the ocean. That floating slab, called Larsen A Ice Shelf, covered an area of water the size of San Francisco Bay. It had existed for a thousand years or more. But this hot summer it looked strange. The men had to go onto the ice shelf to collect snow for drinking water, and it made them uneasy.

The ice shelf was crisscrossed with narrow cracks—which the men nervously jumped over—and dotted with deep blue melt ponds. It was there, protruding from a melt pond, that they found the sled. It must have been discarded by a British expedition that passed through decades before.

They buffer shorelines from the effects of hurricanes. An estimated 500 million people earn their livelihoods from the fishing stocks and tourism opportunities reefs provide. The tiny animals that give rise to reefs are even offering hope for new drugs to treat cancer and other diseases.

Despite their importance, warming waters, pollution, ocean acidification, overfishing, and physical destruction are killing coral reefs around the world. Schemes to save those reefs are as creative as they are varied; most recently, scientists released data showing that marine protected areas can help save reefs if they are placed in just the right spots. Genetics is also becoming a larger area of coral research, giving scientists hope they might one day restore reefs with more heat tolerant coral.

Rising seas is one of those climate change effects. Average sea levels have swelled over 8 inches (about 23 cm) since 1880, with about three of those inches gained in the last 25 years. Every year, the sea rises another .13 inches (3.2 mm.) Research published in February 2022 shows that sea level rise is accelerating and projected to rise by a foot by 2050.

That translates into as much sea level rise in the next 30 years as occurred over the last century, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Rick Spinrad, the NOAA administrator, called the findings “historic,” and warned that the projected rise will occur even if carbon emissions are drastically cut.  As humans continue to pour greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, oceans have tempered the effect.

According to a new study published this week in Geophysical Research Letters, those volcanoes are surprisingly sensitive to the tides—and they just might have something to do with ice ages as well.

Maya Tolstoy, a marine geophysicist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, examined seismic records of ten seafloor eruptions. She found the eruptions tended to occur near “neap” tide, every two weeks, when the amount of seawater over the volcanoes is slightly lower than at other times. The reduced weight on the volcanoes apparently encourages small earthquakes, which can be associated with eruptions. (See “Pictures: Giant Undersea Volcano Revealed.”)

What’s more, all ten eruptions occurred during the first six months of the year, when Earth is moving farther away from the sun on its very slightly elliptical orbit. That’s when the sun’s tidal pull on Earth’s solid crust is diminishing in a way that also favors eruptions. Earth’s seafloor is born in fiery eruptions along volcanic mid-ocean ridges.

Over the course of his career, Beltrá has discovered a surprisingly effective way to get his message across: abstract, aerial images that, for him, have more impact than traditional storytelling methods. “These photographs are painterly, abstract, beautiful, and also scary, depending on what they’re depicting,” he says. “It helps to have a certain separation from these big issues—deforestation, global warming, climate change, etc. I find that being up and a bit away helps you to understand the problem.” Visually illustrating climate change and global environmental shifts is no easy task. But for photographer Daniel Beltrá, documenting humanity’s effect on our planet has been a lifelong passion. To date he’s photographed the polar regions, the Amazon, Iceland, Greenland, and even the BP oil spill.

Meltwater flows across the top of the Greenland ice sheet southeast of Ilulissat, which has been sullied by cryoconite, or ash and soot. The presence of cryoconite deposited on top of the ice sheet triples the melt rate, says Beltrá. August 2014.

The Pacific region has experienced devastating cyclones, storm surges, coral bleaching, and irregular rainfall patterns. Sea level rise threatens low-lying islands, where salt water infiltrates drinking water wells and kills staple food crops, as well as damaging property.

Photographer Vlad Sokhin has been documenting environmental changes in Pacific communities since 2013. Sokhin focuses on indigenous communities who are adapting to challenges created primarily by carbon emissions from developed countries, he says.

Late last year, the Russian energy giant Novatek finished building the northernmost industrial facility on the globe: Yamal LNG, a $27-billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant sitting at 71.2 degrees north at Sabetta, on the bank of the Ob River. The facility and its new port cling to the eastern shore of the gas-rich Yamal Peninsula, which sticks up like a frostbitten thumb into the Kara Sea—that is, in the middle of frozen nowhere.

The plant was finished a year ahead of schedule, in no small part because the Russian government helped build a massive port for LNG tankers, an airport, and a powerplant, not to mention using its fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers to keep the channel clear for ships coming in with construction material.

See What Climate Change Means for the World’s Poor,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/151201-datapoints-climate-change-poverty-agriculture,12-01-2015,The most damaging effects of the changing climate will hit stomachs as well as wallets.,"Climate change has been linked to increased frequency and intensity of destructive weather events, such as floods and hurricanes. But the effects of a warming planet on crops may pose an even greater danger, especially for the world’s poor, according to the World Bank.

“Agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors in many poor countries,” says a report from the institution. “Unfortunately, it is also one of the most sensitive to climate change given its dependence on weather conditions, both directly and through climate-dependent stressors (pests, epidemics, and sea level rise).”

The report focuses on developing economies and doesn’t include North America, Australia, or a handful of other areas. It sets up two scenarios to project the effects of climate change. The “prosperity scenario” is optimistic: It predicts strong economic growth, fewer people living in poverty, and improvements in basic services. The “poverty scenario” isn’t as hopeful: It predicts the number of impoverished people will grow from the current 702 million to around 900 million by 2030 without factoring in climate change. When climate change is part of the equation, more than a billion people will be in poverty. Most of that additional 100 million, the report says, will become poor due to rising food prices.

The critical ability of trees to absorb carbon dioxide humans place in the atmosphere has inspired many people to reforest swaths of protected lands and to think differently about a future of forest conservation.

It is this passion to protect the world’s forests that inspired the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to travel to parts of Africa—including Botswana, Angola, and Malawi—where the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy (QCC) is introducing new forest conservation initiatives.

Today, the Duke of Sussex dedicated Liwonde National Park and adjoining Mangochi Forest in Malawi to the QCC. And on Saturday, September 28, Buckingham Palace announced on the Royal Family Instagram that Luengue-Luiana National Park in Angola was also being added to the QCC. The conservation of that area will protect an important elephant migration corridor.

In Huamantanga, an Andes mountain village a couple hours’ drive from the capital city Lima, people still use a 1,400-year-old technique to capture rainfall in shallow canals made of rock called amunas and route the water to sandy, rocky places where it will soak into the ground.

Because water moves more slowly below ground than on the surface, the captured rainfall emerges some time later from underground springs, effectively shifting water availability into the dry season.

Now, for the first time, researchers have measured and modeled how restoring and using additional amunas—which exist in different parts of the Andes highlands, although many have been abandoned—could help Lima, the second largest desert city in the world. With a population pushing 10 million, Lima has dams and reservoirs to help it through the dry season, but the city still falls short: The average dry season deficit is 43 million cubic meters of water. Lima’s total annual demand is 848 million cubic meters.

When used as taxis, scientists say, the type of robotic vehicles that Google and Uber are building could also cut greenhouse gas emissions—a lot.

An autonomous or self-driving electric cab in 2030 could emit up to 94 percent fewer emissions per mile than a conventional gasoline car of today, and it could be far cheaper than taxis with drivers, says a study Monday by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Almost half the savings occur, because the taxi is “right-sized” for each trip.

""Most trips in the U.S. are taken singly, meaning one- or two-seat cars would satisfy most trips,"" author Jeffery Greenblatt says in announcing the findings. Small taxis use less energy and emit fewer greenhouse gases than larger ones that carry multiple passengers or those with luggage.

It’s not that the warning signs of climate change haven’t been apparent for decades. In the 1950s, data on human-produced carbon dioxide (CO2) and climate modeling indicated that the planet was warming, and, if left unchecked, would cause irrevocable harm to life on the planet.

Engabreen Glacier, July 17, 2006 Photograph by Orsolya Haarberg

It is difficult to visualize how climate change is affecting our environment, especially in the Arctic sea-ice regions, because melting still happens slowly with large yearly fluctuations. However, small changes add up to huge alterations over time. This is particularly dramatic on land, and in the case of the glaciers. Glaciers are relatively small compared to ice caps and are therefore good indicators of climate change. The photograph above is of the Norwegian Engabreen Glacier in 2006. When I returned six years later in 2012, there was no ice. From the time I made this first image, the ice had retreated more than 150 meters. —Orsolya Haarberg This month, as National Geographic’s climate change issueNational Geographic’s climate change issue hits the stands, we asked seven photographers to share their most poignant images that reflect climate change.

A new study in Nature Communications Biology by Taylor and Avery Paxton, a marine ecologist who divides her time between NOAA and the Duke University Marine Laboratory, shows artificial deepwater reefs off the coast of North Carolina increased the number of tropical and subtropical fishes at the northern edge of their ranges. These findings have important implications for fishes in warming waters. As ocean temperatures rise, artificial reefs may facilitate the movement of these species towards the poles, where they may be able to find habitat that is more suitable in the future.

That test, and others, tell the engineers at the university’s Extreme Events Institute how to design and build structures that will withstand the 157 mile-per-hour winds that come with a top-rated Category 5 storm.

But now, climate change threatens to make these storms worse, and new science makes the case for a Category 6 that begins when winds exceed 192 miles per hour. Five different storms that all formed in the past nine years would fit this designation, and to brace for more, scientists are planning to build a new hurricane lab to test these so-called Cat 6 hurricanes.  When Florida International University turns on the “Wall of Wind” inside its airplane hangar turned engineering lab, 12 enormous fans recreate the strength of a major hurricane.

The Batagiaka crater in eastern Siberia, already the largest of its kind, has been growing wider. The most recent measurements, published in February of this year, estimate the crater to be 0.6 miles long and 282 feet deep. These numbers are expected to continue gradually increasing.

The local Yukatian people approach the area with caution. They report hearing ominous noises, leading some to call it a portal to the underworld.

Thousands of miles away in Siberia, hot, dry weather has helped fuel widespread forest fires that are releasing giant plumes of smoke and hundreds of millions of tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Residents of the region, many of them farmers, have been fighting the unprecedented fires themselves, even as they attempt to harvest what they can before wildfire consumes their crops.

Siberia may be better known for its frigid winters, but it’s no stranger to summer wildfires. And for the past few summers, those fires have been exceptional, particularly in the Sakha Republic, a region of far northeastern Russia nearly double the size of Alaska. In 2020, Sakhan wildfires were more intense, and released more carbon between June and August, than at any other point in satellite records going back to 2003.

Sinking land and rising seas: the dual crises facing coastal communities,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/sinking-land-rising-seas-dual-crises-facing-coastal-communities,03-08-2021,A double whammy of climate change and human-caused land subsidence means global coastal residents are experiencing extreme sea-level rise.,"The world’s coastal residents are experiencing more extreme sea level rise than is widely appreciated because they are concentrated in places where the land is sinking rapidly, a study published Monday in Nature Climate Change has found.

Sea levels are rising globally as Earth’s ice sheets melt and as warming sea water expands. But on a local scale, subsidence, or sinking land, can dramatically aggravate the problem. Cities like New Orleans and Jakarta are experiencing very rapid sea level rise relative to their coastlines—the land itself is sinking as the water is rising.

Now, an international team of researchers has demonstrated that this one-two punch is more than a local problem. Sinking land makes coastal residents around the world disproportionately vulnerable to rising seas: The typical coastal inhabitant is experiencing a sea level rise rate three to four times higher than the global average.

Zimov, like his father, Sergey Zimov, has spent years running a research station that tracks climate change in the rapidly warming Russian Far East. So when students probed the ground and took soil samples amid the mossy hummocks and larch forests near his home, 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, Nikita Zimov suspected something wasn't right.

Sergey Zimov measures permafrost levels with his granddaughters near the Northeast Science Station which he founded in Cherskiy, Russia, along the Kolyma River. About an hour away is Zimov's large-scale scientific experiment Pleistocene Park, which he runs with his son, Nikita Zimov. The two believe that by recreating the ecosystem of the Pleistocene era, which was dominated by grasslands and large mammals, they can slow permafrost thaw.

Some Species Will Actually Thrive on a Warming Planet,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/warming-planet-which-species-will-thrive,11-01-2015,But others are likely to face increasing threats to their survival. Here’s a guide to some of the winners and losers.,"This story appears in the November 2015 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Climates change. That’s a fact of nature. But Earth’s climate today is changing so dramatically that it’s transforming land and sea, affecting all forms of life.

“There will always be a minority that manage to thrive in relatively sudden new conditions,” says Thomas Lovejoy, a George Mason University conservation biologist and a National Geographic fellow. “But the vast majority will be terribly battered,” if not crushed.

Higher temperatures caused by greenhouse gases are just the beginning of this ride. Next come extreme weather (including extensive drought), shifting breeding and migration seasons, and changing food availability, new disease patterns, rapid ice melt, and rising seas. Each change begets a host of others: Effects run far and wide.

Change can be good for some—a longer spring with more food, a comfortable niche to call home, a stressful migration avoided. But as the layers build and warming continues, winners may hit new limits and lose their edge.

This isn’t the stuff of the future. The effects of an altered climate are evident now. This story appears in the November 2015 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Tire tracks stretched across the flat lake bed to the horizon. We followed them in a Suzuki 4x4, looking for clues about what’s happened to Poopó, once Bolivia’s second largest lake, which has vanished into the thin air of the Andean highlands.

We were driving on the lake bottom, yet we were more than 12,000 feet above sea level. The spring air was lip-chapping dry. Many of the fishing villages that have relied on Lake Poopó for thousands of years have emptied too, and we drove past clusters of abandoned adobe homes. Dust devils danced around them, spinning in warm winds. In the distance we spotted several small aluminum boats that seemed to be floating on water. As we drove closer, the mirage receded, and we found the boats sitting abandoned in the silt. I stepped out of the vehicle. My shoes cracked the salty crust that had formed jagged lumps, like ice cream in a freezer that has melted and recrystallized.

My guide, Ramiro Pillco Zolá, crunched across the salt pan to reach one of the dilapidated, half-buried boats. Boyhood memories of paddling across the lake flooded back to him from long before he left his village of San Pedro de Condo to study hydrology and eventually earn a Ph.D. in hydrology and climate change at Lund University in Sweden. “We’re not talking about a small thing,” Pillco Zolá told me. “Three decades ago this lake covered 3,000 square kilometers. It’s going to be hard to recover.”

Water that once spread across an expanse about the size of Rhode Island was gone. A pair of black rubber boots lay discarded near the boat. A fish skull bleached brilliant white flashed under the blinding sun. The wind suddenly stopped, cloaking the post-apocalyptic scene in silence. If water is life, this was the absence of both.

A study published Wednesday in Nature shows that mega-melts like that one, which are being amplified by climate change, aren’t just causing Greenland to shed billions of tons of ice. They’re causing the remaining ice to become denser.

“Ice slabs”—solid planks of ice that can span hundreds of square miles and grow to be 50 feet thick—are spreading across the porous, air pocket-filled surface of the Greenland ice sheet as it melts and refreezes more often. From 2001 to 2014, the slabs expanded in area by about 25,000 square miles, forming an impermeable barrier the size of West Virginia that prevents meltwater from trickling down through the ice. Instead, the meltwater becomes runoff that flows overland, eventually making its way out to sea.

As the ice slabs continue to spread, the study’s authors predict more and more of Greenland’s surface will become a “runoff zone,” boosting the ice sheet’s contribution to global sea level rise and, perhaps, causing unexpected changes.

Yet somehow the river has, so far, powered through, delivering an almost indescribable bounty to the more than 60 million people who depend on it for their livelihoods.

Start Planning Now for America’s 2017 Eclipse,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/start-planning-now-for-americas-2017-eclipse,03-19-2015,Pick your spot now to see America’s top eclipse this century. …,"There are, around the world, groups of people so fierce about solar eclipses, they plan their years and even decades around the movements of Earth and the moon. An eclipse happens whenever the moon passes in front of the sun, but a full eclipse is far more rare. And when it does occur, there are only a few places on Earth where you can see it.

There will be precisely 222 total eclipses in the 21st century. Since 2000, there have already been 30. The full solar eclipse on August 21, 2017, however, may be the best of them all simply for its utter convenience, particularly if you’re in America.

Consider this map made by eclipse data fan Xavier Jubier, which shows the sweeping path that almost perfectly bisects North America. At 10:15 a.m. PST, as the moon and Earth continue their usual orbits, the shadow of the moon will begin to sweep from Oregon to South Carolina, passing through parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia. Standing anywhere in the path will provide two minutes (give or take) of shadow-filled darkness in the middle of the day. Using data from the U.S. Naval Observatory, the green pin marks the area of longest duration of total eclipse—2 minutes and 44 seconds in southern Illinois.

83.07 DEGREES NORTH — We awoke to a deafening noise. First a low grumble and a moan, then high-pitched screeches that brought to mind a freight train grinding to a halt. The whole ship trembled and rocked. Then a peaceful quiet returned.

Outside the Lance’s frost-covered portholes, the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean appeared transformed. Huge slabs of snowpacked ice were piled up nearly as high as the port-side railing. The barren white plain beyond had become strewn with rubble. Squeezed on both sides, the Lance had been lifted three feet (one meter). It was as though, overnight, some titanic bulldozer had rumbled in from the south and rearranged the entire jigsaw puzzle of sea ice in its path.

“There is a pleasant, comfortable feeling in sitting listening to all this uproar and knowing the strength of our ship,” the great Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen wrote more than a century ago, as he drifted across the Arctic onboard the Fram. “Many a one would have been crushed long ago.” Editor’s Note: This is the third dispatch from aboard the R.V.

In the simulation, plumes of the greenhouse gas gush into the atmosphere from major industrial centers, swirling from continent to continent on the winds of global weather systems.

The simulation, which took 75 days to create on a supercomputer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, depicts CO2 emissions from May 2005 to June 2007. Its superhigh-resolution mapping—64 times as great as the average climate model—dramatically illustrates two often neglected facts.

The first is that CO2 emissions come almost exclusively from the Northern Hemisphere.

Summer storms can strike suddenly.

But who among us hasn’t experienced the dread of seeing storm clouds form as if out of nowhere in the hot afternoon, followed by a mad scramble for cover as a thunderstorm suddenly strikes?

Why do storms always seem to strike so much more frequently in the summer?

The simple reason is that summer weather often provides the perfect conditions for storms to develop. Warm temperatures allow the atmosphere to hold more humidity, and that humidity is a prerequisite for building clouds—specifically, the tall, menacing cumulonimbus clouds that produce thunder and lightning.

Photographer Lesley Roy captured pictures of the bird, which she nicknamed Spoonie. “At one point after I spent several hours snapping every move, Spoonie burst into a dance of feathers flying, wings up to the sky, that took my breath away,"" Roy says. ""Then it turned to fix my gaze, as if to say, You got that, didn't you?”"
"Switch to Natural Gas Won't Reduce Carbon Emissions Much, Study Finds",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/140924-natural-gas-impact-on-emissions,09-25-2014,"Switching power plants from coal to gas will make us use more electricity and delay the dawn of renewables, a new study claims.","Switching from coal to natural gas for power generation won't do much to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and might even raise them slightly, in part because it will discourage the use of carbon-free renewable energy, according to a study released Wednesday.

Increased use of natural gas has been widely credited with having reduced U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in recent years. But the new study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, finds that between 2013 and 2055 the use of natural gas could reduce cumulative emissions from the electricity sector by no more than 9 percent, a reduction the authors say will have an insignificant impact on climate. The power sector accounts for around a third of U.S. emissions.

The researchers—from the University of California, Irvine; Stanford University; and the nonprofit organization Near Zero—examined varying combinations of natural gas supply and climate policies. In some scenarios, they found that use of natural gas would actually boost emissions from the power sector by up to 5 percent.

The news is relentless sometimes. While we were wondering whether Henri would become the first hurricane in decades to strike New England, flash floods in Tennessee killed at least 21. While American eyes have been focused on fires in the West, more than 15 million acres of forest have already burned this year in Siberia, as Madeleine Stone writes for Nat Geo—an area nearly the size of West Virginia.

Over the next few decades on the climate beat, there will be a lot more seasons like this one. Things are going to get worse before they get better, the recent IPCC report tells us. A UNICEF report released last week found that a billion children worldwide are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The “picture is almost unimaginably dire,” UNICEF executive director Henriette Fore said. (Above, a family enjoys the beach despite the thick smoke over Yakutsk, in east Siberia.)

History expands the imagination. Picture this planet a century ago: World War I had just killed 20 million people and the influenza pandemic at least 50 million more. The next 25 years would see a global economic depression and World War II, which killed another 60 million. If any period in human history was apocalyptic, it was the first half of the 20th century.

But the second half saw the greatest improvements ever in humanity’s material well-being—especially in child mortality, which plummeted. Globally, it’s about a fifth what it was in the middle of the 20th century.

All that progress was powered by fossil fuels, which means it came at the expense of the global environment—a realization the world is now very belatedly acting on. What form will that action take over the rest of this century? (Below, Elizabeth Yefimova, 18, and Ilya Alekseyev, 20, wear respirators as thick smoke hangs over Yakutsk.)

As Stone explains in another piece for us, the IPCC considered five scenarios. In the first two, global greenhouse gas emissions start declining by 2025, and by the second half of the century we’re drawing massive amounts of carbon back out of the atmosphere. Those scenarios keep global warming below the Paris Agreement target of 2 degrees Celsius. Both are decidedly optimistic—but as climate scientist Zeke Hausfather told Stone, “very much on the table” if major countries meet the net-zero pledges they’ve been making.

The last two of the five IPCC scenarios describe “a dark future…and a strange one,” Stone writes. In the dark future, nationalism replaces global cooperation, population soars to 12 billion, and greenhouse emissions, instead of falling, double by 2100. In the strange future they even triple. The world goes all-in on fossil-fuel-driven growth, burning through more coal than we even know we have. The planet’s temperature rises, in the IPCC’s best estimate, by 4.4°C, or 7.9°F.

Since global coal consumption has actually been declining in the past decade, the IPCC’s most dire future is also its most unlikely. To be sure, it’s not impossible—the Siberian fires, which have released about as much carbon as Germany does in a year, almost 800 million metric tons, are a reminder of the climate feedbacks that could yet haunt our future, even if we’re not so dumb as to quintuple our coal burning. But it’s also not the road we seem to be on.

We seem instead to be traveling the middle of the IPCC’s five roads: the one where the nations of the world muddle along, slowly getting their act together, shifting away from fossil fuels and reducing emissions to near zero by the end of the century. The planet warms, in the IPCC’s best estimate, around 2.7° C, or less than 5°F—which is way too much, but closer to the path we want. (Pictured above, plants climb the red trellises in Singapore's Gardens by the Bay.)

The 21st-century road back to a stable climate will be long, as was the road back from almost unimaginable global destruction in the 20th century. Even on the 2-degree or 1.5-degree routes, there will be many more news seasons like this one. But if we can manage to see them as grievously hard bits of road, rather than harbingers of the apocalypse, we’ll be more likely to get home.

Talking to kids about climate change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/talking-to-your-kids-about-climate-change,11-27-2017,How to tackle a complicated—and sometimes scary—subject with your children,"Climate change is a hot topic (sorry—no pun intended) that children want to understand. Problem is, it’s a topic that can be hard for adults to comprehend. So how do you translate science-speak into kid-speak without overwhelming them—or even scaring them? Here are some ideas to break down climate change basics so you can empower your children to be part of the solution.

Explaining the science
The Earth's atmosphere seen from space

Understanding climate change starts with understanding the atmosphere. Explain to your child that the atmosphere surrounds the Earth like a bubble and protects us from the harshest rays of the sun and the cold of space. It also contains greenhouse gases, which include the air we breathe (oxygen) and others that help keep the Earth at the perfect temperature. Finally, the atmosphere naturally releases extra gases into space.

The problem, of course, is that over the last 150 years, the levels of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere has increased. Ask your child to list all the things that need power to work: cars, lights, refrigerators, etc. Then explain that the power comes from burning coal, natural gas, and oil, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Your kid can then think about what people used to do before these things were invented to understand why the level of greenhouse gases has increased so much.

Maybe your kid is now thinking: But if the atmosphere naturally releases the gases into space, what’s the problem? Tell them to think about the steam created when someone showers with the bathroom door closed. The steam is trapped and warms the bathroom. Too many greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are like the steam in the bathroom: The gases are trapped and warm the planet. And when the Earth warms, its climate changes.

Explaining the problem

Climate is the pattern of weather conditions over many years. Children can think of that in terms of the town where they live. For instance, ask your kid to tell you what the weather conditions are always like during a certain month: Snowy and cold in February? Rainy and windy in March? Hot and dry in August? A child can then describe the overall climate of the town based on the weather conditions that happen during that month every year.

Most visitors ride park buses to marvel at grizzly and black bears, wolves, caribou, moose, and Dall sheep—the “Big Five” wildlife species—and hope for a peek at North America’s tallest mountain—20,310-foot Denali—which is often shrouded by clouds.

But in recent years, the 92-mile-long Denali Park Road that provides park access has experienced slumps and slides—which require considerable maintenance and occasionally block the road—and scientists believe climate change is likely to blame. Road maintenance challenges are just one of the many effects that warming temperatures are having on Alaska’s national parks.

Like much of Alaska, many parts of Denali National Park are underlain with permafrost, meaning ground that remains at or below freezing for two or more years in a row. As climate change warms the planet, much of the shallow permafrost is thawing. In the 1950s, 75 percent of Denali had near-surface permafrost, which is located just below the active layer that freezes and thaws seasonally. The figure dropped to around 50 percent in the 2000s and is projected to drop to 6 percent by the 2050s. In areas where the near-surface permafrost is thawing, deeper permafrost may still exist, since permafrost can be hundreds of feet thick, and even over 2,000 feet thick in some northern locations in Alaska.

It encircles the Arctic, and flows beneath it. Most of the Arctic Ocean is covered by ice throughout the year—although that is starting to change as temperatures climb.

Over time, the earth below weakened and grew soupy. This once-hard soil, thick with ice, was heating up, sinking and filling with rain and snow melt.

Scientists have known for decades that as rising temperatures thaw the northern latitudes, previously frozen soil called permafrost will release greenhouse gases, which in turn will speed up global climate change.

But based in part on what they learned by studying Alaska’s “drunken forests,” Turetsky, Jones and a team of experts this week confirmed something else: Warming of small patches of frozen ground that contain large veins of ice will release far more emissions than once thought.

Six zipped her jacket and ambled into the woods with an ax. She stopped at a mixed stand of emerald and burnt-orange lodgepoles. With the ax blade, she gently peeled a strip of bark from a green tree, exposing the pale wood beneath. There, wedged into narrow channels carved into the wood, were tiny black larvae the size of sesame seeds. They were dead, done in by an early hard frost—but it had come too late to save the lodgepole. Though the tree appeared to be thriving, its phloem, the fibrous layer under the bark that transports nutrients, was dry and brown.

Six moved to the next tree, another seemingly healthy one. Its phloem was greenish pink and pliant, clearly still hydrated. But it was laced with the same telltale channels. From their size and the lack of larvae, Six concluded that this tree had been invaded as recently as a week earlier. As she peeled back the bark with her ax, she accidentally squished a small black beetle.

Across western North America, in millions of acres of pine forest, the story is the same. Drive through parts of Colorado, and you’ll encounter entire mountainsides painted with rust. From valley bottoms all the way to the tree line, nearly every single pine has been killed by an enemy smaller than a thumbtack: the mountain pine beetle. Tour British Columbia, and the scale of destruction is even more appalling. More than 44 million acres of pine trees there, an area the size of Missouri, have been attacked to varying degrees over the past 15 years.

Due to an ongoing drought, the nomads’ livestock faced a lack of adequate forage in the grasslands along the country’s northern border with Russia, and they went into this year’s winter season much thinner than usual. If a bad winter follows a lean summer, livestock can burn through their fat reserves faster, and herders must turn to their hay reserves months earlier than usual.

The Face of Water Shortages: A Lake That Serially Vanishes,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/further-drought,03-01-2017,"This month’s FURTHER essay visits a Bolivian lake basin at the mercy of water diversion, weather extremes, and climate change.","This story appears in the March 2017 issue of National Geographic magazine.

In the high plains of Bolivia, a man surveys the baked remains of what was the country’s second largest lake. For centuries locals rafted on the waters and lived off the fish and waterfowl of Lake Poopó. Once covering some 1,100 square miles, the lake had shrunk and resurged in the past—but in late 2015 it virtually vanished. In a coming issue Kenneth R. Weiss will report on its demise.

Some three-fourths of jobs in the global workforce are dependent on water, according to a 2016 UN report on water and development. Agriculture, fishing, energy, transport—if their water sources dry up, livelihoods do too.

Many lakes face a common menace: climate change. When its effects alter habitats, disrupt food webs, and spawn extreme weather, that can lead to people being “uprooted from their homes,” Weiss says. War drives much of today’s forced migration, but climate change also is a factor, he says.

What doomed Lake Poopó? Water diversions upstream, weather extremes—and perhaps, one man told Weiss, too few sacrifices to the rain gods. But other locals—those who haven’t left—don’t dwell much on causes, Weiss says, “they’re just trying to figure out how the hell they’re going to feed their kids tonight.”

The Fascinating Ways People Are Adapting to Climate Change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/field-notes-climate-change-adaptations,08-17-2016,Innovative solutions to a warming world from Madagascar to Bangladesh,"This story appears in the September 2016 issue of National Geographic magazine.

For years Alizé Carrère had heard about the disastrous effects of climate change, especially in developing countries. But in 2012 Carrère learned of a very different situation: a group of farmers in Madagascar who were figuring out how to farm in fields eroded by deforestation and heavy rains. Instead of depending on development aid to reforest washed-out areas, the farmers adapted. Soon they began to prefer farming in the eroded gullies, which became rich with water and nutrients.

That sort of ingenuity in the face of hardship launched Carrère, a National Geographic grantee, on a journey to study climate change adaptation. “It’s such an abstract concept, so I wanted to know what it actually looked like,” she says. This year she and a film crew are documenting cases in which environmental change has spurred human inventiveness and turning the stories into a video series called Adaptation.

Her first stop? Bangladesh, a low-lying, densely populated country where scientists expect rising water to displace 18 million people by 2050. In the southern district of Gopalganj, Carrère watched people build floating gardens from water hyacinth, bamboo, and manure to help them fish, raise ducks, and grow produce. She saw how ingenuity can beget more of the same: A Bangladeshi architect took inspiration from the floating fields and engineered boats to serve as floating schools, hospitals, libraries, and playgrounds.

Since Bangladesh, Carrère has visited northern India to see how glacial melt is being repurposed to feed a desert ecosystem and will go next to Vanuatu, where grinding sea stars into fertilizer helps grow food.

Some of the best adaptation ideas come from kids, Carrère says. They’re creative, malleable, and excited to dream up new things. They also have the most at stake. This story appears in the September 2016 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Winston Churchill saw the gathering storm long before the rest of the world. Europe sacrificed millions of people before it openly acknowledged and then directly confronted the crisis. Yet, even after the Allies responded, the outcome was uncertain. Only when the U.S. entered the fray could the Allies see a clear path to end the threat.

Here’s how he might respond.,"Donald Trump’s surprising victory in the U.S. presidential election will ignite a dramatic change to U.S. environmental policy. Trump has signaled that his administration will reject President Barack Obama’s policies aimed at combating climate change, a move that likely would throw international efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions into chaos.

The stakes for the United States, and the world, are enormous: If humankind does not reduce its greenhouse gas emissions immediately, climate scientists say, Earth could face as much as 11 degrees Fahrenheit of warming by 2100 relative to preindustrial temperatures, leading to increases in droughts and wildfires, rising seas, and major disruptions to global agriculture.

In fact, the effects of climate change already are being felt, including rising anomalies in global temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification, an uptick in the frequency and severity of heatwaves, losses of land ice in Antarctica and Greenland, and changes in the ranges of many plant and animal species.

But Paris is not just about these two powerhouses, even though they account for one-third of fossil fuel emissions. Curbing the threat posed by climate change truly takes global action.

So far, more than 150 countries – from Sudan to Suriname and from Kiribati to Kyrgyzstan – have outlined for United Nations negotiators just how, when, and by how much each would cut carbon dioxide over the next several decades. If an agreement is reached during the talks that start Nov. 30, it would mark the first serious global commitment to reduce the pollution that is warming the planet, souring the oceans, and causing seas to rise.

So who are the climate heroes? Which countries are doing the most (or least) to tackle greenhouse gases? It's not easy to discern. For starters, these pledges are not binding. Any country can change its mind at any point, though the hope is that international pressure would make that difficult. And some countries are a bigger part of the problem than others.

The Great Barrier Reef’s corals are struggling to recover fast enough,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/great-barrier-reef-coral-not-recovering-climate-change,04-03-2019,Climate change is making ocean heat waves worse—a reality that increases the chances for mass bleaching and puts young coral in jeopardy.,"In the hottest days of Australia's summer, just after a full moon, the Great Barrier Reef experiences an underwater snowstorm.

Along the massive stretch of reefs corals release millions of sticky eggs and sperm that float up to the water's surface and combine. They will eventually form larvae. Some will float down and settle on the nearby ocean floor, while others might be swept along by a current.

New research published Wednesday in Nature finds that warmer waters are making it harder for corals to reproduce en masse. In fact, following a major coral bleaching event in 2017 the amount of reproductive material collected in the water after a mass spawning event was down by 89 percent in the Great Barrier Reef in 2018. It will take five to 10 years for coral to fully recover, the researchers estimate.

Some say she’s ahead of the curve. Others call Greta Thunberg and her low-carbon tour of America overhyped. There’s no question that the teenage environmental warrior has raised big issues for travelers: How much can we travel without hurting the world for future generations?

We asked 2,200 Americans about it and found nearly a quarter of them have changed their travel habits to be more environmentally friendly, according to a National Geographic-Morning Consult poll. The poll found 24 percent—and more than a third of respondents under 30— had changed their plans in various ways, including limiting air travel or avoiding overtouristed places.

Speaking of overtouristed, my tip from June: Stay away from the mass of humanity that clogs the arteries of Porto in the summertime. (I recommend beating the crowds by going to the Portuguese city in the autumn.)

Hello, again: America is considering rejoining the U.N.’s World Tourism Organization, Skift reports. It's a big change for the United States, which dropped out two decades ago over questions whether the organization was worth it. Will the UK, Canada, and Australia join as well?

Amid the protests: After four months of demonstrations, how can visitors stay safe in Hong Kong? David Swanson, writing for National Geographic Travel, checked on safety with the tourist booth at the airport, then found the sparsely attended Zoological and Botanical Gardens and no wait for the normally packerd Peak Tram.

The Gulf of Maine is warming fast. What does that mean for lobsters—and everything else?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/gulf-of-maine-climate-change-photographer,05-14-2024,"National Geographic photographer Brian Skerry has been diving in the Gulf of Maine for more than 40 years. After learning these waters were a harbinger of climate change, he set out to document the rapid shift and its ripple effects.","The bounty of the Gulf of Maine. The sea within a sea, as it’s often called, is a body of water that extends 36,000 square miles along the eastern seaboard of North America, from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to New Brunswick, and encompasses the coastlines of New Hampshire, Maine, and Nova Scotia. Indigenous Americans who have lived in this region for more than 12,000 years learned the gulf’s natural rhythms and sustainably harvested its rich waters. Europeans who began to settle in the area in the 15th century recorded tales of an endless abundance, with cod that measured up to five feet long. Before the American Revolution began, giant lobsters and thick schools of fish would have had a front-row seat to the Boston Tea Party.

I think of the Gulf of Maine as having been created from a perfect recipe that required a precise series of ingredients and steps. There is a robust watershed with many rivers flowing into the sea and a unique blend of currents that bring and mix nutrients, including upwelling from the continental shelf, the Gulf Stream, the Labrador, and counterclockwise coastal currents. Because of the Gulf of Maine’s geographic location in a temperate zone, a seasonal stratification that separates water into warmer and cooler layers also occurs here. The result has historically been the proliferation of life. But things have changed. The bounty of the Gulf of Maine.

I’ve seen this on a very small scale walking frozen creeks in winter fed by groundwater, but this was quite amazing at 800 feet. Groundwater is difficult to capture in a beautiful way in an image. I guess it takes getting up in the air sometimes to see it.

Soldiers on horseback capturing ships stuck in the ice. Indigenous populations using snowshoes to outfox English interlopers. Accused witches put on trial as their communities struggled to explain crop failures and extreme cold.

These were some of the images that define the Little Ice Age—a period of several centuries last millennium in which parts of the Northern Hemisphere grappled with a persistent cold. But what caused the Little Ice Age, how long did it last, how did people adapt to its frigid grip—and what lessons can we learn as we enter our own period of climatic change?

What is the Little Ice Age—and what caused it?

The Little Ice Age was not a true ice age—average cooling was probably only in the order of 0.5 degrees Celsius, or 1 degree Fahrenheit—nor was it consistently cold. Dagomar Degroot, associate professor of environmental history at Georgetown University and author of The Frigid Golden Age has referred to the era as a series of “little little ice ages.”

Although some researchers argue it may have begun earlier, NASA defines the Little Ice Age as beginning around 1550 and consisting of three cold peaks—around 1650, 1770 and 1850—interspersed with relative warm intervals.

Even after decades of study, the details surrounding the sea’s vanishing act and the torrents of water that refilled the basin remain an enduring mystery. The refilling of the Mediterranean about five million years ago may have been the biggest flood in our planet’s history. By one estimate, the cascade of water that filled the cavernous basin was about 500 times larger than the flow of the Amazon River.

“It was a sensational thing,” says Daniel García-Castellanos of the Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera in Spain. In a recent analysis published in Earth-Science Reviews, Garcia-Castellanos and his team identified a pocket of sediments that may have been deposited by the megaflood.

I was on the lookout for a companion that at least somewhat resembled the gray wolf stock from which our domesticated canine companions descended. A real canid. Jet, a black German shepherd I took in earlier this summer, met that description perfectly.

But while I appreciate that Jet has a bit of ancient wolfishness about him, he’s not anything like the earliest dogs. Those dawn canids, which split from their cat cousins around 50 million years ago, were more weasel-like than any modern pooch. These were little ambush predators with dexterous forelimbs that let them grapple with prey. Wolves and other canids as we know them today – pursuit predators that use teeth, rather than paws, to catch and dispatch their victims – are relatively new creatures, and the last remaining sliver of what was once a wider array of prehistoric dogs.

A pair of papers published this month by two different teams of researchers tell the tale. The latest, published today by Universidad de Málaga‘s Borja Figueirido and colleagues, tracks how prehistoric dogs changed as forests gave way to grasslands.

The U.S. has officially left the Paris Agreement. What happens next?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/us-officially-left-paris-agreement-whats-next-climate,11-04-2020,"The withdrawal has been expected for years, but marks “a bitter moment,” experts say.","On Wednesday, November 4, the United States officially withdraws from the Paris Agreement, the landmark international accord to keep climate change in check and limit future greenhouse gas emissions. The exit occurs regardless of the outcome of Tuesday’s vote, but the winner of the presidential election will decide whether to stay out or to rejoin the landmark climate deal.

The U.S. is now the only major country in the world not committed to the accord, which aims to keep global temperatures from rising more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial temperatures. It is no surprise—President Trump announced his intention to leave the agreement in 2017 and began proceedings to do so in November 2019. But the move is in keeping with Trump’s agenda to reduce efforts to address climate change in recent years, says Kate Larsen, an analyst at the climate-focused Rhodium Group.

A future president can decide to rejoin the pact at any time, but will have to revise the country’s plans and submit new, more ambitious goals—which may be more difficult to reach after several years of delays, says Andrew Light, a climate expert at the World Resources Institute and an architect of the agreement reached under President Obama. But even without federal support, the U.S. has made progress toward decarbonization, and that forward motion is likely to continue with or without membership in the accord.

The Weird World of Lobster Sex,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/basic-instincts-lobster-sex,07-11-2017,"These crustaceans' assignations involve urine squirting and shell molting. What's more, their reproduction is threatened by climate change.","This story appears in the July 2017 issue of National Geographic magazine.

To a lobster couple, this is normal sex:

For days the female squirts urine into the den of her desired mate. Beguiled by the scent, he lets her move in. Foreplay—stroking each other with antennae and with feet covered in taste receptors—lasts several days.

Once she’s convinced that he’ll protect her, the female disrobes, slowly shedding both her hard shell and the pouch where she had banked sperm from a prior mate. Molting leaves her in a perilously soft new shell, so he stands guard for the half hour it takes to harden. Then, supported by his claw legs, he suspends himself above her and lifts her to face him, cradling her in his legs. Her new shell has a new sperm pouch; he thrusts a packet of sperm into it using appendages called gonopods. The deed is done.

As soon as one mate leaves, the male will welcome another. The female, meanwhile, will use the sperm packet to fertilize thousands of eggs, which she’ll carry under her tail for about a year until the larvae hatch.

But climate change is threatening this babymaking process, says Diane Cowan, founder of the Lobster Conservancy. This story appears in the July 2017 issue of National Geographic magazine.

The Aliso Canyon leak is huge—California’s largest known source of methane emissions at this point—but not compared to another font of wasted gas miles away in Venezuela.

Punta de Mata is home to the world’s largest gas flare, one of the flaming chimneys used to burn off excess natural gas at oil wells and other energy sites. In 2012, it incinerated about 768,000 metric tons of natural gas, almost 10 times the amount given off so far from the Southern California Gas Company’s facility at Aliso Canyon.

Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is 84 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide over two decades. As countries seek to comply with the new UN climate accord by slashing emissions, both gas flaring and leaks remain persistent problems.

The World's Most Improbable Green City,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/dubai-ecological-footprint-sustainable-urban-city,04-04-2017,A decade ago Dubai had one of the largest ecological footprints of any city in the world. By 2050 it wants to have the smallest. Can it get there?,"To plunge headlong into the audacity of Dubai—the sprawling efflorescence of concrete, glass, and steel that has sprung up over the past three decades on the scorched sands of Arabia—you could start by going skiing. Smack in the middle of the flat city, the slope looks like a silver spaceship impaled in the ground floor of the Mall of the Emirates. Inside, you can window-shop at Prada, Dior, and Alexander McQueen before pushing through the glass doors of Ski Dubai. Passing a mural of the Alps, you zip up your parka, pull on your gloves. You begin to marvel then at what air-conditioning can do, when pushed to its limits.

The souvenir T-shirt I bought bears a cartoon of a Celsius thermometer. “I went from +50 to -8,” it said. It didn’t feel quite as cold as minus eight (14°F) on the slope, but the temperature outside can get close to 50 (122°F) in summer. The humidity is stifling then, because of the proximity of the sea. Yet it rarely rains; Dubai gets less than four inches a year. There are no permanent rivers. There is next to no soil suitable for growing crops.

What kind of human settlement makes sense in such a place? For centuries Dubai was a fishing village and trading port, small and poor. Then oil and a wild real estate boom transformed it into a city that sports the world’s tallest building, one of its densest collections of skyscrapers, and its third busiest airport. “From the point of view of sustainability you probably wouldn’t have done it here,” says Janus Rostock, a prominent architect transplanted from Copenhagen.

Some 60 percent of that came from burning fossil fuels, mostly natural gas, in some 10,000 generators, large and small, around the country. All of that electricity will need to be replaced—and more, because demand for electricity is expected to rise, especially if we power more cars with it.

There’s a movement out there to shame us from flying—because if you fly in planes, it’s by far the biggest contributor to your personal carbon footprint. Along with the pandemic, flight-shaming has had one good effect: It has made at least some of us think about how unnecessary some of those trips we take are, especially the ones for business.

But if you’d like to feel inspired rather than ashamed about that future, check out October's issue of National Geographic, and in particular the illustration showing a proposed V-shaped plane (video of it being tested above). The prototype is far more aerodynamic and fuel-efficient than current models. And the fuel, in this design, is hydrogen, which emits no carbon dioxide when it’s burned.

As the cover feature makes clear, zero-emissions flight is a thorny engineering problem that we’re decades away from fully solving—but the solutions, including short-hop electric planes, are on the way.

If you want to be part of the green-transportation future, check out the companion feature on electric cars by Craig Welch—and start thinking about which EV model you’re going to buy when your smelly old internal combustion engine wears out (assuming you haven’t been persuaded to ride a bike instead). Within 20 years, as another cool graphic illustrates, electric cars will dominate the global market for new vehicles. (Above left, a Rolls-Royce turbofan engine, which may someday run entirely on sustainable fuels; above right, a fan case for the engine.)

Will the new cars and planes arrive fast enough to keep dangerous climate change in check? The good news is that aviation, though the lion’s share of some individual carbon footprints, accounts for only a few percent of global emissions. Cars and trucks are a much bigger problem—and we have the technology to solve it. We just have to roll it out ASAP.

"The gas in this exploding mine is odorless, colorless—and could transform the world",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/exploding-mine-albania-bulqize-hydrogen,03-07-2024,The discovery of a large cache of hydrogen deep in an Albanian mine has researchers searching for more of the gas trapped in the earth.,"Geological fieldwork occasionally happens in dangerous places, from the slopes of erupting volcanoes to the depths of frigid Antarctic chasms. Even so, they tend not to take place inside exploding mines.

That, however, is exactly where a team of scientists went exploring: the Bulqizë chromite mine in Albania, just northeast of the capital Tirana. And instead of looking for valuable minerals or beguiling rock formations, they were seeking the source of those explosions: almost-pure hydrogen gas—a potentially renewable energy source that could transform the world.

As reported in a recent study in the journal Science, the team found it. Deep below ground, they encountered a small pool effervescing like a frenzied jacuzzi. “The gas was really intense,” says Bardhyl Muceku, a geologist at the Polytechnic University of Tirana and one of the study’s authors. About 84 percent of the gas was hydrogen—and this was one of several seeps in the Bulqizë mine that, in total, was venting at least 200 tons of hydrogen every single year.

The world is several years away from being able to extricate meaningful volumes of natural hydrogen gas from the earth cheaply, cleanly, and efficiently. First, those reservoirs need to be found.

“There’s a lot of work to be done,” says Geoffrey Ellis, a petroleum geochemist with the U.S. Geological Survey who wasn’t involved with the work. But discoveries like Bulqizë are cause for optimism that there may be enough hydrogen trapped underground to power the planet. “This could work,” he adds.

SOURCE: NASA“It’s a long-term trip up the elevator of warming,” says Deke Arndt, the chief of the global monitoring branch of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information in North Carolina. According to new reports published Wednesday, the last five years—from 2014 to 2018—are the warmest years ever recorded in the 139 years that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has tracked global heat. And 2018 was the fourth hottest year ever recorded. Global air temperatures have warmed steadily over past decades, shifting up and down slightly from year to year depending on natural climate oscillations like El Niño, but following a consistent upward path. Land temperatures, they said, were more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 20th century average.

The last flower at the top of the world—and the perilous journey to reach it,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/northernmost-plant-moss-arctic-poppy,05-08-2024,Scientists journeyed to a stretch of gravel off the coast of Greenland—the farthest north you can go and still walk on land. These photos show what they found there.,"At the top of the Earth, the northernmost stretch of land a person can stand on is Inuit Qeqertaat, also named Kaffeklubben Island by early 20th century Danish explorers. The region is a dark gray stretch of gravel on the northern coast of Greenland where land slowly gives way to frozen sea ice.

To find what lives amid these rocky soils, climate change researchers and National Geographic Explorers Brian Buma and Jeff Kerby and their team embarked on a journey to survey the region. There, they found a common species of moss (Tortula mucronifolia), the world's northernmost plant, and a yellow and lime-green Arctic poppy (Papaver radicatum), growing just a few inches south of the moss. 

On the nearby mainland, Greenlandic archaeologist Aka Simonsen discovered a ring of roughly 700-year-old Inuit stones, which may be the northernmost archaeological remains.

The link between extreme weather and climate change has never been more clear,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/scientists-accurately-pinpoint-climate-contribution-extreme-weather,06-10-2024,Experts say drawing the direct connection from specific storms to the nebulous idea of climate change can help people grasp the urgency of our crisis.,"A decade ago, scientists would say they were pretty sure a specific hurricane, heatwave, flood, drought or raging wildfire was more severe due to climate change, but they could rarely pinpoint its exact contribution. Now, thanks to a convergence of human brainpower, mathematical models, precise weather data, and superpower computers, climate fingerprints are being calculated for many major weather events.

The purpose of this climate attribution is to drive home the extent that greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuel relates to the weather effects people are seeing. 

“We want everyone to understand how what we as humans have done translates into the intensities and frequencies of extreme events,” says Joyce Kimutai, a climate scientist at the London-based nonprofit World Weather Attribution (WWA), a leader in this research. “We’re not saying that climate change caused a particular extreme weather event. What we are saying is, ‘Here’s the extent climate change has modified it’.”  A decade ago, scientists would say they were pretty sure a specific hurricane, heatwave, flood, drought or raging wildfire was more severe due to climate change, but they could rarely pinpoint its exact contribution.

The microbial shifts that could change the Arctic forever,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/partner-content-microbial-shifts-and-arctic,11-10-2016,Tiny microorganisms in the Arctic are reacting to the warming climate—and that could have consequences for all life on Earth.,"Martin Nielsen reaches over the gunwale of the Porsild and grabs the 100-meter-long bongo net as it is winched out of the Arctic water. He’s helped by one of the crew, Eli Martensen—a ruddy-cheeked Inuit fisherman who’s a regular on these monthly field excursions.

The net is designed to trap some of the ocean’s smallest organisms: zooplankton. As it is dragged on board, Nielsen, a molecular biologist and currently scientific leader of Arctic Station on Disko Island off the coast of western Greenland, transfers his catch to a sample jar and holds it aloft. Myriad translucent shrimp-like creatures drift in the water as if in a snow globe.

When you talk about microorganisms in the ocean, you have to realize there are so many of them,” Nielsen explains. “They are a vital part of the food chain.” Martin Nielsen reaches over the gunwale of the Porsild and grabs the 100-meter-long bongo net as it is winched out of the Arctic water.

The most consequential impact of Trump’s climate policies? Wasted time.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/most-consequential-impact-of-trumps-climate-policies-wasted-time,12-11-2020,"We added a lot of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere during the Trump years, but the biggest loss was failing to make forward progress, experts say.","For decades, climate experts have warned that delaying action to limit global warming would make the problem more dangerous and harder to solve. So how much impact did four years of delay under President Donald J. Trump actually have?

On the total amount of extra carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere in the past few years, surprisingly little, says Leah Stokes, a climate policy expert at the University of California, Santa Barbara. But the bigger cost was to slow down progress that was being made. Climate and economic costs of creating a future with fewer fossil fuels are increasing steeply each year, so an extra four years on hold, at least in the United States, puts even more pressure on future leaders.

“It’s not just that we’ve been moving in the wrong direction, but also we haven’t been moving in the right direction,” Stokes says. For decades, climate experts have warned that delaying action to limit global warming would make the problem more dangerous and harder to solve. So how much impact did four years of delay under President Donald J. Trump actually have?

Their wait might soon be over—and if you’re not a meteorologist, you may be surprised to learn that it’s because of a recent spike in Arctic temperatures.

To explain a quantity of this size, the Ulster University glaciologist must use analogies.

Depending on how you look at it, 267 billion metric tons of water is roughly half the volume of Lake Erie. Or six months of discharge from the Mississippi River. Or all the water in a 10-foot-deep swimming pool that’s the size of Ireland. “It’s really hard to grok,” McNabb tells me.

If we could imagine all that water—a pool as big as Ireland—could we also imagine that much ice melting every year for the past two decades?

Three-quarters of open-ocean shark and ray species are threatened with extinction, primarily because of overfishing.

For years, scientists have warned that these plummeting numbers could be catastrophic. Because sharks are top predators that help keep the food web in check, it would logically follow that they are keystone species—species that have a disproportionately large effect on their ecosystems. Without keystone species, ecosystems change or even disappear. (Here's why keystone species are so important.)

For sharks, however, this idea has long been mostly theoretical. The fish and their marine habitats are tough to study, requiring special gear just to get in the water and observe them. The more than 500 known shark species also vary in size, prey on different animals, and live in dramatically different environments, where it’s almost impossible to pinpoint the influence of one species.

The wait is over: The green travel revolution is here.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/the-wait-is-over-the-green-travel-revolution-is-here,09-23-2021,"As we battle climate change, there are reasons for optimism: emissions-reduction strides in autos today, and aircraft in the near future.","We’re in the middle of one revolution—and are soon to launch another. These upheavals, both leading to a more sustainable future, are the products not of human conflict but of human ingenuity. Simply put, we’re utterly reinventing how we get from here to there.

“Cars and trucks are undergoing their greatest makeover since the automobile’s inception more than a century ago,” writer Craig Welch notes in the first of this issue’s two stories on the future of transportation. Almost overnight, electric cars are proliferating, as carbon dioxide-belching internal combustion engines head for the endangered species list.

In air transportation, the other mode we examine, change is more gradual. There are promising developments in sustainable aviation fuel made from waste products, planes fueled by “green” hydrogen, and aircraft with zero-emission, battery-powered electric engines.

Most market-level change still is on the horizon. For example, says writer Sam Howe Verhovek, there’s no battery that can get a Boeing 747 from New York to London: “It would take the juice of 4.4 million laptop batteries just to generate liftoff. Except that the jumbo jet could never get off the ground: The batteries would weigh seven times as much as the plane.”

Concern about climate change is driving these economic and consumer shifts. But progress is taking too long: Our planet’s health depends on zeroing out carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 at the latest, climate change experts say.

Each of us may note this differently. For me, it’s the birds that no longer migrate south in the winter; I see them all year long now. And why in the world is the forsythia blooming in January?

Ultimately, to solve global warming, we must drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Part one of this month’s cover story package addresses that challenge. It looks at heat and how humans—who evolved during the past 10,000 years in an average air temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit—must adapt to a steamy new reality but also work to mitigate it. 

Part two of the package explores a low-tech, immediate solution to heat: shade. We’re well aware of its public health benefit, as being in the shade can make us feel up to 20 degrees cooler than if we were in the sun. That principle applies to where we live as well. A recent study found that neighborhoods with dense tree canopy and parks and other open spaces averaged about five degrees cooler than neighborhoods without those attributes—in the very same cities. We tell our shade story from Los Angeles. 

You likely won’t be surprised to learn that the hotter neighborhoods tend to be lower-income areas where people of color form a larger share of the population. Redlining and discrimination have long denied people home loans and stifled community investment. The legacy of those inequalities makes shade itself a fraught commodity. It’s not just a way to keep cool; it’s a lasting measure of privilege on one hand and environmental racism on the other.  Science tells us unequivocally that the world is getting hotter: The past six years have been the warmest on record.

High in the Himalaya, a desert is turning green.

Climate change in the Indian region of Ladakh has shrunk glaciers and made rainfall and temperatures unpredictable. Water is needed to irrigate the fields of barley, apples, and other crops in spring, but the glacial melt doesn’t arrive until summer. To spare farmers a barren yield, engineer Sonam Wangchuk has invented a way to bring the glaciers to the people.

In 2015, with $125,000 raised on a crowdfunding site, Wangchuk built a 64-foot-tall “ice stupa”—an artificial glacier made by piping mountain streams into a Ladakhi village. The water spouts geyser-like from a vertical pipe, freezing into a cone of ice shaped like a Buddhist shrine. It’s designed to stay frozen until the spring sun warms the fields.

Sure enough, Wangchuk’s prototype began to melt in April, watering a field of newly planted poplar trees. By June, when the regular glacial melt began to flow, the ice stupa was mostly gone.

Now Wangchuk is laying a pipeline to build 50 more ice stupas. Each will supply 10 million liters of water a year and irrigate 25 acres of land. This story appears in the April 2017 issue of National Geographic magazine.

There's a frozen labyrinth atop Mount Rainier.

These caverns—the largest glaciovolcanic caves in the world—sit more than 14,000 feet above sea level. Along with the altitude, invisible pockets of lethal gases and razor-sharp rocks make these caves an inhospitable place to be, let alone to conduct research.

This icy labyrinth in the glaciers atop Mount Rainer, which towers to the southeast of Seattle, Washington, contains clues about the volcano, the inner workings of glaciers, and even icy worlds far from Earth. The caves can be awe-inspiring, but for caver and National Geographic Explorer Christian Stenner, the joy is only felt once he and the rest of the expedition team are safe and sound.

“It was amazing to set foot in it for the first time,” Stenner says. The main passage of the caves is a large ring around the volcanic crater, but entrances to the system are narrow and cramped, branching up and out from the main ring. Explorers must crouch as they make their way down from entrance holes at the glacier’s surface, crawling along the steep crater to the main ring nearly 500 feet below. “It takes a minute to orient yourself to what you’re about to do, and then you just get to work,” Stenner says.

Despite the constant hazards that have devastated coral reefs around the world, some coral communities have still managed to recover and persevere. In a study released Monday, researchers identify 38 coral “oases” that have escaped, resisted, or rebounded from the threats facing these vital marine ecosystems.

An Underdog Story

The future has often been bleak for coral reefs. Plastic pollution and overfishing threaten marine ecosystems. As climate change causes the ocean’s temperature to climb, coral reefs undergo mass bleaching events, losing the algae that they rely on for energy. Warmer waters also mean that coral-eating sea stars survive longer, lay more eggs, and cause more damage. There may be hope for coral reefs.

The results are delicious.,"This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.

VALLE DE GUADALUPE, BAJA CALIFORNIA, MEXICO — At first glance, the neat rows of wiry grapevines planted in a pinwheel at the Viñas del Tigre vineyard in Baja California don't seem remarkable. But to Aldo Quesada, the grower and winemaker, the rows are a map to the future.

On one side of the pinwheel, tempranillo, merlot, granache, and other classic wine grapes look withered and anemic. Over the past few years they have been baked by unprecedented heat waves and parched by record-breaking drought—the brutal new normal climate conditions here at the southernmost tip of North America’s wine-growing range.

But one row looks different. Quesada's misión grapes, descendants of the first grape varietal carried to North America by Spanish missionaries 500 years ago (and called ""mission"" in English), are not just surviving but thriving. Lush, palm-sized leaves flutter in the salty sea breeze. Grapes left on the vine after the recent harvest are still plump and sweet.  This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.

He and his companion stood outside the entrance, watching basketball-sized rocks rain down from the unstable ice cliff overhead. After gathering his wits, he sprinted inside—followed a moment later by Douglas Benn, a veteran Himalayan Glaciologist from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland."
These cities are sinking into the ground,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/these-cities-are-sinking-into-the-ground,06-15-2023,Human activity and natural forces can cause parts of the Earth’s surface to sink. These cities are facing a double whammy: sinking land and rising seas.,"New York City is, slowly but surely, sinking into the Atlantic Ocean. Researchers recently showed that the city creeps .04 to .08 inches toward sea level every year. Combined with rising sea levels and intensifying storms, this could raise the risk of devastating floods.

While “most of the headlines are saying the skyscrapers are the problem, they really aren’t,” says Tom Parsons of the United States Geological Survey, who led the new study.

Though parts of the city are built over artificial land (made by filling water with sediment), most of the Big Apple’s heaviest skyscrapers are built on sturdy bedrock; the city’s slow shoreward slump has far more to do with geology than hefty construction. Sinking aside, the sea is actually rising faster in New York City than the land is falling, Parsons adds. New York City is, slowly but surely, sinking into the Atlantic Ocean.

We’re a two-hour drive northeast of Seattle, and we’re far from any defined trails. After a day and a half of hiking, fording creeks, thrashing through tight forest, and climbing chutes, this rocky rise is all that separates us from our destination: the shrinking Columbia Glacier.The North Cascades, the most remote portion of this mountain range, is the most glaciated region in the Lower 48. Pelto’s been making this trek every year since 1982, when he began an ambitious 50-year project to track the behavior of these glaciers. Their ice is a crucial lifeblood of this region: During the warm months of June through September, they release 25 percent of the region’s total water supply—approximately 230 billion gallons each year—which is fully utilized for power, drinking water, agriculture, and some of the last healthy wild salmon runs on the planet. The glaciers also play a significant role in reflecting sunlight regionally and mitigating climate change.

But they’re rapidly disappearing—and the accelerating disappearance of mountain glaciers worldwide has become one of the most visible and unsettling signs of global warming. The loss of glacial ice not only hastens sea-level rise, it has reduced fresh water supplies relied on by millions of people who live in the valleys below. Mountain glaciers have lost ice at a faster pace in the last 10 years than in the previous decade, according to an analysis of NASA satellite data published in Nature in April. The scientists who studied the data concluded that by mid-century, parts of mountain ranges around the world, including the Cascades and Rocky Mountains, are on track to be ice free. On a hot August afternoon, glaciologist Mauri Pelto picks his way across a steep slope of fragmented rock deep in Washington State’s Cascade Mountains. We’re a two-hour drive northeast of Seattle, and we’re far from any defined trails. After a day and a half of hiking, fording creeks, thrashing through tight forest, and climbing chutes, this rocky rise is all that separates us from our destination: the shrinking Columbia Glacier.The North Cascades, the most remote portion of this mountain range, is the most glaciated region in the Lower 48. Pelto’s been making this trek every year since 1982, when he began an ambitious 50-year project to track the behavior of these glaciers. Their ice is a crucial lifeblood of this region: During the warm months of June through September, they release 25 percent of the region’s total water supply—approximately 230 billion gallons each year—which is fully utilized for power, drinking water, agriculture, and some of the last healthy wild salmon runs on the planet. The glaciers also play a significant role in reflecting sunlight regionally and mitigating climate change.

U.S. emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide are rising again, posing a potential challenge to President Barack Obama’s climate pledge.In 2014, energy-related carbon emissions increased  for the second consecutive year, although by a smaller amount than in 2013, according to a report Monday by the U.S. Energy Information Administration or EIA.The uptick, after a few years of decline, suggests the United States could have a difficult time meeting its emissions target. Last month, ahead of historic climate talks in Paris, Obama pledged to reduce total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent, from 2005 levels, by 2025. The bulk (80 percent) of that total is energy-related carbon emissions, the remainder coming from other gases such as methane.

This Glacier Just Spit Out An Iceberg the Size Of Lower Manhattan,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/glacier-ice-collapse-greenland,07-11-2018,The Helheim Glacier in Greenland just lost 10 billion tons of ice--and scientists captured it on camera.,"A chunk of ice the size of lower Manhattan—four miles wide, a mile across, and half a mile thick—broke off of the Helheim Glacier in Greenland and tumbled into the sea a few weeks ago.

When ice that was previously sitting on land, like this piece of the glacier, falls into the ocean and melts, the ocean gets a little fuller. In other words, sea levels rise. (See what the world would look like if all the ice melted.)

This particular chunk of glacier—about 10 billion tons of ice, enough to give every American more than 600 10-pound bags of ice—won't have a noticeable effect on the waves that lap at the beaches in Sydney, Cape Cod, or Honolulu. But when you add up this plus all the other pieces that slough off from both Greenland and West Antarctica each year, the effect adds up: about a millimeter a year, or a few inches over the past 25 years. And the ice sheets shed faster and faster each year.

Where’s the Ice?

Ice sheets, like those in Greenland and Antarctica, lock up about two percent of all the water that exists on the world’s surface (most of the rest, unsurprisingly, is in the ocean). Greenland spits about 270 billion tons of ice into the ocean each year—more when it's warmer and a little less during cool years. Antarctica currently dumps about 100 billion tons each year, but that number is very likely to increase fast in coming decades.

This Heartbreaking Photo Reveals a Troubling Reality,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/article/seahorse-ocean-pollution,09-19-2017,Photographer Justin Hofman's image of a seahorse swimming with a discarded cotton swab illustrates the issues of pollution in our oceans.,"Justin Hofman was leading an expedition through Borneo when a small group broke off for some impromptu snorkeling near the town of Sumbawa Besar. “The reef was actually in surprisingly good shape. It was devoid of big fish though the corals were thriving,"" Hofman says. ""After about an hour or so of bobbing around the tide started to turn. My good friend and expert wildlife spotter Richard White found this tiny sea horse drifting near the surface.”

Seahorses ride the ocean currents by grasping floating objects with their tails. What began as amusement watching the tiny fish grasping bits of sea grass coming in with the tide turned to anger as plastic and other unnatural debris began to overtake the scene. Although a rising wind splashed polluted water in his snorkel and caused both camera and seahorse to bob around, Hofman stayed with it, capturing this image along with several others.

They planted one piece at the base of a coconut tree about 30 feet from the shore and offered the other to the sea. Throughout his childhood, Kitara returned to the tree to check on its health and brush away any fallen fronds. Even as a kid, though, Kitara recognized that the shoreline was inching closer to his umbilical cord. The sea is getting hungrier and hungrier, he thought. 

Tuvalu is an island nation of less than 12,000 inhabitants, located halfway between Hawaii and Australia. The country’s average elevation is less than 10 feet above sea level, which makes it particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. Scientists estimate that by 2050, 50 percent of Funafuti, the capital where more than half of the country lives, will become flooded by tidal waters. 

Many see Tuvalu as an example of what other coastal communities will face in the years to come. Researchers predict that, by 2050, more than 216 million people may be forced to migrate due to climate change. Tuvalu’s precarious position has forced it to reckon with an existential question: What happens to a country if it no longer has land?  TUVALU — When Taukiei Kitara was born, his parents cut his umbilical cord into two pieces, as is tradition in his native country of Tuvalu.

The world is watching. Since most of its electricity comes from fossil fuels, proponents say carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology like Boundary Dam's could be critical in heading off the worst effects of climate change. Can the $1.1 billion Canadian project prove them right?

The results so far are promising, but by no means final. Boundary Dam extracts 90 percent of the carbon from its smokestacks, then injects it into nearby oil wells to goose output. So far, it has captured 400,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to its operator, SaskPower. On a chilly, open plain in Saskatchewan, clean coal is getting its first big trial.

The reserve became the sixth-largest of its kind in the world—while the island of Palau is smaller than New York City, its marine protected area became larger than the state of California.

In a statement made at the time, Palau's President Tommy Remengesau, Jr., said the move was essential to conserving the island's livelihood: ""Island communities have been among the hardest hit by the threats facing the ocean.

He was this middle-class guy born and raised in Lakewood, Colorado, grew up a bit of a tinkerer. He was always taking apart his mom’s appliances and conducting little experiments in his bedroom. During a thunderstorm he’d run a line out to a power pole outside to see if he could conduct a little bit of the charge to a light bulb. Or he’d tune the radio during storms and listen for the static crashes of far-off lightning. He was fascinated by storms.

But the charismatic rabbit-relative is integral to the high-alpine landscapes of the American West. Hikers above the tree line often see the diminutive creatures busily dashing around slopes of rocky debris called taluses. If they don’t see them, they likely hear their high-pitched calls.

“They look like little dumplings, but they’re actually really industrious, hard-working animals,” says Alex Wells, the community science coordinator at the Denver Zoo and co-director of the Colorado Pika Project, a partnership between the zoo and Rocky Mountain Wild, a Denver-based nonprofit. The project’s mission is to document and collect key information about pikas and their habitat, and to use that information to better understand how climate change could be threatening the survival of certain pika populations. Because pikas are so physiologically fine-tuned to their way of life and talus habitats, they’re especially vulnerable to the effects of a warming climate, making them an indicator for the advancement of climate change.

In 2010, pikas were considered for federal endangered species protection, but the Fish and Wildlife Service rejected the petition—in part because researchers didn’t have enough data about them across their full range. “So we are really looking to fill that gap for the southern Rockies, for Colorado,” Wells says.

While many scientists believe the impact of El Niño cycles are increasingly exacerbated by climate change, archaeological evidence shows the climate phenomenon has been severely affecting life in the region for more than a thousand years, with past societies battling its effects with practical on-the-ground engineering as well as spiritual appeals to the gods—appeals that have included acts of ritual child sacrifice unprecedented in world history.

And it's not the only fungus taking advantage.","Anne Pringle was surveying mushrooms at a field site in Tomales Bay State Park, just north of San Francisco, when she found herself in a predicament. She was surrounded by a sea of one of the world’s most dangerous mushrooms: Amanita phalloides, commonly known as the death cap.

“I couldn’t put my foot down without stepping on them,” Pringle says. “It was just a valley of death. A total infestation.”

That was 20 years ago, when Pringle, now a mycologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, was doing research at the University of California, Berkeley. Despite its proliferation, there was a rumor that the deadly mushroom hadn’t originated on the Golden Coast. Six years and much DNA sequencing later, Pringle proved the rumor true: North America’s death cap mushroom was an invader, a fungal species likely native to Europe.

(Death cap mushrooms are extremely deadly—and they’re spreading.)

Now found thousands of miles outside that original range, death caps are the culprit behind most mushroom-related poisonings. Their powerful toxins start to attack the human body in as little as six hours after they’re consumed, causing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting that, if untreated, can result in fatal liver failure. Last August three people in Australia died from ingesting death caps, victims of an alleged poisoning. The mushroom—about five inches tall with a greenish yellow-white cap—can be easily mistaken as edible. In British Columbia, a child died after eating one in 2016; in Northern California, 14 people fell severely ill in 10 separate incidents during one particularly scary week in 2017.

When a fungus is moved anywhere from dozens to thousands of miles away, these complex relationships can go haywire.

But death caps didn’t evolve to kill people. These mushrooms are mycorrhizal fungi. They spring from a tangle of fungal threads that grow in soil and curl around tree roots, helping the trees take up nutrients. This activity underfoot both intrigues and worries scientists, like Pringle, who say we know too little about the fungal kingdom and what happens when these underground networks are rewired.

Over the past century, our world has become more connected than ever, and fungi, like the death cap, have embarked on countless global journeys, hitching a ride on imported plants or simply wafting hundreds of miles in the wind. Now climate change is allowing many of these organisms to thrive in ecosystems that were once too cold and dry. If history is any indication, we may not be ready for what’s in store. Anne Pringle was surveying mushrooms at a field site in Tomales Bay State Park, just north of San Francisco, when she found herself in a predicament. She was surrounded by a sea of one of the world’s most dangerous mushrooms: Amanita phalloides, commonly known as the death cap.

“I couldn’t put my foot down without stepping on them,” Pringle says. “It was just a valley of death. A total infestation.”

That was 20 years ago, when Pringle, now a mycologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, was doing research at the University of California, Berkeley. Despite its proliferation, there was a rumor that the deadly mushroom hadn’t originated on the Golden Coast. Six years and much DNA sequencing later, Pringle proved the rumor true: North America’s death cap mushroom was an invader, a fungal species likely native to Europe.

This destructive fishing style doesn't just harm marine life,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/climate-change-bottom-trawling-fishing,01-18-2024,"Bottom trawling is banned in over half of U.S. federal waters, and produces harmful emissions that are warming the planet.","Bottom trawling, or the use of heavy nets to scrape the ocean floor for fish, has a detrimental effect on sea life and marine ecosystems. Despite that, the practice still provides over a quarter of fishery catches worldwide. 

Now, a landmark new study published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science has found that bottom trawling is responsible for feeding up to 370 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, making the practice destructive for both ocean life and the climate.

Bottom trawling occurring between 1996 and 2020 contributed 0.97 parts per million to atmospheric CO2, according to the paper. If it continues as is, the authors predict it will add an additional 0.2-0.5ppm of CO2 by 2030. For context, the growth rate of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere currently increases on average by about 2.4ppm per year, according to the 2023 Global Carbon Budget report.

This ferocious water flea is mauling the Great Lakes,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/invasive-water-fleas-decimating-plankton-in-great-lakes,12-02-2020,"A tiny invasive species, the spiny water flea, is decimating plankton in the lakes, rattling an ecosystem that supports valuable fisheries.","DULUTH, MINNESOTA — On a mild September morning on the aft deck of the research vessel Blue Heron, Donn Branstrator sniffed the contents of a sampling bottle that some graduate students had just hauled up from the depths of Lake Superior. “That’s why fish smell the way they do,” said Branstrator, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota in Duluth. The fishy odor came from planktonic crustaceans just a few millimeters long, a primary food source for all the fish in the lake.

The most important are Daphnia—a genus that comprises some 100 freshwater species. These tiny animals are critical to lake health: Besides providing food for fish, they graze on floating algae, beating their legs constantly to create microcurrents that pull the algae toward their miniature maws. By keeping algae in check, Daphnia help keep the system in balance.

But Daphnia are declining in Lake Superior and nearly every other body of water in the Great Lakes region. Their numbers have been decimated by a fierce invasive predator, the spiny water flea.

But oily microbes may finally offer a sustainable alternative.","Palm oil is the world’s most popular vegetable oil, found in half of all supermarket goods and seven out of every 10 personal care products. It’s what gives tortilla chips their crunch, detergents their cleaning power, and toothpaste its smoothness. It’s also used as a biofuel. Since 2016, global palm oil consumption has risen 73 percent.

Yet palm oil, and the unabating appetite for it, is problematic. The clearing of forests to make way for oil palm plantations is a major driver of deforestation in the tropics: Between 1972 and 2015, the world’s two largest palm oil producing nations, Indonesia and Malaysia, lost 16 percent and 47 percent of their forests, respectively, to the crop. Deforestation is linked to a host of environmental problems, such as climate change, soil fertility issues, and poor water quality, among others. Biodiversity suffers a severe blow too, with studies estimating that mammal diversity declines by up to 90 percent when forests are slashed to plant oil palms.

Much of that was to make room for ranching, but other commercial activities like mining and soy production were also involved. Forest loss was down overall from the previous year by nearly 50 percent, largely due to massive wildfires in 2016 and 2017. But without wildfires, forest loss was up by roughly 13 percent. That has implications for climate change as well as other environmental concerns, the researchers note.

In addition to providing habitat for animals and other plants, forests are also a critical tool to fight climate change. Large swaths of forest like the Amazon rainforest are carbon sinks, helping suck excess carbon emissions from the atmosphere. Because of human activities the world continued to lose forests in 2018, according to data compiled by research group Global Forest Watch and analysts at the University of Maryland.Clear cutting—removing large patches of forest indiscriminately—caused the highest loss of forest cover overall. Much of that was to make room for ranching, but other commercial activities like mining and soy production were also involved. Forest loss was down overall from the previous year by nearly 50 percent, largely due to massive wildfires in 2016 and 2017. But without wildfires, forest loss was up by roughly 13 percent. That has implications for climate change as well as other environmental concerns, the researchers note.

The utility hadn’t erred. Air-conditioning accounts for about a quarter of Arizonans’ energy use, more than four times the national average. And it’s not a luxury. Without air conditioning, summer heat in Phoenix can be fatal. Last year, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-related deaths—a record for the county. “We've had the highest number we've ever seen several years in a row,” says Sunenshine. The county is currently on track to exceed last year’s toll.

Extreme temperatures haven’t been confined to the Southwest. June was the hottest month ever recorded in North America. Early in July, an unprecedented heat wave claimed nearly 200 lives in Oregon and Washington, and another 600 people or more are thought to have died in British Columbia from the heat.

As the sun flared, she picked the pods and placed them in the fold of her yellow dress, knowing these beans are part of an agricultural revival that could feed hundreds of families in her desert-dwelling community.

In the past, this simple crop fed many more families in the Guajira desert. The Wayuu, descendants of the indigenous Arawak, live scattered across this dry territory in small communities called rancherias. For centuries, they survived the harsh environmental conditions by herding goats, harvesting wild fruits, and cultivating the brown-patterned cowpeas now dubbed after the Spanish name for their home, guajiro beans.

This legacy remained strong up until the turn of the 21st century, when prolonged droughts hit Colombia’s northern region, brought on by global warming and unprecedented oscillations of El Niño, a cyclic climate pattern in the Pacific Ocean. In 2011, the construction of El Cercado dam for the sake of coal exploitation dried the Rancheria river, which has historically provided water to the Wayuu. (Both coal mining and coal plants rely on abundant amounts of water to function). Afterward, many in the community abandoned farming, turning to governmental support in the form of food stamps that rarely arrived.

This single number could reshape our climate future,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/this-single-number-could-reshape-our-climate-future,01-28-2021,"The social cost of carbon is the “single most important number that nobody has ever heard of.” In the U.S., it’s about to get much higher.","In the flurry of actions that President Joe Biden has taken to respond to climate change—rejoining the Paris Agreement, canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, pausing oil and gas leases, directing the government to purchase only zero-emissions vehicles—one move has gotten less attention but may be critical for the future of life on Earth. It concerns a number most people have never heard of.

On January 20, his first day in office, Biden ordered an immediate review and revision of the “social cost of carbon,” a wonky economics metric that represents how much each additional ton of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere costs society. First calculated by the Obama Administration, the number was slashed under former President Donald Trump. That made it easier for his Environmental Protection Agency to justify rolling back major climate regulations, including Obama-era fuel economy standards and the Clean Power Plan.

Experts say that revising the value assigned to the social cost of carbon to once again be in line with science will allow the Biden Administration to craft stricter greenhouse gas regulations across myriad sectors of the economy and ultimately help meet its climate policy goals.

This summer could change our understanding of extreme heat,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/this-summer-could-change-our-understanding-of-extreme-heat,07-20-2021,The record-smashing Pacific Northwest heat wave suggests that climate change has forced us past a threshold for temperatures.,"The heat wave that scorched the Pacific Northwestern United States in late June rewrote the record books in ways that were both shocking and difficult to comprehend. Scientists are unsure how best to explain the temperatures, so extreme compared with what meteorologists expect to see in that typically cool, wet region of the world.

In Seattle, Washington, temperatures hit 108 degrees Fahrenheit, 9 degrees hotter than it’s ever been in steamy Tampa, Florida. Portland, Oregon’s 116°F eclipsed Dallas, Texas’s heat record by 3 degrees. Hundreds of miles north of Portland, the British Columbia village of Lytton set a new temperature record for Canada—a Death Valley-like 121 degrees. The next day, the town was engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire.

It’s possible the Pacific Northwest simply experienced a very unlucky combination of weather and climate change. But in recent days, some researchers have begun to consider an alternative explanation: Perhaps climate change has set in motion new, as yet poorly understood, processes that are making heat waves that once seemed statistically impossible far more likely.

The two-inch critters have speckled brown bodies that blend in with the forest floor, and they can dart off in the blink of an eye.

But for such a tiny reptile, it faces some large threats: notably, urban development in one of the fastest growing U.S. states and sea level rise due to climate change.

In May, Florida’s wildlife agency decided to move forward with plans to list the reef gecko as threatened, three years after scientists warned that its historic range has dwindled—and what remains is at high risk of going underwater by the end of the century.

These geckos have already disappeared completely from nine spots, and their habitat has been reduced to 41 percent of its original size in less than a century, according to recent research. At the same time, South Florida’s stretch of the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to rise between one and three feet by 2080, according to NOAA.

This toad’s sex life hinges on finding the perfect pool,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/yosemite-toad-sex-life-and-survival-threatened-by-climate-change,04-15-2019,"The Yosemite toad will mate and lay eggs only in certain sorts of pools. As climate change alters the pools, this endangered species is even more at risk.","This story appears in the May 2019 issue of National Geographic magazine.

The male Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus canorus) can mate like mad every year—for about two weeks. Only in late spring. And only in wet meadows, at elevations above 4,800 feet, in California’s Sierra Nevada. The male will wait in a pool, trilling. A female drawn by his mating call (canorus means “melodious”) will enter the water and submit to his advances—if the pool suits. Toads have precise specifications for where they’ll breed and leave their eggs, says U.S. Forest Service ecologist Christina Liang.

For six years Liang and colleagues observed 143 pools across 19 meadows in the toads’ range. Toads seek pools that will support life from the springtime when eggs are laid through late summer when toadlets emerge. By tracking which pools were and were not occupied, researchers found differences in conditions were at times quite small. Toads chose wider pools with more surface area; pools with warmer water (a mean temperature of 76.7°F versus 71.2°F); and pools that were deeper—by only about the diameter of a standard pencil.

To mate, Liang says, the male “clamps onto” the female’s back—but “she has the final say” on where to release eggs and may move around with him attached until she chooses a spot. Once she releases her eggs and he fertilizes them, she’ll leave; he’ll resume calling.

The Yosemite toad is considered endangered, and its numbers are falling. Scientists say the amphibian chytrid fungus is one reason, but climate change also may contribute to some pools drying up before tadpoles mature. The species “is on that knife’s edge,” Liang says, “where these really small changes in environmental conditions can have potentially large effects.” This story appears in the May 2019 issue of National Geographic magazine.

It was when the body of a long-dead friend surfaced near her front door that Bulu Haldar knew her house was as good as gone.

For weeks, the embankment shielding East Dhangmari, in the Khulna district of southwestern Bangladesh, had been threatening to sink into the Pusur River. First, a ferocious storm had ripped into the outer layer of concrete. Then, at the end of 2017, the river had begun eating into the porous earthen wall itself. Locals rushed in sandbags, but that bought only a few days’ respite. When the river finally surged into the cemetery across from Haldar’s garden, disinterring skeletons and contaminating the village’s drinking pools, it filled her one-room hut waist-deep in muddy brown water.

“There was nothing else I could do to protect my house,” she said. “We were powerless, like children.”

Ghoramara Island, India, on the western edge of the Sundarbans mangrove forest, has been robbed of its protective mangroves by tree cutting and sea-level rise and is eroding steadily. Nitya Gopal lost his home.

Haldar, a meticulously dressed widow of about 50, had at least had some inkling of what was to come. She’d watched as the nearby Sundarbans, a vast mangrove forest that flanks the village, had retreated, its trees looking increasingly weedy. She’d noted how the water appeared to draw strength from the forest’s weakness. The only surprise, Haldar insisted, is that the village’s earthworks held out for so long. “The trees defended us, but we treated them very badly,” she said. “So now we are all suffering the consequences.”

In Bangladesh and the neighboring Indian state of West Bengal, there are thousands of villages like East Dhangmari—places that are losing their natural defenses against climate change just as it is intensifying. The land is paper-flat and crisscrossed by rivers bulging with meltwater from the Himalaya. Cyclones frequently roar in off the Bay of Bengal, sometimes killing thousands. Flooding is pervasive. This story appears in the July 2019 issue of National Geographic magazine.

It was when the body of a long-dead friend surfaced near her front door that Bulu Haldar knew her house was as good as gone.

For weeks, the embankment shielding East Dhangmari, in the Khulna district of southwestern Bangladesh, had been threatening to sink into the Pusur River. First, a ferocious storm had ripped into the outer layer of concrete. Then, at the end of 2017, the river had begun eating into the porous earthen wall itself. Locals rushed in sandbags, but that bought only a few days’ respite. When the river finally surged into the cemetery across from Haldar’s garden, disinterring skeletons and contaminating the village’s drinking pools, it filled her one-room hut waist-deep in muddy brown water.

“There was nothing else I could do to protect my house,” she said. “We were powerless, like children.”

Ghoramara Island, India, on the western edge of the Sundarbans mangrove forest, has been robbed of its protective mangroves by tree cutting and sea-level rise and is eroding steadily. Nitya Gopal lost his home.

This visionary inspired Amazon conservation—and a new Nat Geo expedition,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/perpetual-planet-this-visionary-inspired-amazon-conservation-and-a-new-nat-geo-expedition,04-12-2022,National Geographic and Rolex have announced a new plan to explore the Amazon Basin. It owes a great intellectual debt to one man: Tom Lovejoy.,"This article was supported by Rolex, which is partnering with the National Geographic Society on science-based expeditions to explore, study, and document change in the planet's most unique regions.

Last week the National Geographic Society announced that its highest honor, the Hubbard Medal, will be awarded posthumously to Thomas E. Lovejoy, the American ecologist and visionary conservationist who long labored for the protection of the Amazon forest. It’s a fitting recognition of Lovejoy, who died at 80 on December 25, 2021. He was, among his many roles and honors, a National Geographic Explorer at Large and a longtime advisor to the Society. His commitment to saving the Amazon resonates in the books he left behind, the people he inspired—and in a program called the Perpetual Planet Amazon Expedition, which the Society is launching today in partnership with Rolex.

The Amazon is the world’s largest rainforest, encompassing 1.4 billion acres of terra firma forest, seasonal wetlands, meandering rivers and tributaries, and perhaps 10 percent of Earth’s biological diversity. Thanks to prodigious rainfall, it carries 20 percent of the planet’s river water from the Andes to the Atlantic, and its vegetation delivers seven trillion gallons daily back into the sky, by transpiration from leaves. The new NGS-Rolex program will address aspects of this vast living complex by way of a series of scientific studies, funded for two years (as a start) and carried out by National Geographic Explorers from the region. The fieldwork begins today.

The program grew from a proposal by National Geographic Explorer and photographer Thomas Peschak to conduct a comprehensive photographic survey of the river, from the Andes to the sea, that would focus on the aquatic underworld rather than the more visible forest. The Society embraced Peschak’s storytelling vision and decided to pair it with scientific research. Peschak helped select the scientists and their projects.  This article was supported by Rolex, which is partnering with the National Geographic Society on science-based expeditions to explore, study, and document change in the planet's most unique regions.

No major oil companies bid on any tracts. Two small companies—one energy, one real estate—were awarded leases on two tracts, and the Alaska Industrial Development Corporation, the state's own industrial recruiter, spent $4.4 million to acquire leases on nine tracts. A total of around 600,000 acres were sold. The $1.8 billion in estimated revenue was 125 times more than the federal government received.The end of one of the greatest environmental battles in modern American history is near—and it could go either way.On one side is the oil-friendly Trump Administration and the state of Alaska, which, along with a few native corporations on the North Slope, are heavily dependent on oil tax revenue. On the other are nearly all the major national environmental organizations, the Gwich’in people of Alaska and Canada, and, according to recent polls, the majority of Americans. At stake is nothing less than the crown jewel of American wilderness.

Chinese manufacturing has changed the economics of renewable power around the world, making solar generation cost-competitive with electricity from fossil fuels like natural gas and even coal. It has brought change closer to home too, as China rolls out the world’s biggest investment in clean energy—motivated in part by a desire to ease the atrocious air pollution that kills an estimated 1.1 million of its people every year.

The 34-year-old wasn’t there to admire 18th-century paintings alongside New York City’s summer tourists; with red marker on her hands and black tape on her mouth, she was there to disrupt. 

Smith is part of a growing climate activist movement whose protests center art and museums. Since at least May 2022, environmentalists with groups like Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion have been using cake, soup, paint, and glue to capture the attention of museum visitors—by marking the glass protecting art pieces and attaching themselves to the frame or wall surrounding them. Each time, their message is simple: there is no art on a dead planet. 

But these climate activists say they have no interest in damaging art. Instead, they want to raise awareness about the climate emergency and attract new members. By at least one measure, their approach is working: Smith became involved with the New York City chapter of Extinction Rebellion only after protesters began focusing on museums. She had marched peacefully in defense of Black lives and women’s rights, but she had never put her body on the line—not until Extinction Rebellion.  When Georgia B.

Tangier Island is a squiggle of mud and marsh in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay, which is about 30 miles wide at that point, and a dozen miles from the nearest mainland port, Crisfield, Maryland. It is home to roughly 460 people, all of them descended from the first settler on the island, a guy named Joseph Crocket, who moved there in 1778. Though it’s only 100 miles from Washington, D.C., it’s among the most isolated communities in the East. The island’s isolation has spawned a style of speech that you’ll not hear anywhere else in America. Few of us could find Tangier Island on a map.

It looked like the illness, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, might be moving across the country in pig feed—but that had never happened with a virus before. For an expert in swine nutrition, it was an intriguing case. Jason Woodworth, at the time a new faculty member at Kansas State University, scrambled to put together a team and get to the bottom of it. But once he had the veterinarians, virologists, and diagnostic experts he needed, he confronted another problem: There was no money available to support rapid-response research.

“Quick action isn’t possible through the typical federally funded channels, because it takes so long to put together applications,” he tells The Plate. He located some funding from the National Pork Board instead. With that backing, he and the team confirmed that imported grains had arrived contaminated with the virus—and developed a new process that killed the pathogen with heat.

The view out the window was bad enough. As his research plane flew over groves of California’s giant sequoias, some of the world’s tallest trees, Greg Asner could see the toll the state’s four-year drought had taken. “It looked wicked dry down there,” he said. But when he turned from the window to the video display in his flying lab, the view was even more alarming. In places, the forest was bright red. “It was showing shocking levels of stress,” he said.

The digital images were coming from a new 3-D scanning system that Asner, an ecologist with the Carnegie Institution for Science, had just installed in his turboprop aircraft. The scanner’s twin lasers pinged the trees, picking out individual branches from 7,000 feet up. Its twin imaging spectrometers, one built by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), recorded hundreds of wavelengths of reflected sunlight, from the visible to the infrared, revealing detailed chemical signatures that identified each tree by species and even showed how much water it had absorbed—a key indicator of health. “It was like getting a blood test of the whole forest,” Asner said. The way he had chosen the display colors that day, trees starved of water were bright red. This story appears in the November 2015 issue of National Geographic magazine.

It might have been Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Jimmy Kimmel, or any of the other sharp-tongued talk show hosts of late-night TV. In this instance, it was Samantha Bee, on her program Full Frontal, doing a stand-up routine about opposition to childhood vaccinations. “The anti-vax movement has been spreading faster than Legionnaires’ disease at the Playboy Mansion,” Bee declared, barely pausing for audience laughter. Claims that these vaccines are harmful rest on shoddy science, she said; the vaccines have been deemed safe by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Who are you going to believe?” she asked. “Leading authorities on medical science, or 800 memes on your cousin’s Facebook page?”

Joking about science can have serious effects, according to studies by communication scholars, us among them. Since 2013, Paul has conducted three studies of how satire can influence people’s beliefs about issues such as climate change, genetically modified foods, and vaccinations. We worked together on two of these studies, and with other colleagues Jessica recently tested whether late-night television can debunk misperceptions of vaccines. Our and others’ research has shown that if you want to interest people in science and shape their views on hot-button science issues, satirical humor can work better than a straitlaced approach.

We completed our research before the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, but many of the insights might apply to satire addressing public health issues during the pandemic. And some of the comedians we mention—including John Oliver, Trevor Noah, and Samantha Bee—have featured a steady stream of coronavirus-related satire on their programs.

Many Americans pay little attention to science. Even people who regularly watch broadcast television news or cable news channels receive only scraps of science information in their media diet, because mainstream outlets devote so little airtime to the subject. On top of that, some Americans may regard science as intimidating and hard to understand, so they avoid the topic altogether.

Yet satirical humor can reach viewers who would never watch NOVA or read—well, National Geographic. Millions of people watch late-night television programs live, and videos of these shows get tens of millions of views on streaming services or YouTube. In 2016, when Paul, his colleague Barbara Ley, and the University of Delaware Center for Political Communication polled a nationally representative sample of Americans, nearly one in 10 said they learned about science from late-night television shows such as The Late Show and Last Week Tonight. This figure was even higher among young people. This story appears in the June 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.

That was an ironic twist of fate, since the expansion of ski resorts is one of the threats to the survival of the remaining 2,000-3,000 possums found on just a few Australian mountains today.

Another problem creeping up on the possums (as well as the skiers) is climate change, which freezes some possums in their hibernating burrows as reduced snow cover from warming increases the animals’ exposure to icy winter winds. Increased drought, meanwhile, is causing catastrophic declines in fat-rich bogong moths, one of the mountain pygmy possum’s favorite foods—though they are also very fond of the bright red fruits and tough seeds of the mountain plum pine.

Those challenges put the critically endangered possums at risk of extinction, says paleontologist Michael Archer of the University of New South Wales. “Two consecutive years of reduced snowfall could eliminate this animal from the world,” he says.

Too hot to live: Millions worldwide will face unbearable temperatures,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/too-hot-to-live-millions-worldwide-will-face-unbearable-temperatures-feature,06-17-2021,A warming climate is likely to push entire regions out of their comfort zones—and make staying cool a matter of survival.,"The human body has evolved to shed heat in two main ways: Blood vessels swell, carrying heat to the skin so it can radiate away, and sweat erupts onto the skin, cooling it by evaporation. When those mechanisms fail, we die. It sounds straightforward; it’s actually a complex, cascading collapse.

As a heatstroke victim’s internal temperature rises, the heart and lungs work ever harder to keep dilated vessels full. A point comes when the heart cannot keep up. Blood pressure drops, inducing dizziness, stumbling, and the slurring of speech. Salt levels decline and muscles cramp. Confused, even delirious, many victims don’t realize they need immediate help. 

With blood rushing to overheated skin, organs receive less flow, triggering a range of reactions that break down cells. Some victims succumb with an internal temperature of just 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius); others can withstand 107 degrees for several hours. The prognosis is usually worse for the very young and for the elderly. Even healthy older people are at a distinct disadvantage: Sweat glands shrink with age, and many common medications dull the senses. Victims often don’t feel thirsty enough to drink. Sweating stops being an option, because the body has no moisture left to spare. Instead, sometimes it shivers.  The human body has evolved to shed heat in two main ways: Blood vessels swell, carrying heat to the skin so it can radiate away, and sweat erupts onto the skin, cooling it by evaporation.

Travelers are starting to help with coral replanting around the globe,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/how-travelers-can-help-revive-ailing-coral-reefs,02-06-2020,Here's how the programs work—and what to know before you join in.,"This story appears in the March 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Beautiful and fragile, coral reefs in tropical oceans worldwide are threatened by climate change, storms, and bleaching. Now travelers can help restore them by supporting coral replanting programs.

National Geographic Explorer Paola Rodríguez-Troncoso has worked on a Mexican program that sustainably replanted more than 6,000 coral fragments over six years. In this project, divers collect fragments from the ocean floor that have been knocked off reefs by storms or waves. Then they tether healthy pieces to the substrata of reefs at the same or nearby sites. It’s a process that can vary by location. For example, in some areas where reefs border lagoons, such as French Polynesia, the coral fragments are placed in underwater nurseries to recuperate before replanting.

Coral Gardeners founder Titouan Bernicot drills holes into a dead part of the reef to insert living coral fragments.

Resorts and conservation groups are starting to educate and involve visitors in these efforts. To avoid programs that may do more harm than good, Rodríguez-Troncoso cautions against any that purposely break off fragments from healthy corals or fail to get the required permits. Though replanted fragments grow slowly, each one can be part of a reef’s centuries-long life span. “That small seed,” Rodríguez-Troncoso says, “that will really help.” This story appears in the March 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Years earlier, he wrote, he’d cut down some cottonwood trees and “observed the formation of bubbles in the sap upon the freshly cut trunk, stump and chips.” When he struck a match, the gas ignited in a blue flame. At the university, he replicated the flame test on a campus cottonwood and this time captured gas samples.

That’s the finding of a new study published today by researchers at Queen Mary University of London, England, in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. “Trophy” animals tend to be the most evolutionarily fit and possess the high-quality genes a population of animals need to adapt quickly to a changing environment, says evolutionary ecologist and lead author Robert Knell. “They also father a high proportion of the offspring. But if they’re killed before they can spread their ‘good genes’ around, this reduces the overall fitness and resilience of that population.”

When environmental conditions change—a shift in seasonal rainfall or warmer temperatures—the risk of extinction increases dramatically, even with a healthy population of animals apparently unaffected by trophy hunting, Knell says.

Despite efforts to reduce tropical deforestation, tree cover loss has nearly doubled over the past 15 years. In 2017, 39 million acres (15.8 million hectares) disappeared — an area close to the size of Washington State — according to new data released Wednesday by the research group World Resources Institute (WRI) at the Oslo Tropical Forest Forum, where 500 forest experts and policymakers are meeting about the issue. The latest total was second only to 2016, the worst-ever year of tropical forest loss with 41.7 million acres (16.9 million hectares).

Trump's Offshore Drilling Plan—What You Need to Know,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/trump-administration-announces-offshore-drilling-plans-spd,01-04-2018,A new federal plan would expose 90 percent of coastal waters to oil drilling efforts. Here's what that means.,"On January 4, the Trump administration unveiled a five-year blueprint to expand offshore drilling and gas leasing in nearly all U.S. waters. The plan, which would span 2019 to 2024, would also let the government auction off permanently protected areas. (Read a running list of how the Trump administration is changing the environment.)

""We want to grow our nation's offshore energy industry, instead of slowly surrendering it to foreign shores,"" Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke says in a statement.

The Plan

The proposed plan would expand offshore drilling to more than 90 percent of waters in the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Arctic. According to the Interior Department, more than 3 billion barrels of oil and 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas lie off the outer continental shelf.

"Tundra threats, explained",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/tundra-threats,06-19-2019,Climate-driven changes in these harsh lands at the ends of the Earth could have a worldwide impact.,"Tundras are among the world's coldest, harshest biomes, with extreme temperatures and low rainfall. But these environments in the Arctic and on mountains are far from invulnerable, displaying sensitivity to human disruptions and climate change.

Home to animals including Arctic foxes, polar bears, gray wolves, caribou, snow geese, and musk oxen, the Arctic tundra is changing in broad and somewhat unpredictable ways as global average temperatures rise. Its underlying base of frozen soil and plant matter, called permafrost, is thawing. That is turning the tundra into a source of greenhouse gas emissions, as soil microbes convert carbon into carbon dioxide and methane. The tundra is also slow to repair itself from physical disturbances such as tire tracks from heavy vehicles.

Threats to tundras

Climate change. A warmer climate could radically change tundra landscapes and what species are able to live in them. Warming creates potential feedback loops that encourage further destabilization of tundra ecosystems. The release of methane from deteriorating permafrost, for example, feeds the thawing cycle, while higher temperatures drive the growth of shrubs, which can change soil temperature and prevent snow from reflecting out heat.

But is it politically feasible?","In an effort to address the threat of climate change, a group of conservative U.S. statesmen has outlined a plan that, by 2030, could cut the United States’s carbon emissions by up to two-fifths below 2005 levels.

At a Wednesday press conference, the newly established “Climate Leadership Council”— a consortium of Republican Party stalwarts including officials from the Reagan and both Bush administrations—unveiled their plan for a gradually increasing, revenue-neutral tax that puts a price on carbon dioxide emissions.

The Climate Leadership Council’s proposal calls for a $40 tax on each metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions, with the tax steadily increasing on an annual basis. All proceeds—an estimated $200 to $300 billion per year—would be distributed back to American citizens in the form of dividend checks. Carbon taxes on foreign imports and rebates for U.S. exports would then keep U.S.-made goods competitive, the authors claim.

In the race to build the battery of the future, they’re unveiling a unique option. They say their flow battery is the first made with cheap, non-toxic, non-corrosive, non-flammable, high-performance materials.

“It is a huge step forward. It opens this up for anyone to use,” says Michael Aziz,  Harvard University engineering professor and co-author of a study published Thursday in the journal Science. Because the battery is safe and non-corrosive, he says, it’s well suited for both businesses and homes, adding: “This is chemistry I’d be happy to put in my basement.” If you dream of an off-grid house powered by the sun, plan on a battery to store energy for cloudy days—ideally, one that won’t catch fire.

Now, for the first time, new research reveals that a coral’s chance of surviving in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef depends on whether it encounters “practice runs” of gently warm water.

Climate change, however, is posed to eliminate these pulses of warmth, exposing the Great Barrier Reef—a necklace of 2,900 individual reefs strung along Australia’s northeast coast—to high temperatures with a lesser chance of preconditioning.

The effects could be devastating. If greenhouse gases continue at the current pace, the reef’s corals could be bleached to death by the 2050s. The reef is home to more than 1,500 species of fish, six of the world’s seven marine turtle species, and 30 species of whales and dolphins. What’s more, the UNESCO World Heritage site is a tourism powerhouse, supporting about 70,000 jobs and pumping more than six billion dollars into the Australian economy.

The United States faces extreme cold due to Winter Storm Grayson, a bomb cyclone slated to hit the East Coast this January. The powerful low-pressure system could resemble a winter hurricane and bring near-blizzard conditions, coastal flooding, and even power outages.

ABOUT WEATHER BOMBS

A ""bomb cyclone"" is the unofficial yet increasingly popular name for when a storm strengthens quickly as a result of a drop in pressure. The lower the pressure, the stronger the storm, creating one massive bomb system.

It's caused by ""explosive cyclogenesis,"" a process in which a low-pressure storm falls 24 millibars—a unit of pressure—over a 24-hour period. This can happen when cold and warm air masses collide. The central air in the system rises quickly and the pressure of the warm, wetter air plummets. LATEST NEWS

While natural hazards like extreme rainfall and heat waves are becoming more frequent and severe as the planet heats up, our scientific understanding of those hazards, and the early warning systems that safeguard communities, have improved significantly over recent decades. As a result, disasters related to weather and climate have become less deadly over time.

There’s no guarantee, however, that this positive trend will continue forever.

Climate, scientists have long explained, is what you get when you mash together day after week after month after year of weather. Climate is the whole cloth woven together by individual threads of daily weather.

For years, scientists have cautioned that weather can’t tell us about how the climate is changing. That 70-degree day in January? There are a whole pile of reasons that could have happened.

Welcome to the polar bear capital of the world: ‘It’s kind of epic’,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/polar-bear-capital-of-the-world-hudson-bay-churchill,12-22-2022,"In Churchill, Canada, polar bears gather by the hundreds in the fall, waiting for the nearby bay to freeze. The human residents live prepared for the unexpected.","CHURCHILL, CANADA — On a cold November morning in the subarctic Canadian town of Churchill, Manitoba, Ian Van Nest sits in the warmth of his SUV and peers through binoculars at a pair of polar bears wandering along the icy shoreline. They are far enough away to not raise particular concern but every one of their large strides is bringing them closer to the community, and Van Nest knows that he might soon have to do something about it.

Van Nest is Churchill’s conservation officer, and for several weeks each year, keeping polar bears and people away from each other is his primary occupation. That’s because Churchill, a town of roughly 800 year-round residents on the shores of western Hudson Bay, is the polar bear capital of the world.

Polar bears are creatures of the sea ice and they spend as much of their time on it as possible, covering vast distances in search of seals. But because the ice of Hudson Bay melts completely each summer, the region’s bears must spend the warm months ashore, sheltering in cool, earthen dens. Then, when winter approaches and the temperatures drop, the bears begin to stir, heading toward the tundra along the bay shores as they wait for the water to freeze. And when they do, their path often takes them around—or through—Churchill.

Were you on team orca? Why we wanted nature to 'fight back' in 2023,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/orcas-javelinas-sea-otters-nature-climate-change,12-21-2023,The internet cheered this year for animals that seemed to rebel against humans. This enthusiasm tells the story of a unique cultural moment.,"If 2020 was the year that nature “healed,” 2023 was the year, supposedly, of nature’s revenge: orcas sinking yachts, javelinas destroying golf courses, and one feisty sea otter stealing surfboards. As the popular narrative goes, animals have had enough—and they are (finally!) revolting against human domination.

Of course, it’s not true. These critters are doing normal animal things that just happen to antagonize humans. Javelinas, pig-like creatures native to the U.S. Southwest, destroyed a golf course in Sedona, Arizona, because they were rooting for earthworms. Orcas in the Strait of Gibraltar were likely messing around with rudders for fun. And Otter 841, the adult female who repeatedly pestered kayakers and surfers in Santa Cruz, California, may have associated people with food.

When humans see these acts as intentional, we are also engaging in a behavior that’s typical for our species—telling stories that, while not literally accurate, capture some larger truth. For instance, as climate change makes life on Earth increasingly difficult and unpredictable, it may seem as if nature is “fighting back.”

As a result, the longstanding belief that we humans reign supreme over nature, and that our needs trump those of all other animals, seems to be shifting, says Geoffrey Whitehall, a political science professor at Acadia University in Canada.

“We usually reserve agency for humans,” Whitehall says. “But animals clearly have interests that are different from our own, and when we recognize that, when we start to believe that other animals matter, it opens up a lot of interesting conversations.” If 2020 was the year that nature “healed,” 2023 was the year, supposedly, of nature’s revenge: orcas sinking yachts, javelinas destroying golf courses, and one feisty sea otter stealing surfboards.

Their collapse could send sea levels up by at least a foot by 2100—and potentially much more.

For years, scientists have watched and learned that those glaciers are crumbling and melting, the rate speeding up over the decades and imperiling the stability of the entire ice sheet. But while the science was clear that human influences on climate would affect the ice down the line, it has been hard to tell whether human-driven global warming has affected the melting already underway.

Now, a team has unraveled evidence of that human influence. In a study published Monday in Nature Geoscience, a team of scientists showed that over the past century, human-driven global warming has changed the character of the winds that blow over the ocean near some of the most fragile glaciers in West Antarctica. Sometimes, those winds have weakened or reversed, which in turn causes changes in the ocean water that laps up against the ice in a way that caused the glaciers to melt.

My brother, Ethan, was working the harvest on Fisher Vineyards in Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, and was ordered to evacuate that morning, along with more than 50,000 other people. As he left, he said, the sky was red and he could smell smoke through his face mask. “It was insane, and terrifying,” he told me.This year’s wine country wildfires haven’t reached the size of infernos from past years, but they are growing and still threaten to swallow many homes and workplaces. Perhaps those most affected by the raging fires are the region’s seasonal agricultural workers. Many are Hispanic, being paid hourly wages, and they may find themselves without jobs or homes if these blazes continue. As thousands flee the smoke, making their way toward evacuation centers and houses of nearby acquaintances, there is a lot of uncertainty in the air. Anxiety, too. “This sucks,” Ethan told me while driving away from the vineyard, heading for our cousin’s house in Los Angeles. “This really, really sucks.” Early in the morning on September 28, while it was still dark, white ash floated down over parts of Sonoma and Napa counties in Northern California.

We’re concerned about the Great Lakes—and you should be too,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/concerns-about-the-great-lakes-and-why-you-should-share-them,11-17-2020,"A native of the Great Lakes State, National Geographic’s editor contends that protection of the freshwater source is key to the planet’s survival.","This story appears in the December 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.

I grew up in the Great Lakes State, and for many years now, during my annual summer (yes, it has to be summer) visit back to Michigan, I’m always happy about what I don’t see. I don’t see throngs of Californians (sorry) swarming adorable lakeside towns like Petoskey or Glen Arbor. I don’t see hordes of New Yorkers (sorry) splashing about Lake Michigan or thundering down the steep white sands of Sleeping Bear Dunes.

No offense to the multitudes on both coasts, but I’ve always been glad the still-unspoiled charms of northwest Michigan felt like my secret—or at least a secret held by a smaller group of people, largely from the Midwest.

Lately, however, I’ve been thinking about the downside of being out of sight and out of mind.

Most people seldom think about Lakes Michigan, Huron, Superior, Erie, and Ontario. Many can’t even name all five. But they should care about them because, as Tim Folger writes in this month’s cover story, the Great Lakes are “arguably the continent’s most precious resource, incalculably more valuable than oil, gas, or coal.”

Together the lakes hold more than 20 percent of the surface freshwater on Earth and 84 percent of the surface freshwater in North America. Almost 40 million Americans and Canadians “drink from the lakes, fish on them, transport goods over them, farm their shores, and work in cities that wouldn’t exist” without them, Folger writes. This story appears in the December 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.

I grew up in the Great Lakes State, and for many years now, during my annual summer (yes, it has to be summer) visit back to Michigan, I’m always happy about what I don’t see. I don’t see throngs of Californians (sorry) swarming adorable lakeside towns like Petoskey or Glen Arbor. I don’t see hordes of New Yorkers (sorry) splashing about Lake Michigan or thundering down the steep white sands of Sleeping Bear Dunes.

We’re losing monarchs fast—here’s why,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/monarch-butterflies-risk-extinction-climate-change,12-21-2018,"It’s not too late to save them, but it’s a question of whether we make the effort, scientists say.","The epic 3,000-mile monarch butterfly migration may become a thing of the past. Each fall, monarchs travel from their summer homes in the northern U.S. and Canada to winter habitats in California and Mexico. But the 2018 Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count found that the number of west-coast monarchs spending the winter in California had plunged to only 20,456 butterflies—a drop of 86 percent since last year. And the number of eastern monarchs overwintering in Mexico this year has dropped 15 percent since last year, for a total decline of more than 80 percent over the past 20 years, according to the National Wildlife Federation.

This year’s count is only the latest in a string of bad news for the charismatic butterfly that makes one of the longest known insect migrations. The culprit? Humans. The twin forces of human-caused climate change and habitat loss are now threatening North American monarch butterflies with extinction.

Increasing carbon dioxide levels may be making milkweed—the only food monarch caterpillars will eat—too toxic for the monarchs to tolerate. And higher temperatures may also be driving summer breeding areas further north. That means the monarchs’ migration routes will get longer and therefore more difficult.

Whale meat helped polar bears survive past warming,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/polar-bears-eat-whale-meat-climate-change-sea-ice-loss,10-09-2018,But chowing on whale carcasses today won't prevent an extinction crisis. Only saving sea ice will.,"The risks to polar bears on our rapidly warming planet is clear: Ursus maritimus treks across Arctic sea ice, which it uses as a platform to hunt fatty seals, typically ringed seals. But climate change is freezing Arctic Ocean sea ice later and melting it sooner.

In all but two of the Arctic's 19 polar bear subpopulations, sea ice cover dropped 7 to 19 days per decade from 1979 to 2014. In the Beaufort Sea region, where sea ice now lasts roughly 36 days a year less than it did in the 1990s, scientists found bears spent 31 more days on land—far from their ice-dependent prey. With less sea ice, some bears are growing smaller, having fewer cubs, and not living as long.

Scientists have long predicted that threat will get worse as sea ice continues its stark decline. That's why polar bears are protected under the Endangered Species Act.

Whales eat three times more than previously thought,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/whales-eat-three-times-more-than-thought,11-03-2021,"The blue whale, the world's largest animal, can consume up to 16 tons of plankton daily, which has major implications for ocean health.","It began with a straightforward question: How much do baleen whales eat?

Because baleen whales—humpback whales, right whales, blue whales, and others—mostly feed hundreds of feet deep, we can’t easily observe their behaviors. And it would be neither desirable nor possible to try to answer the question by keeping such huge animals (blue whales, up to a hundred feet long, are the largest on Earth) in captivity to monitor their daily eating patterns. What’s more, some species eat voraciously for several months, then fast for the rest of the year, which further complicates tracking their food intake.

“This is such a basic question, I'd assumed we'd figured it out 30, 40, 50 years ago, but no one had ever measured it,” says Matthew Savoca, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station, in California, and a National Geographic Explorer.

Those questions are being hotly debated by the world’s climate scientists as global leaders prepare for the UN climate talks in Paris at the end of this month. Now, a new study by a team of NASA climate scientists has sparked controversy by reporting that “Antarctica is actually gaining ice.”

Scientists concluded in the Journal of Glaciology that the loss of glacier mass in Antarctica’s western region is being offset by thickening of glaciers on the continent’s eastern interior, which has experienced increased snowfall. The result: A net gain of about 100 billion tons of ice per year, according to the report. Are the Antarctic’s ice sheets shrinking or growing? And what does that mean for global sea-level rise?

Hurricane Florence’s torrential rainfall has brought catastrophic flooding to much of North and South Carolina, but the convergence of several unexpected factors as the storm was about to touch land kept the hurricane from pounding the coast with devastating winds exceeding 130 miles per hour.Instead, Hurricane Florence’s peak winds were around 90 mph when it made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina September 14. But the storm’s agonizingly slow movement at two or three mph—a person could have walked inland about as fast as Florence moved—allowed it to dump unprecedented rainfall and gave it plenty of time to push a storm surge of about 11 feet up the Cape Fear River and into downtown Wilmington.Meteorologists say the overall forecasting for Hurricane Florence was very accurate. But the inability to forecast the storm’s last-minute weakening underscores the extreme difficulty of predicting what a massive engine of wind and water is going to do at any given moment. It’s a problem that’s been a puzzlement for as long as people have been looking at the ocean’s horizon and wondering what’s coming.

Hurricane Florence’s torrential rainfall has brought catastrophic flooding to much of North and South Carolina, but the convergence of several unexpected factors as the storm was about to touch land kept the hurricane from pounding the coast with devastating winds exceeding 130 miles per hour.Instead, Hurricane Florence’s peak winds were around 90 mph when it made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina September 14. But the storm’s agonizingly slow movement at two or three mph—a person could have walked inland about as fast as Florence moved—allowed it to dump unprecedented rainfall and gave it plenty of time to push a storm surge of about 11 feet up the Cape Fear River and into downtown Wilmington.Meteorologists say the overall forecasting for Hurricane Florence was very accurate. But the inability to forecast the storm’s last-minute weakening underscores the extreme difficulty of predicting what a massive engine of wind and water is going to do at any given moment. It’s a problem that’s been a puzzlement for as long as people have been looking at the ocean’s horizon and wondering what’s coming."

It was so uncharacteristically warm that scientists, emerging from their tents high on the peak of the ice sheet, sank up to their knees in the suddenly soft snow. And then, that snow started melting.

Near the edge of the ice sheet, bright blue puddles collected on the flat white surface. Rivulets of melt trickled down, braiding into fat, gushing rivers. The meltwater punched through gullies and spilled down crevasses. One river near the edge of the ice sheet was so swollen that it swept away a bridge that had been there for decades. So much water spilled out of the guts of the ice sheet that year that global sea levels rose by over a millimeter.

What a Simple Psychological Test Reveals About Climate Change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/embark-essay-tragedy-of-the-commons-greed-common-good,05-24-2018,"If everyone’s success depended on it, would you share—or be selfish?","This story appears in the June 2018 issue of National Geographic magazine.

I teach undergraduate psychology courses at the University of Maryland, and my classes draw students with diverse interests. But every one of them perks up when I pose this question: Do you want two extra-credit points on your term paper, or six points?

I tell my students that the extra-credit offer is part of an exercise illustrating the interconnectedness of choices individuals make in communities. I explain that the exercise was inspired by an ecologist named Garrett Hardin and an address that he delivered 50 years ago this summer, describing what he called “the tragedy of the commons.” Hardin said that when many individuals act in their own self-interest without regard for society, the effects can be catastrophic. Hardin used the 19th-century convention of “the commons”—a cattle-grazing pasture that villagers shared—to warn against the overexploitation of communal resources.

Garrett Hardin defined ‘the tragedy of the commons’ as many individuals acting in their own self-interest without regard for society. The effects can be catastrophic.

I’m hoping that my students will grasp the connections between the classroom exercise, Hardin’s ideas, and our planet’s most pressing problems (including climate change). I allow them to choose between two points or six points of extra credit—but there’s a catch. I stipulate that if more than 10 percent of the class members choose six points, no one gets any points. The extra-credit points are analogous to water, fuel, grazing pasture (from Hardin’s analysis), or any natural resource.

According to some free market economic theories, if everyone strives for maximum personal benefit, then societies will thrive. By this logic the student’s rational choice would be to pick six points, just as the shepherd’s rational choice would be to use as much grazing pasture as possible. And those who maximize personal consumption aren’t greedy—they’re strategic.

But when everyone chooses this path, the common resource is overtaxed, and societies end up with overharvesting, water shortages, or climate change. This story appears in the June 2018 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Surrounded by an arid landscape of dry scrub grasses and salt-crusted soils, it’s hard to believe the village was once along the banks of a swollen river, 30 miles from the shore of the world’s fourth-largest lake. Over the last 50 years, that lake, the Aral Sea, has dried up almost entirely, in what is often called the “world’s worst environmental disaster.” Now, it’s hard to farm much of anything in Karauzyak—except for atriplex, or saltbush.

They’ve fed it to cows at a nearby farm and found that it helps lock scarce moisture into the thirsty soil, and it can be grown without extensive fertilizer use.

As she holds up a dusty green twig of atriplex, Kristina Toderich, a halophyte expert from Tottori University in Japan, explains why the salt-loving plant excites scientists like her: “This doesn’t need water.

What does a melting glacier sound like?

In tidewater glaciers—large rivers of ice that pour into the sea—the steady melting of ice underwater causes billions of these bubbles to burst into the water “like little tiny gunshots,” says Erin Pettit, a glaciologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, who is part of the team that made the discovery.

That violent pop of air stirs up the cold layer of water that hugs the surface of the glacial ice—bringing warmer water, several inches away, into contact with it. The bubbles then rise buoyantly through the water—driving turbulent currents that also bring warm water into contact with the ice.

What fuel made from the sun could do for the planet,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/solar-fuel-sustainable-energy,06-20-2024,A new facility in Germany is making liquid fuel out of sunlight. Here’s how it works.,"This week, in a field outside Dusseldorf, Germany, an acre full of mirrors will begin concentrating sunlight on a 66-foot-tall tower. If all goes according to plan, the result will be the first major step toward harnessing the power of the sun to create sustainable, carbon-neutral fuel to power long-haul flights and even some industrial processes that presently require fossil fuels.

The DAWN Project has been developed by Swiss company Synhelion to begin industrial-scale production of so-called “solar fuels,” which the company argues have the potential to significantly reduce planet warming carbon emissions.

The process is different from the more familiar use of sunlight in green energy: photovoltaic cells that capture the sun’s rays and convert them directly to electricity. In contrast, the Synhelion approach is to harness the power of the sun to create liquid fuels that can “drop in” to existing technology and function just as existing fuels do, without the need for any retrofitting, adaptation, or infrastructure changes.

That’s roughly the size of Sweden’s economy, and it makes the United States government the single biggest consumer in the world.

In his January 27 executive order aimed at tackling the climate crisis, President Joe Biden encouraged federal agencies to become more environmentally conscious consumers. Experts say making government “purchasing power” greener can act as a catalyst for sustainable businesses, giving climate-conscious producers consistent demand from a powerful customer.

How does it work? 

When the federal government spends money strategically, it can act as a powerful market leader, driving change across entire industries. Such purchasing power largely plays out in the form of contracts for which private companies compete—in this case, in the green sector.

This “Conference of the Parties”—COP—comes at a critical practical and symbolic moment, a year after it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The urgency to act is as clear as ever,” says Rachel Cleetus, a climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It is unconscionable to not deliver.” Intense, world-changing weather events—extreme floods, enormous wildfires, huge hurricanes, and unprecedented heat waves—are driving home a sobering reality: Climate change is here and already affecting many people around the globe.

Against that stark backdrop, world leaders and climate negotiators will gather at the climate-focused COP26 meeting in Glasgow, Scotland for two weeks starting on October 31.

The goal was to determine the impact of American bison and cattle on the ecosystem, compared with plots of similar prairie protected from these grazers. 

It’s hot, tedious, and tick-infested work, but it is incredibly important: Tallgrass prairies used to cover a huge portion of Texas and stretch all the way up to southern Canada. Today this habitat, dominated by head- and waist-high grasses and forbs, herbaceous flowering plants, is imperiled. Tallgrass prairie is now present in just four percent of its former North American range.

Now, decades of diligence and data show a perhaps surprising result: When bison were allowed to graze through patches of tallgrass prairie, they boosted native plant species richness by a whopping 86 percent over the past three decades, according to a study published August 29 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Setting an ""ambitious"" goal, the White House is aiming for a 40 to 45 percent cut from 2012 levels in the next ten years.

Releases of heat-trapping methane, the main component of natural gas, are rife in the booming oil and gas industry. Leaky equipment and the intentional flaring of ""waste"" gas at oil sites have been a side effect of the breakneck production that has made the U.S. the world's largest gas producer. The new target, according to the White House, will save enough natural gas in 2025 to heat more than two million homes for a year.

The U.S. proposal comes in advance of another round of United Nations-led climate talks later this year in Paris that aim to finalize a new global accord to slow global warming.

That was before the city state—de facto culture capital of the United Arab Emirates—found oil, leveraged its oil, then realized the oil wouldn’t be sustainable, so it diversified its economy into tourism and real estate.

But the cornerstone of Dubai’s economy isn’t oil, it’s logistics: getting people and materials into a city that not long ago was just overheated expanse of desert."

The Harvard-educated investment banker, 69, co-chairs the Risky Business Project, which aims to quantify the risks that climate change poses for key economic sectors in the United States.

You’ve likened the climate crisis to a financial crisis. How do the two compare?

Excesses of debt created the financial crisis; excess of CO₂ created the climate crisis. These are coupled with flawed government policies and incentives and pervasive, outsize risktaking. The difference is that last-minute government action averted economic Armageddon during the financial crisis. We don’t have that option with climate change.

What’s the economic risk in doing nothing?

If we don’t act, the risks will compound, and we’ll lose the opportunity to avoid the worst outcomes. Businesses need to factor the threats from climate change into their investment decisions and to urge local and national policy actions. When climate-related disasters strike, we all pay. We urgently need policies such as carbon pricing to incentivize behavior change and promote clean technologies. Henry M.

"Why Half a Degree Matters: Higher Seas, Longer Heat Waves, Dead Reefs",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/210416-climate-warming-degree-seas-reefs,04-21-2016,New research suggests that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees can dramatically reduce the impacts of climate change around the world.,"Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius could dramatically curb water scarcity in the Mediterranean region, help save tropical reefs, allow more wheat to grow in West Africa, and significantly shorten heat waves, according to a new study by European researchers.

As global leaders have wrangled over how to prevent warming the planet more than 2 degrees, leaders in vulnerable Pacific Island and West African nations have argued that this goal was too lax. Last December, climate negotiators meeting in Paris agreed that the world should seek to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, although that goal would be tough to reach and the benefits were difficult to quantify. On Friday, heads of states of about 160 nations will sign the climate agreement.

Koalas, which normally spend most of their time in the safety of eucalyptus trees, have begun to climb down and drink from artificial water stations provided by University of Sydney researchers. The koalas of Gunnedah, a town in southeastern Australia often referred to as the “Koala Capital of the World,” were drinking from the stations for more than 10 minutes on average, according to a press release from the university.

Koalas are leaving their trees even when they would normally be asleep, according to university researchers. The animals can sleep up to 18 hours a day in trees, and their primary diet consists of eucalyptus leaves, which they often eat at night. They can eat up to two and a half pounds of leaves per day.

Why Trump Can't Make Coal Great Again,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/why-trump-can-t-make-coal-great-again,03-28-2017,Long-term market forces will keep miners from getting their jobs back. But Trump could slow the decline of coal—and the rise of renewables.,"This story was updated on March 28, 2017, based on an executive order expected from President Donald Trump aimed at rolling back Obama-era climate policy, including the Clean Power Plan, restrictions on methane emissions, and other initiatives.

Shortly after 9:30 in the morning on April 29, 2016, a loud boom thundered through western Colorado’s North Fork Valley. Near the top of the narrow valley, a 14-story-high concrete coal silo sagged, then crumpled to the ground, seeming to dissolve into clouds of black and gray smoke. For decades, the coal mine that filled the silo had employed most of the people in the surrounding town, but in recent years activity at the mine had slowed and, finally, stopped, leaving a skeleton crew of just four. In 10 minutes, the silo demolition confirmed what many had long feared: The Oxbow Mine and its well-paying jobs had left the valley for good.

I lived in the North Fork Valley for 15 years, and in the late 2000s, when cheap natural gas hit the domestic coal market, I saw—and in some cases felt—the local effects. Hundreds of miners lost their jobs, as did many who depended on their business. Families were uprooted, and some rural schools lost so many students that they struggled to stay open. The hardship was real, and the fear and anger were, too.

On May 4, less than a week after the Oxbow coal silo was blasted into rubble and grit, Donald Trump held a campaign rally at the Charleston Civic Center in West Virginia. He put on a hard hat, pantomimed shoveling coal, and praised miners’ courage and dedication. “If I win, we’re going to bring those miners back,” he told his audience. “These ridiculous rules and regulations that make it impossible for you to compete—so we’re going to take all that off the table, folks.” During the general election campaign this summer, Trump repeatedly told supporters that he would “end the war on coal.” His listeners cheered, and their enthusiasm helped tip the swing states of Pennsylvania and Ohio toward Trump.

This could have devastating effects: Kids need to be exposed to the microbes in the soil to build up their defenses against diseases that may attack them later. But it’s not just children, Paul Bogard explains in his new book, The Ground Beneath Us. The EPA estimates that the average American adult now spends 93 percent of their life indoors. As we retreat indoors, more and more of the earth is disappearing, with an estimated quarter of a million acres paved or repaved in the United States each year. [Find out why we are wired to be outside.]

When National Geographic caught up with Bogard by phone at his home in Minnesota, the author explained why Iowa is the most transformed state in the U.S., how soil is alive but we’re killing it, and how places where terrible things happened can become sacred ground.

You write, “We are only just now beginning to understand the vast life in the soil, what it does, and how our activities on the surface may affect it.” Talk us through some highlights of the new science—and how you became so passionate about dirt.

It began with this statistic: that those of us in the Western world now spend about 90-95 percent of our time inside, in our houses, work places, in our cars. We’re living our lives separated from the natural world. When we walk outside, many of us walk on pavement. There’s this literal separation from the natural ground, from the soil, the dirt. It made me think, what are the costs of this separation? And it struck me as symbolic of our separation of these many different kinds of grounds that sustain us. Our food, water, energy, even our spirits come from these different grounds. It’s estimated that children now spend less time outside than the average prisoner.

It also contains chemicals that emit greenhouse gases.

New fridges will likely be greener. In a switchover that will be largely invisible to consumers, more fridges and air conditioners are entering the U.S. market that will do less harm to the planet.

This week, the U.S. government took a step to expedite that rollout. As part of President Barack Obama's climate plan and ahead of global climate talks, the Environmental Protection Agency approved five less-polluting chemicals or refrigerants, one of which is flammable propane.

Why a Quiet Hurricane Season Isn't Necessarily a Good Thing,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/news-atlantic-hurricane-season-rainfall-climate-change,08-02-2018,"A warming Arctic may cause storms to track farther west, increasing odds of landfall.","Forecasters at Colorado State University say the approaching peak of the 2018 hurricane season will be relatively quiet in the Atlantic Basin. But a report released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration pointed out a troubling trend that could have implications for future hurricane forecasting: Warming in the Arctic could drive future Atlantic hurricane tracks farther west and thus make a U.S. landfall more likely.

The CSU forecasters, headed by meteorologist Phil Klotzbach, think cooler waters and drier air in the Atlantic Basin—which includes the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea—along with the presence of upper-level winds known as wind shear will make it more difficult for storms to form.

Hurricanes draw their power from warm ocean waters, and warm, moist air helps sustain them. The storms that spawn hurricanes are less likely to intensify when they are deprived of fuel and face hostile atmospheric conditions, thus suggesting the 2018 season is expected to be relatively quiet.

Steadily rising average temperatures fuel increasingly intense wildfires, hurricanes, and other disasters that are now impossible to ignore. And while the world has been plunged into a deadly pandemic, scientists are sounding the alarm once more that climate change is still the greatest threat to human health in recorded history.

On September 5, more than 200 medical journals released an unprecedented joint editorial that urged world leaders to act. “The science is unequivocal,” they write. “A global increase of 1.5°C above the pre-industrial average and the continued loss of biodiversity risk catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse.” People around the world are witnessing firsthand how climate change can wreak havoc on the planet.

Yet the mass destruction of trees—deforestation—continues, sacrificing the long-term benefits of standing trees for short-term gain of fuel, and materials for manufacturing and construction.

We need trees for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that they absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale and the heat-trapping greenhouse gases that human activities emit. As those gases enter the atmosphere, global warming increases, a trend scientists now prefer to call climate change.

There is also the imminent danger of disease caused by deforestation. An estimated 60 percent of emerging infectious diseases come from animals, and a major cause of viruses’ jump from wildlife to humans is habitat loss, often through deforestation.

    California has some of the most ambitious climate goals in the United States—it’s aiming for net-zero emissions by 2045, five years earlier than the federal goals—and boasts some of the strongest environmental protection rules in the country. Yet California is still a fossil fuel powerhouse, and oil spills are not a new phenomenon along the coast. Despite its green reputation, counting offshore and onshore drilling, California is the seventh largest source of fossil fuels in the country.While the state has said it will begin to wind down some of its extraction operations, existing oil extraction, production, and refining will continue to endanger coastline wildlife and human health if there not significant efforts to slow further drilling, says Charles Lester, director of the Ocean and Coastal Policy Center in the Marine Science Institute at University of California, Santa Barbara. An underwater pipeline leaking off Southern California for several days has blanketed miles of the coast in sticky oil. Already, the crude has infiltrated a critical coastal wetland habitat in Huntington Beach and is making its way south as winds and waves disperse the toxic goo.

Why is an ocean current critical to world weather losing steam? Scientists search the Arctic for answers.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/why-ocean-current-critical-to-world-weather-losing-steam-arctic,12-02-2019,A conveyor belt of ocean water that loops the planet and regulates global temperatures could be heading for a tipping point.,"THE HIGH ARCTIC, ABOARD THE R.V. KRONPRINS HAAKON — Summer sea ice has been shrinking so dramatically here in the Fram Strait, high in the Arctic between Norway and Greenland, that researchers who make this trip annually point out missing patches like memories of departed friends.

“The first time I was here, in 2008, you could walk on the ice,” says Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) oceanographer Paul Dodd, gesturing from the deck of this research icebreaker toward the spot, near the Prime Meridian, where his team is about to take samples for temperature, salinity, dissolved carbon, and other chemical measurements of what is now open water.

Dear NOAA-20:

I know you don’t have a catchy name like Voyager or Cassini, but I appreciate you all the same. Unlike your extrovert cousins, you are an introvert—inward-looking, focused on just one planet. But it’s an important one, the only planet we know of so far in the universe that is home to life: Earth.

As you orbit over the Poles, your role is to measure the “energy balance” that governs Earth’s temperature. With one eye looking down, you measure the outgoing heat escaping from the surface and atmosphere. With the other eye looking up, you measure the incoming solar radiation that heats Earth from above. Subtracting the former from the latter, you estimate the net heating of the planetary system.

Orange, blue, and sparkling-silver fish dart around a seascape of vibrant greens, yellows, pinks, reds, purples, and countless combinations of the full rainbow of color. There are few places on our planet as otherworldly and intensely colorful as a healthy coral reef.

Such a paradise takes time to create. Coral grows very slowly—some species grow less than an inch a year—so a coral reef can take thousands of years to fully develop. But it’s worth it. “Coral reefs are the most biodiverse marine systems,” says Professor David Smith, Director of the Coral Reef Research Unit at the University of Essex and Chief Marine Scientist for Mars, Inc. “They pack 25 percent of all marine life into less than one percent of the ocean floor.” A single reef can be home to thousands of species, acting as a nursery for fish and a natural sea defense for coastlines. “Coral reefs support the livelihoods of millions of people, and are directly connected to several other key marine ecosystems,” adds Smith.

It’s a fitting reminder this month as we mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

Two scenarios emerge.

On the magazine cover, there’s a verdant Earth. Welcome to the optimistic view of writer Emma Marris, who sees a world that is changed—we cannot undo some damage we have done—but one in which technologies will be harnessed to “feed a larger population, provide energy for all, begin to reverse climate change, and prevent most extinctions,” Marris writes. “The public desire for action is bursting forth on the streets ... Just as in 1970, the electric crackle of cultural change is once again in the air. I believe we will build a good 2070.”

Unchecked climate change will hit Africa especially hard.

Next, turn the magazine over, to the side with the browner Earth. Elizabeth Kolbert looks to a new normal of “sunny-day flooding,” when high tide will send water gushing across low-lying U.S. coastal cities, and most atolls will be uninhabitable. This is the world of longer droughts, deadlier heat waves, fiercer storms, and more. “I could go on and on listing the dangerous impacts of climate change,” Kolbert writes, “but then you might stop reading.” She sees no evidence that we will address those and other threats fast enough to keep them from overwhelming us and the natural world.

It’s impossible to know who is right. The stories in this issue reflect divergent realities. When I read about the young people taking charge of the environmental movement, I feel buoyed. Then I see Pete Muller’s photos of a scarred landscape we will never get back. What I do know is that it is our job to provide a factual framework for what is happening, documentary photography about what is forever changed and what we can save, and information to help empower all of us to make a difference.

Why we need to give air pollution the sustained attention it deserves,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/editor-why-we-need-to-give-air-pollution-the-sustained-attention-it-deserves,03-16-2021,"It’s a killer of millions, and it’s worst where the most vulnerable people live. But air pollution can be cut drastically when we demand regulation and enforcement.","This story appears in the April 2021 issue of National Geographic magazine.

It’s hard to imagine places more different from one another than Delhi, India; Mexico City, Mexico; and Gary, Indiana. Yet years after I visited those cities, they’re indelibly linked in my memory for one reason: the foul, polluted air smothering their landscapes. The pollution was so heavy you could see it wafting through the interiors of modern buildings (Delhi, 2016), feel it stinging your eyes (Mexico City, 1972), and smell it through closed car windows (Gary, the 1960s).

Despite its ubiquity, or perhaps because of it, air pollution has rarely gotten the sustained attention it deserves. That’s an outrage, given that air pollution is a global killer, causing an astonishing seven million premature deaths every year. But it’s also an opportunity, because this is an environmental problem that we can fix. 

There’s no better example of that than the experience of the United States, which last year celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Clean Air Act. Signed by President Richard Nixon on December 31, 1970, this single statute resulted in a 77 percent decrease in the nation’s air pollution. It lengthened millions of American lives, saved trillions of dollars, and according to the American Lung Association’s Paul Billings, became “the most powerful public health law enacted in the 20th century.” 

Those of us of a certain age can vividly recall its impact. Think of Los Angeles 50 years ago, or Pittsburgh, or so many other locales where the horizon was a haze and grime settled on your car overnight. The Clean Air Act has been “the difference maker,” in Billings’s words—leaving many U.S. communities’ air quality “so much better than it was, and so much better than it is in other parts of the world.”

Still, the problem is far from solved, as pollution expert Beth Gardiner and photographer Matthieu Paley found in reporting this month’s cover story. Air pollution disproportionately harms the poor and people of color who live where it’s worst. And after four years of a U.S. administration that gutted regulations, the Clean Air Act “has survived, but it has been damaged,” says environmentalist Mustafa Santiago Ali. This story appears in the April 2021 issue of National Geographic magazine.

It’s hard to imagine places more different from one another than Delhi, India; Mexico City, Mexico; and Gary, Indiana. Yet years after I visited those cities, they’re indelibly linked in my memory for one reason: the foul, polluted air smothering their landscapes. The pollution was so heavy you could see it wafting through the interiors of modern buildings (Delhi, 2016), feel it stinging your eyes (Mexico City, 1972), and smell it through closed car windows (Gary, the 1960s).

Despite its ubiquity, or perhaps because of it, air pollution has rarely gotten the sustained attention it deserves. That’s an outrage, given that air pollution is a global killer, causing an astonishing seven million premature deaths every year. But it’s also an opportunity, because this is an environmental problem that we can fix. 

There’s no better example of that than the experience of the United States, which last year celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Clean Air Act. Signed by President Richard Nixon on December 31, 1970, this single statute resulted in a 77 percent decrease in the nation’s air pollution. It lengthened millions of American lives, saved trillions of dollars, and according to the American Lung Association’s Paul Billings, became “the most powerful public health law enacted in the 20th century.”

 “A unique day in American history is ending,” Walter Cronkite intoned on the CBS Evening News on April 22, 1970. The inaugural celebration of Earth Day had drawn some 20 million people to the streets—one of every 10 Americans and a way bigger crowd than the man who’d dreamed up the occasion, U.S. senator Gaylord Nelson, had anticipated. Participants expressed their concern for the environment in exuberant, often idiosyncratic ways. They sang, danced, donned gas masks, and picked up litter. In New York City they dragged dead fish through the streets. In Boston they staged a “die-in” at Logan International Airport. In Philadelphia they signed an oversize, all-species “Declaration of Interdependence.”

“Earth Day did exactly what I had hoped for,” Nelson, a Democrat from Wisconsin, would say later. “It was truly an astonishing grassroots explosion.”

I’ve traveled to the Amazon to report on deforestation, to New Zealand to see the impacts of invasive species, and to Greenland to accompany scientists drilling through the melting ice sheet. I’ve also had kids. I watched with pride when they joined their school’s environmental club and recounted to them—perhaps once or twice too often—my memories of pulling recyclables from the trash in my school cafeteria.

Will Baltimore bridge collapse force U.S. to pay more attention to its infrastructure?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-aging-infrastructure,03-26-2024,"The Francis Scott Key Bridge will get rebuilt with federal funds, but many other structures across the nation aren’t getting the same support.","The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore is the latest example of a challenge to U.S. infrastructure amid a lack of funds and motivation to maintain aging bridges, experts say.

The Baltimore bridge ""is an old and reliable piece of infrastructure, that under almost any reasonable circumstances would be standing in another 20 or 30 years,” says Joseph L. Schofer, professor emeritus of civil and environmental engineering at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering. “If you come along and pull out the primary support, there's no way to save the bridge.”

Though he has no reason to believe negligence was involved in the Baltimore collapse, Schofer says some infrastructure catastrophes are. He points to the Fern Hollow Bridge failure in Pittsburgh as an example: The National Transportation Safety Board concluded reports and recommendations to fix corroded steel supports went ignored, ultimately leading to the collapse of the 447-foot-long bridge, which dropped a bus and four cars to the park below.

The heat alone could kill a lot of us.","SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF. — If greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, rising temperatures and humidity wrought by global warming could expose hundreds of millions of people worldwide to potentially lethal heat stress by 2060, a new report suggests.

The greatest exposure will occur in populous, tropical regions such as India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. But even in the northeastern United States, as many as 30 million people might be exposed at least once a year to heat that could be lethal to children, the elderly, and the sick, according to the new study.

It’s the first study to look at future heat stress on a global basis, says Ethan Coffel, a PhD candidate in atmospheric sciences at Columbia University, who presented the results on Monday at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco. Coffel and his colleagues used climate models and population projections to estimate how many people could face dangerous heat in 2060—assuming that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise sharply on a “business-as-usual” course.

Will charging electric cars ever be as fast as pumping gas?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/will-charging-electric-cars-ever-be-as-fast-as-pumping-gas,06-09-2021,"Slow charging times are holding back potential EV customers, but emerging science says a fast-charging battery is possible.","Electric vehicles are gaining popularity fast, but some prospective buyers remain hesitant. One big reason is that charging EVs is slow. While drivers today are accustomed to filling their gas tank in less than five minutes, EVs, depending on the size and specifications of the battery, typically take at least 30 minutes to get 80 percent charged at the fastest charging stations out there.

In five to 10 years, though, far faster charging might be possible. Companies are developing new lithium-ion battery materials, as well as new “solid state” batteries, which are more stable at faster charging speeds. They could place recharge rates of 20 minute or less within reach.

Meanwhile, a team of scientists recently designed a lithium battery prototype that, under laboratory conditions, can recharge more than 50 percent of its capacity in just three minutes—and do so thousands of times without significantly degrading. This, the researchers say, could pave a path toward batteries that can recharge fully in as little as 10 minutes.

Will the COP26 global deforestation pledge save forests?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/will-the-cop26-global-deforestation-pledge-save-forests,11-04-2021,Skepticism is warranted. But billions of dollars have been promised—and new data on carbon emissions provide grounds for hope.,"The announcement this week of a multinational commitment to end deforestation by 2030 seems, on the face of it, a cause for celebration. But there are concerns that the declaration may be another empty promise and that, without concrete action, deforestation will continue and even accelerate.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson greeted the pact with predictable enthusiasm. “These great teeming ecosystems—these pillared cathedrals of nature—are the lungs of our planet,” he proclaimed in Glasgow, site of this year’s UN climate summit, COP26, which runs through November 12. “Let’s work together to not just protect the forest but to ensure that forests return.”

According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), if tropical deforestation were a country, it would be the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide on Earth. Additionally, on balance, the world’s forests are carbon sinks, removing approximately 7.6 billion tons of carbon—roughly 20 percent of global emissions—from the atmosphere each year. An agreement to remove those emissions and protect that carbon sink would be a significant achievement for the conference Johnson's government is hosting.

The rainforests of the sea, coral reefs play vital roles in the health of the ocean. But as a new study makes clear, humans’ influence on Earth’s climate is pushing them to the brink.

The analysis, published on Thursday in Science, takes a fresh look at the health of 100 coral reefs from around the world, stitching together a record from 1980 to 2016 from government documents, scientific studies, and media reports.

This approach corrects for the biases found in other, more spottily maintained databases—and paints a grim picture. On average, the study finds that the amount of time between severe bleaching events, which gravely wound coral reefs, has shrunk by a factor of five.

Weighing more than three pounds, with a wingspan of four feet or more, it can take down prey twice its size.

It’s also the only Arctic raptor that doesn’t need to head south for the winter, staying behind instead to hunt prey in a frigid, dark landscape. “Any organism that can live in such a hostile environment has my respect,” says Travis Booms, a raptor biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

But the gyrfalcon faces a challenge it cannot flee or take down: The Arctic is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and biologists consider gyrfalcons one of the region’s most vulnerable species, in part because they’re ultra-specialized to survive in the cold. While many species are shifting their ranges toward the cooler poles as temperatures climb, the gyrfalcon can’t go any farther north.

Your favorite foods are at risk from a rapidly warming planet,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/your-favorite-foods-are-at-risk-from-a-rapidly-warming-planet,03-25-2020,"Avocados, coffee, and more could be subject to change—from how they’re grown to when we eat them.","This story is part of the pessimistic argument for the future of the planet in our special issue on Earth Day. Read the optimistic argument and the rest of our stories here.

Even in the best growing conditions—with moderate weather, predictable rainfall, and rounded seasons—growing food is hard. Add in climate volatility, erratic floods, and frequent drought, and the entire food system becomes an equation of anxiety, hope, and in some regions, dread. “We have a climate change threat to our food system and not many strategies to deal with it,” says Michael Puma of Columbia University’s Earth Institute.

What will that mean for our plates? Global commodities such as corn and wheat are susceptible to dramatic shifts in growing regions and crop output. The UN says that without strategies for adapting, lower staple yields will lead to shortages and increased prices for human and livestock consumption, hitting developing tropical countries the hardest. More charismatic foods, like the ones shown here, will morph in appearance, nutritional value, availability, and price as growing regions shift and farmers turn to warm-weather crops. Longer growing seasons are generally good news for farmers and plants, but lack of rainfall or insufficient cold weather could stunt even the best-laid seeds and plans.

Innovation will be part of foods’ evolution, in the field and in the lab. Seed breeding and gene editing are helping some fruits and vegetables grow faster and bigger to outrun a season’s heightened probability of flood or drought. Other technologies help food last longer to be shipped farther, in some cases not requiring refrigeration at all.

The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that the planet won’t lose much arable land before 2050 and that few foods will disappear completely—but over the coming decades, crops and diets will evolve. Retaining the world’s favorite foods and making them accessible to more people will require eating smarter, says Charlotte Streck, director of Dutch-based think tank Climate Focus. That means less meat, more plants, and getting all you can from as close as possible.

1. Coffee
Almost three-quarters of coffee comes from small farms. Warmer weather and plant diseases may drive up the price.

2. Avocados
This fruit’s trees don’t like high heat. If growers shift to kinder environs, it could lengthen shipping distances.

3. Shrimp
Ocean acidification affects crustaceans’ health—and taste. Future shrimp may be less palatable, one study says.

4. Salmon
Warming water threatens this and other cold water fish. Less wild breeding may spur more farming to maintain supply.

5. Wine
The beverage will endure, but changes in terroirs will force vintners to find ways to maintain wines’ signature tastes.

6. Olives
Early frosts, heavy rain, and wind halved Italy’s production last year. Such extremes could limit crops in many places.

7. Bananas
So far, warming has expanded the tropical fruit’s growing area—and raised the risk of fungi that devastate plants.

Susan Goldberg: Roughly two-thirds of people will live in cities by 2050. There are 31 cities now that are considered megacities, with 10 million people or more; by 2030 there’ll be 41 cities of that size. Why are people flocking to cities?

Michael Bloomberg: The marketplace is clearly saying this is where we want to be. Big cities provide culture; they can be much more cosmopolitan and give you a faster pace of life. It’s not for everybody; some people want a different pace, and there’s nothing wrong with that. I had the governor of Montana sitting right here yesterday—the whole population of the state is about a million people. I mean, that’s smaller than the Bronx! The beauty of the world is diversity. The beauty of America is basically we get along. There’s lots of places in the world where diversity is not exactly tolerated.

66% of the world’s population will live in an urban area by 2050.

"‘Megadrought’ persists in western U.S., as another extremely dry year develops",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/megadrought-persists-in-western-us-as-another-extremely-dry-year-develops,05-07-2021,"The long-running dry stretch rivals anything in the last 1200 years, a sign of climate-change induced ""aridification.""","Water levels usually peak in May at Folsom Lake in California, rising as Sierra Nevada snowpack melts away and courses down to the reservoir, near Sacramento.

But this year, the drought that has gripped much of the U.S. West is already so strong that the lake is only half as full as normal. Instead of water, fields of purple lupines line vast swaths of dry lakebed.

Folsom Lake’s situation is emblematic of the deepening drought across the western United States. As of May 6, 67 percent of the region was in a state of “severe” drought or worse; a stunning 21 percent is already in “exceptional” drought, the worst category in the U.S. Drought Monitor’s framework. At Lake Mead, one of the two major reservoirs of the Colorado River, which some 40 million Americans depend on, water levels are creeping toward a threshold that would trigger the first official shortage declaration for the basin.  Water levels usually peak in May at Folsom Lake in California, rising as Sierra Nevada snowpack melts away and courses down to the reservoir, near Sacramento.

‘Off-the-charts’ heat to affect millions in U.S. in coming decades,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/extreme-heat-to-affect-millions-of-americans,07-16-2019,"Within 60 years, hot days in the U.S. could be so intense that the current heat index can’t measure them.","In less than 20 years, millions of people in the United States could be exposed to dangerous “off-the-charts” heat conditions of 127 degrees Fahrenheit or more, a startling new report has found. In 60 years over one-third of the population could be exposed to such conditions, “posing unprecedented health risks,” the report says.

‘Show Up With Hope’: Anne Lamott’s Plan for Facing Adversity,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/embark-essay-anne-lamott-hope-adversity-conflict-climate-change,09-13-2018,"With Earth beset by conflict, climate change, pollution, and other ills, the best-selling author asks: What better time to be hopeful?","This story appears in the October 2018 issue of National Geographic magazine.

You would almost have to be nuts to be filled with hope in a world so rife with hunger, hatred, climate change, pollution, and pestilence, let alone the self-destructive or severely annoying behavior of certain people, both famous and just down the hall, none of whom we will name by name.

Yet I have boundless hope, most of the time. Hope is a sometimes cranky optimism, trust, and confidence that those I love will be OK—that they will come through, whatever life holds in store. Hope is the belief that no matter how dire things look or how long rescue or healing takes, modern science in tandem with people’s goodness and caring will boggle our minds, in the best way.

Hope is (for me) not usually the religious-looking fingers of light slanting through the clouds, or the lurid sunrise. It’s more a sturdy garment, like an old chamois shirt: a reminder that I’ve been here before, in circumstances just as frightening, and I came through, and will again. All I have to do is stay grounded in the truth.

By showing up with hope to help others, I’m guaranteed that hope is present. Then my own hope increases. By creating hope for others, I end up awash in the stuff.

Oh, that’s very nice, you may well respond. And what does that even mean, the truth?

I don’t presume to say what capital-T Truth is. But I do know my truth, and it’s this: Everyone I know, including me, has lived through devastating times at least twice, through seemingly unsurvivable loss. And yet we have come through because of the love of our closest people, the weird healing properties of time, random benevolence, and, of course, our dogs.

‘There Are Things We Can Do’ About Climate Change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/151015-qa-biologist-thomas-lovejoy,10-15-2015,Conservationist Thomas Lovejoy wants us to be more frugal in the present—and upset about the future.,"Biologist and conservationist Thomas Lovejoy has been working in the Amazon rain forest for 50 years. He coined the term “biological diversity” in 1980, the same year he projected that by the early 21st century the world would lose a dramatic number of species. But Lovejoy, now 74, is still optimistic about protecting the planet. And he has ideas.

Boil it down. What’s the top environmental challenge?

It’s a combination of people and their aspirations. If the aspirations are more like the frugal ones we had after the Second World War, a lot more is possible than if we view the planet as a giant shopping mall, which doesn’t work biologically. We need to get beyond the fascination with the glitter and understand that the planet works as a biological system. Reducing our expectations is very much in our own interest.

You’re in a room with the leaders of China, India, and the United States. What would you tell them?

I’d say we all have an interest in fixing this before it gets badly out of hand, and it’s getting close to that. There are things we can do together. There are energy and innovation possibilities. There are biological solutions that would benefit everyone. India could offset all of its current emissions through ecosystem restoration. All those countries have a combined interest in a major international effort at restoration, and there are benefits from working on it together.

"‘This season has been relentless.’ Still reeling, Louisiana braces for Hurricane Delta",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/still-reeling-louisiana-braces-for-hurricane-delta,10-08-2020,"With 8,000 people still sheltering from Laura, the Gulf Coast prepares for another major storm.","At the Salvation Army in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a shelter that normally provides meals to the homeless is preparing more food for those who may be without homes this weekend after Hurricane Delta passes through.

“There’s no doubt resources are stressed,” said Donald Tekautz, the head of the city’s Salvation Army division. “This has been a tough summer. Finances, supplies, food, water—we always try to have supplies on hand, and a lot of it we sent to Lake Charles when their need was great.” That was just over a month ago, after Hurricane Laura hit the same swath of southwest Louisiana that is now waiting on Delta.

When a disaster strikes this region, the state and Red Cross provide most of the shelter, while the Salvation Army focuses on food and household items. Tekautz is confident that the organization will still be equipped to help those who need it.

‘Zombie’ fires in the Arctic are linked to climate change,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/zombie-fires-in-the-arctic-are-linked-to-climate-change,05-19-2021,Hotter summers and longer burn seasons mean fires from the previous year may come back to life the following spring,"In the far North, fire season usually doesn’t start until June, when snow has melted away and summer lightning storms sweep into the region. So scientist Sander Veraverbeke was confused when in May of 2016 he saw little flecks of fire on some satellite images from Alaska and the Northwest Territories.

“I was like, what the hell is going on?” says Veraverbeke, an Earth scientist at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

What he saw on the satellite images were “zombie fires,” remnants of burns from the previous year that somehow stayed alive, smoldering underground, through the long, cold winter.
